00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>wearing sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a point in time when I moved</v>

13
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:25.364
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I remember well for a while they were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription.</v>

15
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>So I had an excuse for a long time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back to contacts.</v>

16
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>But there was a point in time when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember turning to my friend,</v>

17
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I was like 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

18
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm just going to keep them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and then it'll just be a</v>

19
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that way I can just,</v>

20
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>if I have to close my eyes and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>will notice or if I'm stoned,</v>

21
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>nobody will notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people get super famous like Jay z</v>

22
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were um,</v>

23
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>inside everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so people don't catch a glimpse of</v>

24
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>their eyes handed him a demo tape.</v>

<v Speaker 1>them then?</v>

26
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.310

<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>world or whatever and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chapters that deal with the incident.</v>

101
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't even realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even realize this is the thing</v>

102
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 3>like adding dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am so out of the loop with,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

107
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really good at paying attention</v>
<v Speaker 3>to any of it.</v>

108
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Twitter from day one I kind of was in</v>

109
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard for me to actually keep up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and care about it.</v>

110
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:33.130

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

158
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Just yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter and son were making slime</v>

159
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 3>with it and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying the same thing.</v>

160
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

161
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean we had like ectoplasm slime and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nickelodeon slime when I was a kid and</v>

162
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 3>like all but it was not like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden it's like,</v>

163
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>

164
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 3>And you watch the commercials for glue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have glow in the dark glue and</v>

165
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 3>they're like showing a kid making slime</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the elmer.</v>

166
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk about an unexpected boost for</v>

167
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 3>elmers chat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They must have jumped.</v>

168
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 3>He wants to jump on tide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They came up timers between tide pods</v>

169
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:58.751
<v Speaker 3>and the slime tides like fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What people really eating detergent</v>

170
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that seems like it would be</v>

171
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.870
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably bad for your body to eat a</v>
<v Speaker 3>detergent.</v>

172
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.610
<v Speaker 3>We used to huff like Scotch guard when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were kids or Potpourri.</v>

173
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe it's a smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Markers.</v>

174
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to love the smell of like a good</v>

175
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 3>sharpie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fat one.</v>

176
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.660
<v Speaker 3>Do the thing in school for you where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grab you and they,</v>

177
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 3>they pull you up and then you almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass out and then they let you go.</v>

178
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 3>And we used to do that in elementary</v>
<v Speaker 3>school where they,</v>

179
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

180
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 3>how'd that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I would get behind these.</v>

181
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 3>You pick it up and then she told you or</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit.</v>

182
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you can't basically breathe.</v>

183
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 3>You're almost suffocating and then let</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go and then you're like,</v>

184
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 3>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

185
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

186
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids are always trying to,</v>

187
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even monkeys,</v>

188
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:46.041
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

189
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 3>animals try to change their state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

190
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

191
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it's just a natural thing.</v>

192
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 3>The creatures tried to change your</v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

193
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 3>change your state of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even little kids.</v>

194
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder about that slime stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I genuinely,</v>

195
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 3>genuinely worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people I don't think had been</v>

196
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:07.421
<v Speaker 3>dealing with large volumes of glue and</v>
<v Speaker 3>detergent like that with the physicals</v>

197
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another one.</v>

198
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Borax is,</v>

199
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking toxic.</v>

200
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 3>You think gets in your skin is an organ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't realize that.</v>

201
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 3>You don't think about that when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray it on all the different shit that</v>

202
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>people put on their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think about that when I use</v>

203
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 3>sunscreen.</v>

204
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this stuff right here?</v>

205
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 3>You're blocking your pores with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goo,</v>

206
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 3>some good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

207
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 3>it's also your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your skin's absorbing it.</v>

208
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

209
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 3>like when you go in that isolation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the best ways to absorb</v>

210
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 3>magnesium because of the epsom salts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you float around in the tank,</v>

211
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 3>the epsom salts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body absorbs magnesium from talking</v>

213
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:41.380
<v Speaker 3>about altered states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

214
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

215
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.780

<v Speaker 3>I still haven't done dmt.</v>

216
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 3>We had that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

217
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 3>We haven't had a conversation about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck have we only done one other</v>

218
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:51.300
<v Speaker 3>podcasts together.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've made it in this town.</v>

231
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 3>If they know me by name there and I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>always get a spot at the bar.</v>

232

240
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 3>I had the balls to walk up to him one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recent times and I was like,</v>

241
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

244
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

245
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.363
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

246
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 3>he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

247
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what side you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is just always on fire with that and</v>

248
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes doing it just to aggravate</v>

249
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:49.891
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Well he see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like he's done with the whole</v>

251
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:54.070
<v Speaker 3>acting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

252
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said he invested in apple in the 80s</v>

253
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 3>and he's fine with being blacklisted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

254
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>

255
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>He bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made a tweet or something like that.</v>

256
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.780
<v Speaker 3>The investment in Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

257
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

258
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 3>That's how weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just say,</v>

259
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 3>I think this company is going to kick</v>
<v Speaker 3>some ass.</v>

260
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 3>We by piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

261
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd get a piece of a company</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they become the apple.</v>

262
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Apple apparently has a more than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trillion dollars now.</v>

263
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 3>I know that and then insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of dangerous.</v>

264
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Anybody to have that kind of influence</v>
<v Speaker 3>though with these phones and shit.</v>

265
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty dangerous.</v>

266
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 3>I kind of trust them with data though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like even with they're trying to</v>

267
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

268
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Well Google has a weird trying to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

269
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 3>will they also have secret servers in</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea and shit?</v>

270
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean they just have servers set</v>

271
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:45.300
<v Speaker 3>up and all these other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of that up danger cause I didn't</v>

272
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.990
<v Speaker 3>trust any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing in north?</v>

273
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Pics Rovers full of,</v>

274
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I think there's all kinds of networks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had been going on for years that</v>

275
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.260
<v Speaker 3>are involved in shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I like I was,</v>

276
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell my friends or my drummer</v>

277
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 3>specifically I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

278
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:04.060
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I like,</v>

279
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a rich guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I think that there's a point of</v>

280
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 3>money that I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know the threshold in</v>

281
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 3>which you get past that and then like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Saudis and then all the,</v>

282
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>all these people start coming in wanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part of you and then you start selling</v>

283
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 3>your soul.</v>

284
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Like whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's 5 million bucks,</v>

285
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 3>I just got to stay right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

286
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get richer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you have influence,</v>

287
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a scary world.</v>

288
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:28.430
<v Speaker 3>So I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of concern with</v>

289
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 3>people wonder whether or not someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>been like,</v>

290
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.750
<v Speaker 3>I've been accused of being approached</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that of my cia acid or that I,</v>

293
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:41.251

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

294
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I've been approached to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth being round to be around round</v>

295
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Earth shill.</v>

299
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>or the shield shell is like saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that the Reptilian people went</v>

300
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>to you to be a human shill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All someone told me that,</v>

301
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>someone told me that they believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's reptilians underneath the earth</v>

302
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 1>and that they have a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've carved tunnels through the</v>

303
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 1>ground with laser beams and to have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a network of tunnels they use,</v>

304
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they travel amongst us,</v>

305
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 1>waiting for their time to expose</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

306
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.420
<v Speaker 1>People believe like you see someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

307
00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 1>You live in an apartment building and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried by a dude's house,</v>

308
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>got a fat house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

309
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got a fat house.</v>

310
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder who he knows.</v>

311
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he's like he's in with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mob or maybe he's deep with the</v>

312
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Democrats or maybe he's the bankers or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cusco.</v>

313
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Who's he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who does he know?</v>

314
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Because you always think of like someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being like at a level where you're,</v>

315
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you're you like they sit you in a room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they give you some communications</v>

316
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that you're not supposed to expose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>

317
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.761
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

318
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I,</v>

319
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.120
<v Speaker 1>what I was saying about the threshold of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

320
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:52.130
<v Speaker 1>There is a point and you know it's there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which in,</v>

321
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean Google started with a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes who were like,</v>

322
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:57.940
<v Speaker 1>we got this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was before that there was a thing</v>

323
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 1>called web crawler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of the first experience</v>

324
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me of a search engine that I'd ever</v>

342
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Amazon has cia contracts that's known</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they use their servers to do</v>

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a number of ways in which people</v>

350
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:03.880
<v Speaker 1>start approaching you and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

351
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you've got too much influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to join our group and</v>

352
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 1>we'll support you and you'll make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

353
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's level.</v>

354
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Italy.</v>

355
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I just got back and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

356
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a boat from um,</v>

357
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Amalfi coast,</v>

358
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>took a boat from a mall free to Capri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an island house.</v>

359
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Gorgeous Matte.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're there,</v>

360
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you see the crazy yachts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Steve Jobs has a yacht.</v>

361
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he had built before he died and now</v>

362
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 1>his family owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leo Dicaprio and Bella Hadid and his,</v>

363
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.220
<v Speaker 1>his yacht looks like an apple store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing.</v>

364
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:42.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

365
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>we drove right by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yachts are weird too because they're</v>

366
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>worth like a hundred million bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could basically look,</v>

367
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>drive up and smack it like no one has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

368
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

369
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how pirates work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

370
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>You can just hop onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a grappling hook up and they climb</v>

371
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:00.630
<v Speaker 1>on top of your yacht,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're driving by,</v>

372
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>he's got smack it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of,</v>

373
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

374
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a floating apple store that I don't</v>

375
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 1>want to have to deal with that and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance and everything.</v>

376
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather just just first class it</v>

377
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.630
<v Speaker 1>and a and go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>go on a trip and maybe rent that yacht</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like,</v>

379
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 1>if I had the money to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even renting that I would be like a half</v>

380
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 1>a million dollars a week.</v>

381
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get a boat and go up to it and</v>

382
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>write it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between the experience in</v>

383
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 1>a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big and an experience at a boat</v>

384
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>that's like a fraction of that science</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not that different.</v>

385
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Like that's pretty fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately it's like a Ho like</v>

386
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a good impression of what it's</v>

387
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:40.724
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

388
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really do it justice in an</v>

389
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>image because it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so modern,</v>

390
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

391
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:47.691
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

392
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 1>when you get near it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange looking.</v>

393
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

394
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be awesome to party on that for</v>

395
00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>like a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be the best of it would suck.</v>

396
00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Look at that boat that just pulled right</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

397
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo Steve,</v>

398
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 1>my fucking eye pads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

399
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fucking ipad just broke.</v>

400
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

401
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he ever ride it?</v>

402
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:13.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

403
00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 1>he shit the bed before he wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's really fascinating,</v>

404
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I read something about he died of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pancreatic cancer and one of the things</v>

405
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 1>he did was he drink fruit juice every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and we used to think the fruit juice</v>

406
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 1>is really good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

407
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You're drinking fruit now they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

408
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.183
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fruit.</v>

409
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>It was really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But drinking fruit juices is kind of an</v>

410
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:34.460
<v Speaker 1>unnatural state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fiber in that.</v>

411
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 1>So you're just drinking straight sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they say that drinking like a</v>

412
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 1>glass of fresh squeezed orange juice has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sugar as drinking a can of</v>

413
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 1>soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you really,</v>

414
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:48.990
<v Speaker 1>your body doesn't differentiate much</v>
<v Speaker 1>between chemicals and soda though</v>

415
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 1>chemicals are not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

416
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Some chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them,</v>

417
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.220
<v Speaker 1>they're innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could drink,</v>

418
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 1>like I was reading something about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet coke,</v>

419
00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 1>like someone was saying like Diet Coke</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you brain cancer.</v>

420
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's her saying that it prevents</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

421
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 1>What they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article I read recently</v>

422
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 1>that was saying that they thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet Cola is actually helped it.</v>

423
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>They flipped their a script on that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a little fast talk at the end</v>

424
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:15.614
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

425
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.730
<v Speaker 1>dot spots.</v>

426
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

427
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:26.420
<v Speaker 1>that fast talk shit should be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that's not illegal.</v>

428
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Remember they used to do that at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those goddamn commercials,</v>

429
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 1>they hire somebody who talks like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnival barker.</v>

430
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Whole commercial like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be awesome man.</v>

431
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it all ineffective here.</v>

432
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.430
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

433
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.810
<v Speaker 1>could die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coke help curb colon cancer's return.</v>

434
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet coke?</v>

435
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Who fucking see new study shows that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin can,</v>

436
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

437
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Fucking studies dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies are a problem because you,</v>

438
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 1>you can get like there was a study</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted recently.</v>

439
00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a questionnaire that showed that people</v>

440
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:04.010
<v Speaker 1>who eat higher carb diets live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

441
00:18:04.011 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a questionnaire that over</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 something years of like what you eat</v>

442
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 1>and then the people who died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was all sorts of problems</v>

443
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't exercise as much.</v>

444
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 1>They were fatter than the people who ate</v>
<v Speaker 1>more carbs.</v>

445
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And also you're asking people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember what they ate,</v>

446
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 1>which is like very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ineffective.</v>

447
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And then the same cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same place,</v>

448
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>put out a study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

449
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 1>really recently that showed the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite effect.</v>

450
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

451
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck if I'm just a regular guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who barely has time to read the paper</v>

452
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>and I read a study every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically like what you catch,</v>

453
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you can catch some second ausas found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that about half of the benefit appear to</v>

454
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 1>be due to people switching from regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>to diet sodas.</v>

455
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the colon cancer was really just,</v>

456
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you stopped drinking coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coke was giving you colon cancer.</v>

457
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 1>So now diet coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coke prevents colon cancer.</v>

458
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no coke gives you fucking colon cancer.</v>

459
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to know.</v>

460
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

461
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot,</v>

462
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I try now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with the Internet and</v>

463
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day when we just didn't know</v>

464
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:10.380
<v Speaker 1>shit at,</v>

641
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:21.231
<v Speaker 1>coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know.</v>

642
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:23.970
<v Speaker 1>He was actually getting it deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

643
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>deep state telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you to find the threshold.</v>

644
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And he learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he learned how to read and it's a great</v>

645
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:34.970
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricky learned how to read in jail and</v>

646
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.971
<v Speaker 1>then learn how to become a lawyer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail and then realize they tried him for</v>

647
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.541
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

648
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 1>They hit him with three strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they hit him with two charges at the</v>

649
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not how three strikes work.</v>

650
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.430
<v Speaker 1>So you went to jail for life and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>got released for time for time served</v>

651
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.010

<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones got high as fuck on high.</v>

728
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 3>That was fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to come back on and I just</v>

729

<v Speaker 3>don't know if I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh come on,</v>

731
00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>They are shutting them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is he still on trial</v>

732
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole trial that's going on with</v>

733
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 3>the Sandy Hook and all that shit has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be resolved for us.</v>

734
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't mean like Bill Maher</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect to Bill Maher.</v>

735
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 3>I respect him for saying he gets to</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak to,</v>

736
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 3>he was on his show and people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>clapping and cheering that he was pulled</v>

737
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:26.770
<v Speaker 3>off of these networks and pulled off of</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

738
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

739
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 3>this guy has said crazy lies about me is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Bill Maher said.</v>

740
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 3>He said to the guy said crazy lies about</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

741
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he still gets to talk like this is</v>

742
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 3>what America is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free speech means all speech.</v>

743
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 3>But see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I don't understand.</v>

744
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Like Alex had me on many times and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>supported my record.</v>

745
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Black ribbon sort of Cayman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

746
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.450
<v Speaker 3>You've been on the Alex Jones show many</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

747
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on it three times.</v>

748
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Where you ever sober?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

749
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

750
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't show sober.</v>

751
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.161
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

752
00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:54.640
<v Speaker 3>it was never a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

753
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 3>the first time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

754
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 3>we have the black ribbons record that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did as Steven King and stuff like,</v>

755
00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:02.860
<v Speaker 3>so when that record came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody would support the record.</v>

756
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So Alex and things on your record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

757
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 3>older record from what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he plays,</v>

758
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.740
<v Speaker 3>he plays a Dj or a radio talk show hosts</v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes in and out of the record.</v>

759
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen King.</v>

760
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Stephen King.</v>

761
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 3>So like when I did that record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones is the only person that would</v>

762
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:23.380
<v Speaker 3>support the record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put it,</v>

763
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.260
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he debuted the whole record on his show</v>

764
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 3>and then I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on for two hours by phone and</v>

765
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 3>then I went in and was on his show in</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

766
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about just the music business.</v>

767
00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 3>That's all we were talking about and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of how things were.</v>

768
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 3>And then later I was on for bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion kind of,</v>

769
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by skype or something.</v>

770
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 3>But I will say this in his defense in</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this,</v>

771
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I just think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

772
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.180
<v Speaker 3>that guy has been saying things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories about all kinds of</v>

773
00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:53.100
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want?</v>

774
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Call him that or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd like forever.</v>

775
00:31:55.690 --> 00:32:00.690
<v Speaker 3>And like now the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation is like so volatile that</v>

776
00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 3>like they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

777
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 3>the sandy hook thing.</v>

778
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.310
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like they definitely caught fucking</v>

779
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Cooper having the green screen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's probably because they had</v>

780
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:13.740
<v Speaker 3>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're talking to the mom and then they</v>

781
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 3>know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of Anderson Cooper</v>

782
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 3>interviewing one of the moms from Sandy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hook and he walked,</v>

783
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.550
<v Speaker 3>he leans a little too far forward and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his nose disappears and it's probably</v>

784
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:29.551
<v Speaker 3>because they had a standing report or</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to the mom and what Anderson</v>

785
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Cooper was then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

786
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 3>put in via,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

787
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 3>whatever crane and like you kind of need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see that is there,</v>

788
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this is where we're propelling,</v>

789
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.540
<v Speaker 3>but my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

790
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sandy hook,</v>

791
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I remember where I was when I heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>about sandy hook and it was horrific.</v>

792
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 3>And I don't believe for a second that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

793
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.360
<v Speaker 3>it's all fake or anything like that.</v>

794
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 3>But like Alex's thing has always been</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I remember watching him go to</v>

795
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Bohemian Grove and when we did the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking record on,</v>

796
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 3>this is back when nobody was paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to them.</v>

797
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 3>It just certain small group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember we did the black ribbons</v>

798
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:06.500
<v Speaker 3>record and we took a clip of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>

799
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.680
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he snuck into Bohemian Grove and film</v>

800
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 3>the ceremony and there like a scene</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they were not a scene.</v>

801
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I get the scene in his film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a part of that where they're</v>

802
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 3>doing the ceremony and they have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

803
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like Disneyland when you go well</v>
<v Speaker 3>look to our God.</v>

804
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

805
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's done in a way where it's like</v>

806
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland when you watch like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ferries fly around the castle.</v>

807
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:34.241
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a whole thing where there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like a laugh that happens at the end</v>

808
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 3>of the MOLEC thing or whatever.</v>

809
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Or the big Al and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the funeral pyres drove.</v>

810
00:33:39.331 --> 00:33:40.730
<v Speaker 3>So druids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

811
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 3>So like I used a part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember watching that documentary</v>

812
00:33:43.941 --> 00:33:44.690
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

813
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 3>his deal has always been so over the top</v>
<v Speaker 3>where like you go,</v>

814
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the,</v>

815
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.250

<v Speaker 3>go to the local people aren't near</v>

816

<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

817
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 3>we're looking for where the Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's go to go do the thing,</v>

818
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's obviously at this point,</v>

819
00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:59.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not like people who are knowingly</v>
<v Speaker 3>satanist.</v>

820
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like really old fat rich guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>go there and there's probably hookers</v>

821
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of shit because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens at big rich things,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so he get away with it.</v>

823
00:34:10.411 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Kelly thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just feel bad for it.</v>

826
00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the Manga because that was</v>

827
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:23.240
<v Speaker 3>clearly a hidden piece with Alex because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>

828
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.270
<v Speaker 3>she buddied up to him and then then</v>

<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:32.900
<v Speaker 3>they had their talk in her defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could she not?</v>

831
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Of course she's got us if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come,</v>

832
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.490

<v Speaker 3>but if I came here with the,</v>

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:44.450
<v Speaker 3>with the intention of like just talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and then all of a sudden you were</v>

834
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:45.284
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

836
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 3>like you focused on this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is a hit piece.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get more shit from being friends with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones and anything in my life</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm just saying like,</v>

843
00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:09.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'll get hit for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is,</v>

00:35:09.911 --> 00:35:12.910
<v Speaker 3>is that point check checker twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready for it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

847
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

848
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not even here from like the side</v>

849
00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 3>of the political point of view is this</v>

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you see what it says was debunked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which means happens.</v>

854
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:38.623
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wasn't bad.</v>

857
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Quality video right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll play about three seconds.</v>

858
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

859
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird part on his nose that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

860
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:49.300
<v Speaker 1>But to say it's a green screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just,</v>

861
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I would tell the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people that are looking for</v>

862
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use this to say that the space</v>

863
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 1>station didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

864
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick right around right there.</v>

865
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Hold on some and you can't even really</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>

866
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.400
<v Speaker 1>It's something really happened to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>super quick.</v>

867
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like a digital glitch.</v>

868
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

869
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what they said.</v>

870
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't find it anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other piece he leans forward is no,</v>

871
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.240
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think.</v>

872
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that they had a stand in because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't be there,</v>

873
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be wrong,</v>

874
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be.</v>

875
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.470
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about several years ago</v>

876
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you might have been fucked up memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

877

<v Speaker 1>was there all week shooting from the</v>

878
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:29.460

<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was,</v>

879
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got You.</v>

880
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.510
<v Speaker 1>They got to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shooter Jennings.</v>

881
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I would say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

882
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you make more than a hundred thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars a year.</v>

883
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Dude knocks on your door and starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about conspiracy.</v>

884
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make it $34,000 a year,</v>

885
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you look at people to make 100,000 like</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

886

<v Speaker 1>Well you got to sell out son.</v>

888
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 1>But that's how people look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is a threshold.</v>

889
00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 1>There is a threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was broke,</v>

890
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I had an a suburban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't broke but it was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was doing it right but I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>suburban and some guy and I got into a</v>

892
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:08.100

<v Speaker 3>I have that like I already had the rich</v>

896
00:37:23.951 --> 00:37:26.710
<v Speaker 3>thing because people thought that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich because my dad,</v>

897
00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:28.510

<v Speaker 3>I never was.</v>

898
00:37:28.511 --> 00:37:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was supportive of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once I got here it was,</v>

899
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.980
<v Speaker 3>I was Kinda on my own and I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then then once I talk about bitcoin</v>

900
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.060
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking five years ago or whenever</v>

901
00:37:37.061 --> 00:37:38.660
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was here three years ago and</v>

902
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.431
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I mean look,</v>

905
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.640
<v Speaker 3>what's the point up til like seven grand</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

906
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It went up to 19 zero seconds.</v>

907
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Keep going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hadn't dropped very much below six</v>

908
00:37:51.671 --> 00:37:53.890
<v Speaker 3>grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean when I was here with you it</v>

909
00:37:53.891 --> 00:37:55.600
<v Speaker 3>was like less than a grant.</v>

910
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:59.350
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm trying to say about</v>

911
00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:03.700
<v Speaker 3>this is not like I'm not validating his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Anderson Cooper thing,</v>

912
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.290
<v Speaker 3>but that dude has always been fishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>for things like that and it's always</v>

913
00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:12.400
<v Speaker 3>been his gig and it's been as Gig from</v>
<v Speaker 3>columbine.</v>

914
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.970
<v Speaker 3>It's been as Gig from all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I understand that the passion and</v>

915
00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:19.540
<v Speaker 3>the emotion involved with the children</v>
<v Speaker 3>that died in sandy hook.</v>

916
00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:22.090
<v Speaker 3>And I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not defending him on that deal.</v>

917
00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:25.420
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's always been this guy's Gig.</v>

918
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.360
<v Speaker 3>I feel like dad is where he legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

919
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't think if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take away,</v>

920
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I got to defend him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't say to fucking fuck up.</v>

921
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this</v>

922
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 5>is a silly fuckup he's saying that for</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure it was a fake,</v>

923
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 5>but did he say for sure it's a Aa did</v>
<v Speaker 5>people sent me the clip?</v>

924
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 5>They sent me the clip of him saying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was 100% fake.</v>

925
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.610
<v Speaker 5>He thought it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he said it,</v>

926
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.970
<v Speaker 5>but he thought it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

927
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 5>he thought it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he thought it was a false flag.</v>

928
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 5>So he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

929
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 5>but that's part of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a part of the conspiratorial</v>

930
00:38:57.971 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 5>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a real problem.</v>

931
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 5>It's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

932
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 5>he said some shit about me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said said some shit about me and it's</v>

933
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 5>100% not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that the post your interview</v>

934
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 5>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

935
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I think it was post,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was post.</v>

936
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 5>He said that the government threatened</v>
<v Speaker 5>my family to stop talking about</v>

937
00:39:15.521 --> 00:39:17.260
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

938
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody threatened my family.</v>

939
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 5>No one zero never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did Not happen.</v>

940
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.250
<v Speaker 5>It is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a lie.</v>

941
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 5>Someone told it to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

942
00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.610
<v Speaker 5>or he says someone told to him.</v>

943
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.250
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

944
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.560
<v Speaker 5>it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so,</v>

945
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.870
<v Speaker 5>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand,</v>

946
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.880
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you understand like how frustrating that</v>

947
00:39:35.881 --> 00:39:37.350
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a minor thing.</v>

948
00:39:37.351 --> 00:39:40.440
<v Speaker 5>Someone him lying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not lying.</v>

949
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>

950
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:42.690
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone told him,</v>

951
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.490
<v Speaker 5>I believe he's telling the truth,</v>

952
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 5>but it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could have fucking called me.</v>

953
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:49.840
<v Speaker 5>He's got my number man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Call me.</v>

954
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 5>So he didn't even bother calling me</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] about to go live from</v>

955
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:54.154
<v Speaker 5>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Texas.</v>

956
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 5>I need to know did someone threaten your</v>
<v Speaker 5>family?</v>

957
00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:59.500

<v Speaker 5>big foot sturgeon.</v>

958
00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:03.360
<v Speaker 5>Same Magic to fucking imagine that going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to threaten you to,</v>

959
00:40:03.361 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 5>you got to stop talking about big foot</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

960

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well no,</v>

961
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:07.781
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found,</v>

962
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:10.150
<v Speaker 5>I did a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a well documented,</v>

963
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:11.860
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about it a hundred times in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the podcast.</v>

964
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 5>I did a show called Joe Rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything and during that show,</v>

965
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 5>over a period of six months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking question a lot of shit</v>

966
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 5>legitimately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did it with researchers.</v>

967
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 5>We had the staff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had producers,</v>

968
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.320
<v Speaker 5>we went and we actually went to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>these places where these people are</v>

969
00:40:33.251 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 5>claiming to see you fo's who went to</v>
<v Speaker 5>these places where people are claiming</v>

970
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 5>to be able to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that shit they do?</v>

971
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.080
<v Speaker 5>Remote viewing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remote view.</v>

972
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked to those guys.</v>

973
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 5>Great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked to all these people and I</v>

974
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:50.650
<v Speaker 5>found a real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a clear thread through all of it that I</v>

975
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 5>documented in my 2014 comedy central</v>
<v Speaker 5>special where I said,</v>

976
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:57.820
<v Speaker 5>here's what you don't find.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you go looking for bigfoot black</v>

977
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you do find is unfuckable white</v>

978
00:41:01.871 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 5>dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will more likely define big foot.</v>

979
00:41:05.741 --> 00:41:09.370
<v Speaker 5>Then you are black people out looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>for big wholesale alien abductions</v>

980
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 5>probably can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dudes you can't get laid and they</v>

981
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:13.920
<v Speaker 5>go looking for hidden mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It need that.</v>

982
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 5>This is a real big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

983
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.930
<v Speaker 5>My point is from doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>show it,</v>

984
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:24.010
<v Speaker 5>it's soured me off conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conspiracy theories were fun for me and</v>

985
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 5>me and my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially Eddie Bravo mean Eddie Bravo</v>

986
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:30.220
<v Speaker 5>would get high and we'd watched</v>
<v Speaker 5>documentaries on flying rods and all</v>

987
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.700
<v Speaker 5>this ufo documentaries and all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>

988
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 5>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking</v>

989
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Zachariah sitch and she love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

990
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 3>I love that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

991
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chariots of the gods all the time to</v>

992
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 3>get it all falls apart under scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all of it,</v>

993
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.360
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

994
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 3>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it falls apart if you're being a</v>

995
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 3>serious person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you really being honest about</v>

996
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 3>what you actually know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the problem.</v>

997
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like the saint and the parallels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that comparison comparing to Alex</v>

998
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that my family was threatened.</v>

999
00:41:58.671 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My family was never threatened.</v>

1000
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 3>No one ever threatened me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1001
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 3>but he's saying this on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is he saying it?</v>

1002
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Because someone told him and he may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes it and he also thinks it's</v>

1003
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 3>fun to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing to say if you're really</v>

1004
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 3>into conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the problem with these</v>

1005
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 3>fucking conspiracies.</v>

1006
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 3>They say things they don't know are true</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>

1007
00:42:18.381 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're true now.</v>

1008
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 3>This is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just hold on,</v>

1009
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 3>it's fine if it's not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about the Illuminati,</v>

1010
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:26.630
<v Speaker 3>if you talking about your kid getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>

1011
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.870
<v Speaker 3>if your kid's dead and someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1012
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.160
<v Speaker 3>this fucking Tom Smith on the radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you're full of Shit.</v>

1013
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You're a crisis actor and your kid's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead me and you're crying every night.</v>

1014
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You wake up in the middle of night</v>
<v Speaker 3>crying because some fucking guy,</v>

1015
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.360
<v Speaker 3>but you are a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just visiting this right to be Alex</v>

1016
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and I defend that as well</v>

1017
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 3>for being David.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll coat one time I would have David</v>

1018
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Allen Coe do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played a show with David [inaudible].</v>

1019
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 3>This is not any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get sandy hook out of this because</v>

1020
00:42:56.691 --> 00:43:00.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's make some defending the right of</v>

1021
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:02.150
<v Speaker 3>people to be who they are.</v>

1022
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.430
<v Speaker 3>And I love David Alinka is music and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1023
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.460
<v Speaker 3>but I played a show with David Onco one</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and my dad always would tell me</v>

1024
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 3>these things about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1025
00:43:11.451 --> 00:43:12.200
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really,</v>

1026
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.410
<v Speaker 3>he liked David and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was always kind of a little</v>

1027
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:18.830
<v Speaker 3>distance of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a showman ship part of him and</v>

1028
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:21.290
<v Speaker 3>they're like a good example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1029
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:25.790
<v Speaker 3>distancing from sandy hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a good part of it was that when,</v>

1030
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 3>when David Allan Coe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a show with him one time my mom</v>

1031
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 3>was over on the side of the stage of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was opening for him.</v>

1032
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:34.190
<v Speaker 3>This is many years ago before I even had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a first record out or anything.</v>

1033
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and David Onco did a sh,</v>

1034
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did our song,</v>

1035
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:44.590
<v Speaker 3>our set and then he played and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage and he performed a song my mom</v>

1036
00:43:47.151 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 3>wrote called storms never last.</v>

1037
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 3>So my mom's over on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage and we were talking.</v>

1038
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 3>He and my mom are watching it and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>singing it with his wife and stuff.</v>

1039
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.250
<v Speaker 3>The next night I'm opening up for him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he goes on stage and he goes,</v>

1040
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.330
<v Speaker 3>last night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesse culture was right in the front row</v>

1041
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.980
<v Speaker 3>when I sang this song with my wife and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was crying and like I'm sitting</v>

1042
00:44:06.981 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 3>there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was here and she was not crying.</v>

1043
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:11.970
<v Speaker 3>She was standing as you called it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was not on the front row.</v>

1044
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.591
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1045
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 3>My mom just killed her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote this song,</v>

1046
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 3>storms never last teasing and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's his character.</v>

1047
00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:22.190
<v Speaker 3>That's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying here with like,</v>

1048
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm as forgiving about him lying to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>audience because that is what he's doing</v>

1049
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 3>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his.</v>

1050
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 3>I could sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1051
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take you in the back.</v>

1052
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell this audience tomorrow</v>

1053
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.101
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a liar.</v>

1054
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 3>He's a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him.</v>

1055
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do that because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Allen Coe.</v>

1056
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 3>He's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just sit it on the show,</v>

1057
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:44.270
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not much larger audience heading the</v>

1058
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.090
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions of pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying I do character,</v>

1059
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 3>but why would I do that to him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's like,</v>

1060
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like,</v>

1061
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:55.240
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Times that I met Alex,</v>

1062
00:44:55.241 --> 00:44:57.180
<v Speaker 3>the Times I've been around him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>

1063
00:44:57.181 --> 00:45:01.410
<v Speaker 3>his Gig is this and he got called out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a specific thing.</v>

1064
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it involves the lives of children and</v>

1065
00:45:03.771 --> 00:45:05.430
<v Speaker 3>everything that I understand that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1066
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not at all sympathizing for those</v>
<v Speaker 3>family or for him versus those families.</v>

1067
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.400
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that like at the moment</v>

1068
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:18.810
<v Speaker 3>everything is so hot with this and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of exhausting and it's the</v>

1069
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Internet is the reason for it.</v>

1070
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 3>And in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think that like all of the</v>

1071
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.800
<v Speaker 3>years that have come along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass amount of people that have</v>

1072
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 3>migrated to social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that the integrated</v>

1073
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 3>conversations happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that that stuff ends up on the</v>

1074
00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 3>news now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like aol chat rooms in fucking 1998 that</v>

1075
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:39.910
<v Speaker 3>shit did not end up on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were not listening to those,</v>

1076
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 3>that the best thing to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closest you could get to fucking tv</v>

1077
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 3>was to catch a Predator when you were on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that at that time.</v>

1078
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like at this point in time,</v>

1079
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.000
<v Speaker 3>people need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1080
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.950
<v Speaker 3>not those families there lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

1081
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 3>That's their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1082
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.060
<v Speaker 3>but I just feel like people need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighten up a little bit.</v>

1083
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.690
<v Speaker 3>In the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1084
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 3>I just think that the social media thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very hazardous and I think that</v>

1085
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.560
<v Speaker 3>people's faith in all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to do with,</v>

1086
00:46:09.561 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 3>with fake news and it doesn't have to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Russian bots and all this shit.</v>

1087
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.290
<v Speaker 3>I just think that like Alex Jones is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>casualty because he's always been,</v>

1088
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by it doesn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with fake news and Russian by,</v>

1089
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean that like teachers always excuses</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all the reasons why people</v>

1090
00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:26.550
<v Speaker 3>understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real,</v>

1091
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:29.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that of course fake news is</v>

1092
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:30.853
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1093
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.670
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1094
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:35.780
<v Speaker 3>there's an NPR document.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1095
00:46:35.781 --> 00:46:36.261
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1096
00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm a radio lab podcast about Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>troll farms.</v>

1097
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.630
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

1098
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people show up at work and their,</v>

1099
00:46:45.521 --> 00:46:50.521
<v Speaker 3>their basic job is to put propaganda out</v>
<v Speaker 3>on instagram and social media and</v>

1100
00:46:51.211 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 3>twitter and comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I agree on that stuff.</v>

1101
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1102
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.250
<v Speaker 3>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get out of it.</v>

1103
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you an example.</v>

1104
00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I,</v>

1105
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.550
<v Speaker 3>what I have seen of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run a bulletin board system called</v>

1106
00:47:02.551 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 3>bits sunrise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like old technology that used</v>

1107
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:07.720
<v Speaker 3>to be modems used to dial into</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore.</v>

1108
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 3>It systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell net into it.</v>

1109
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Tell net is a port port 23 is the telnet</v>
<v Speaker 3>port.</v>

1110
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Well dvrs also share port 23.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dvrs like to have yards like your,</v>

1111
00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:24.300
<v Speaker 3>your TV connected to storing your not</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1112
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.200
<v Speaker 3>not all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Will you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you record a show on a weekly basis,</v>

1114
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is an open port.</v>

1115
00:47:30.401 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not always 23 on the units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's shared with,</v>

1116
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 3>with the telnet port.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So during the election,</v>

1117
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 3>during the months up to the election and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the months after the election,</v>

1118
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I would say four months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five months leading up five months after</v>

1119
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>on my bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kind of technical when it,</v>

1120
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 3>when I'm trying to explain this to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1121
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:50.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

1122
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.380
<v Speaker 3>when you tell net into a computer you</v>
<v Speaker 3>use for mine,</v>

1123
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 3>you would tell them that end and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would give you a log in you,</v>

1124
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.460
<v Speaker 3>it has a picture this drawn and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put your name and your address or</v>

1125
00:48:03.461 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 3>your password and you log in.</v>

1126
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the five months leading up to the</v>

1127
00:48:07.681 --> 00:48:11.080
<v Speaker 3>election and the five months afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting every day,</v>

1128
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 3>probably all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 or 20 connections that were coming in</v>

1129
00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 3>and they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1130
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't say a Bot.</v>

1131
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were scripts that were trying to</v>

1132
00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:27.080
<v Speaker 3>log into dvrs and trying to log in to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1133
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.060
<v Speaker 3>like Ip cameras that you can control and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like that.</v>

1134
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 3>So I was watching for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that about a year period.</v>

1135
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 3>So let me pause you here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying that these bots,</v>

1136
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:40.870
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to control dvrs and cameras</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have on their television.</v>

1137
00:48:40.871 --> 00:48:43.870
<v Speaker 3>They were just testing and 90% of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>were coming for China.</v>

1138
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 3>10% of them are coming from maybe Russia</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other places,</v>

1139
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:49.060
<v Speaker 3>but 90% China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea,</v>

1140
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 3>because you can look at the Ip</v>
<v Speaker 3>addresses.</v>

1141
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 3>So what are they testing for the test?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All their flaws and they're trying to do</v>

1142
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:57.340
<v Speaker 3>is they would try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be looking for a Lennox</v>

1143
00:48:57.341 --> 00:48:59.380
<v Speaker 3>login,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be like um,</v>

1144
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>login again,</v>

1145
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 3>like if you were to tell net or ssh into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a device like that,</v>

1146
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that would get was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>login and usually it's root is the</v>

1147
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:10.774
<v Speaker 3>controller.</v>

1148
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:16.050
<v Speaker 3>And so they were just trying to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just just blindly mass blindly</v>

1149
00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 3>going to Ip addresses in trying to hack</v>
<v Speaker 3>into them route and then they try</v>

1150
00:49:20.951 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 3>password.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they try like this.</v>

1151
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:24.400
<v Speaker 3>They tried that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tried the black,</v>

1152
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Russian Bot thing,</v>

1153
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.810
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it was a coordinated</v>

1154
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:31.240
<v Speaker 3>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that like all during that whole</v>

1155
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:33.850
<v Speaker 3>time I was watching my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have,</v>

1156
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting real nerdy here,</v>

1157
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I have these games that</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in that people play and like once</v>

1158
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:42.730
<v Speaker 3>you get past the 13th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14th,</v>

1159
00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 3>15th node,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which essentially means like once</v>

1160
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:47.530
<v Speaker 3>there's 15 people playing at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1161
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 3>then the game stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would be having to deal with these</v>

1162
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Chinese and Russia thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian and all these,</v>

1163
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.370
<v Speaker 3>all of them just mass trying to just</v>
<v Speaker 3>break in.</v>

1164
00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 3>And it was because of the dvrs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Ip cameras,</v>

1165
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 3>like they were really literally trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hack your system to just do whatever.</v>

1166
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the purpose was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I watched it and it was,</v>

1167
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 3>it was China mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Russia was a small amount and I</v>

1168
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 3>think that all those countries all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time or have people that are constantly</v>

1169
00:50:16.211 --> 00:50:20.230
<v Speaker 3>trying to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hack and interact with these,</v>

1170
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our shit.</v>

1171
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a thing,</v>

1172
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that as well.</v>

1173
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:25.960
<v Speaker 3>There's that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>But I think all of there's that as well.</v>

1175
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.070
<v Speaker 5>But there's also people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely trying to influence</v>

1176
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 5>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're absolutely trying to influence</v>

1177
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 5>our system and that they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>manipulate political parties and they're</v>

1178
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 5>trying to start descent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is one of the things that's</v>

1179
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 5>really fascinating about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a radiolab podcast where they talk about</v>

1180
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:47.840
<v Speaker 5>how these Russian troll farms literally</v>
<v Speaker 5>set up protests.</v>

1181
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 5>They hired people to pretend to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>Donald Trump,</v>

1182
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 5>and they hired people to pretend to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>hillary and put her in a cage and have</v>

1183
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:55.520
<v Speaker 5>people chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lock her up.</v>

1184
00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:00.790
<v Speaker 5>Like this is all manufactured descent</v>
<v Speaker 5>and manufactured outrage that there</v>

1185
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.870
<v Speaker 5>they're strategically promoting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1186
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.680
<v Speaker 5>that's fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here you've got to think,</v>

1187
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 5>pause for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to think Russia is we,</v>

1188
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about a giant place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1189
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.840
<v Speaker 5>So to pretend that what's happening with</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people hacking into dvrs and web</v>

1190
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Speaker 5>cameras is all that's happening.</v>

1191
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.850
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're saying what you're exposed to</v>

1192
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:27.851
<v Speaker 5>that you witnessed as small example of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happens when people are exploiting</v>

1193
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:31.040
<v Speaker 5>vulnerabilities in systems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't mean that's the only</v>

1194
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:32.180
<v Speaker 5>thing that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1195
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you're not,</v>

1196
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 5>but I want to clarify.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things that are going</v>

1197
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:37.790
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things that are going</v>

1198
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:41.830
<v Speaker 5>on because people are dealing with these</v>
<v Speaker 5>new technologies and these cases terms</v>

1199
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.620
<v Speaker 5>and which way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1200
00:51:43.621 --> 00:51:45.810
<v Speaker 5>with the Russian hacking elections thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1201
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 5>and I don't like to get political</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't really fuck,</v>

1202
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.470
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to get political.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at it objectively looking at it</v>

1203
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 5>like a system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like look at it like this,</v>

1204
00:51:52.851 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 5>look at it like you have a body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1205
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 5>And your body has an immune system and</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body's immune system is constantly</v>

1206
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 5>under threat of all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1207
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking touch a door knob,</v>

1208
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 5>you wipe your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of shit going on.</v>

1209
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is very similar if you just looked</v>

1210
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 5>at it objectively to what happens</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you have a server on the</v>

1211
00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:14.220
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

1212
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.610
<v Speaker 5>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear about the Republican Party</v>

1213
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 5>getting hacked into or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different people's emails getting</v>

1214
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:23.050
<v Speaker 5>exploited by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1215
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.160
<v Speaker 5>someone from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a hacker.</v>

1216
00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's they're trying to find a way</v>

1217
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:29.630
<v Speaker 5>through the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just natural thing.</v>

1218
00:52:29.631 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 5>If you put up a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people go,</v>

1219
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:32.090
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do I get past that wall?</v>

1220
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you make $34,000 a year and a guy</v>

1221
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 5>makes $1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that guy know?</v>

1222
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.100
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a natural thing that happens.</v>

1223
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:43.130
<v Speaker 5>How is this any different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I guess what I'm trying to ask</v>

1224
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.350
<v Speaker 5>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like when I was watching that</v>

1225
00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 5>happen with my system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like how is this any different than</v>

1226
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:52.400
<v Speaker 5>what is going on for the last hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>years?</v>

1227
00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.660
<v Speaker 5>Cause he comes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1228
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:55.910
<v Speaker 5>Because it's new because no one has been</v>
<v Speaker 5>able to get it.</v>

1229
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:57.263
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's new.</v>

1230
00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:00.020
<v Speaker 5>No one has been able to get into your</v>
<v Speaker 5>folders before.</v>

1231
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 5>No one's been able to get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1232
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One kid sitting in Czechoslovakia who</v>

1233
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 5>has a computer has been able to figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>out how to turn your Webcam on and watch</v>

1234
00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:10.430
<v Speaker 5>it beat off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a new thing,</v>

1235
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.920
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't have a Webcam to beat off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter for,</v>

1236
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:14.240
<v Speaker 5>but you understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 5>This is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a new thing.</v>

1238
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 5>So because this is a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like for some reason,</v>

1239
00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 5>but it is human nature thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is human nature.</v>

1240
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:23.390
<v Speaker 5>But I don't understand what your point</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

1241
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess what I'm asking here is,</v>

1242
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.753
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1243
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 3>is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the way of the,</v>

1244
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like the Russian Bot thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1245
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:34.280
<v Speaker 3>was all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the Russian bots is,</v>

1246
00:53:34.281 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a term for people who don't</v>

1247
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 3>understand computers in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've,</v>

1248
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 3>they've just kind of thrown that out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there as a political device sometimes.</v>

1249
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I think that Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>

1250
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every other fucking country that is</v>

1251
00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:55.281
<v Speaker 3>enabled in a way in which they're so far</v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead technologically was involved in</v>

1252
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.660
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of fucking fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's still involved in it.</v>

1253
00:53:58.661 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 3>It will still do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>During the election it was fucking a</v>

1254
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 3>hundred times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1255
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1256
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1257
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.900
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me,</v>

1258
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back circling around to the Alex Jones</v>

1259
00:54:09.271 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this new technology,</v>

1260
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:17.181
<v Speaker 3>all of the people who are awake woke</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook on facebook.</v>

1261
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.340
<v Speaker 3>They know you're an angel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're woke on facebook.</v>

1262
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 3>So wake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1263
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt bad for fucking childish Gambino</v>

1264
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:27.060
<v Speaker 3>that he had a song that had stay woke</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1265
00:54:27.061 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 3>because immediately that song that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was what an amazing song and it was a,</v>

1266
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:34.140
<v Speaker 3>it was that that term became dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

1267
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just feel like,</v>

1268
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this that's happening,</v>

1269
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:42.150
<v Speaker 3>all of this talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the him getting banned,</v>

1270
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:47.151
<v Speaker 3>all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all this kind of like effect of the</v>

1271
00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:52.950
<v Speaker 3>world instead of being out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has,</v>

1272
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.710
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has gone to this point where it's,</v>

1273
00:54:55.711 --> 00:54:56.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these groups,</v>

1274
00:54:56.671 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 3>these really rich groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google and facebook and twitter and all</v>

1275
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:03.630
<v Speaker 3>this and everyone has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has gone to this central point and other</v>

1276
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 3>lynching people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you agree with Alex</v>

1277
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you like him,</v>

1278
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 3>whether or not I think he's being</v>
<v Speaker 3>launched in the situation right there.</v>

1279
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.830
<v Speaker 3>So I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that there's all these people that</v>

1280
00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 3>are doing all these different nefarious</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1281
00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:20.000
<v Speaker 3>This has been going on forever and now</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're using new systems to do that.</v>

1282
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.360
<v Speaker 3>They using the internet and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>open pipes and these connections that</v>

1283
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.500
<v Speaker 3>they can make trick is that the public</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there.</v>

1284
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.600
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten them to go to this a one</v>
<v Speaker 3>arena.</v>

1285
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 3>That is my problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it like as much of a nerd and a</v>

1286
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 3>technology person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

1287
00:55:32.461 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that people have instead of</v>

1288
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure they have their own</v>

1289
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:43.320
<v Speaker 3>lives but like the fact that we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>become so centralized to these small</v>

1290
00:55:43.321 --> 00:55:48.321
<v Speaker 3>groups of Internet companies like social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media and things and then now look,</v>

1291
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:53.730
<v Speaker 3>it's on both sides man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Alex Jones is getting lynched.</v>

1292
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1293
00:55:54.991 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very different things,</v>

1294
00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone is a very,</v>

1295
00:55:58.891 --> 00:55:59.461
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1296
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different than not defending him.</v>

1297
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.050
<v Speaker 3>But I understand how you made this</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>

1298
00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:07.540
<v Speaker 3>but the connection is the fast</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection as people were just attack</v>

1299
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:10.660
<v Speaker 3>the findings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The minute it look,</v>

1300
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 3>those people could have suits against</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein,</v>

1301
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Stein Steen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can know about it.</v>

1302
00:56:15.061 --> 00:56:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Of course we knew about it because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street Journal or what,</v>

1303
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.470
<v Speaker 3>whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or New York Times who were in that thing</v>

1304
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.630
<v Speaker 3>was a new yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:23.600
<v Speaker 3>The new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1306
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.270
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1307
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 5>I guess my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1308
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1309
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion,</v>

1310
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:35.491
<v Speaker 5>but I just feel like that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>centralization of society into social</v>

1311
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:41.491
<v Speaker 5>media is resulting in a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are very ugly.</v>

1312
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.160
<v Speaker 5>And I think that the Russian Bot thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Chinese hackers thing,</v>

1313
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 5>the Alex Jones issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the me too movement,</v>

1314
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:51.830
<v Speaker 5>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I,</v>

1315
00:56:51.831 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm behind all the people that,</v>

1316
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 5>that were hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

1317
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:58.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm behind the sandy hooks people on</v>
<v Speaker 5>behind the people who had the bad</v>

1318
00:56:58.031 --> 00:56:59.360
<v Speaker 5>experiences in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that.</v>

1319
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 5>What are you proposing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you saying?</v>

1320
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's unhealthy.</v>

1321
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:07.990
<v Speaker 5>I think that social media thing has</v>
<v Speaker 5>become too centralized.</v>

1322
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.740
<v Speaker 5>There needs to be decentralized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1323
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.090
<v Speaker 5>sort of centralized because there's all</v>
<v Speaker 5>your kids in groups.</v>

1324
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 5>They are instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1325
00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 5>it's 100% centralized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1326
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 5>it's owned by a group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>several groups.</v>

1327
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:21.840
<v Speaker 5>It's several,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1328
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's kind of going to Mcdonald's</v>

1329
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 5>to have these conversations as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to it being something that is a little</v>

1330
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 5>more healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just find,</v>

1331
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 5>I just think that that people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Alex Jones should have always</v>

1332
00:57:35.741 --> 00:57:39.070
<v Speaker 5>been able to be crazy in his world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was always nice to me.</v>

1333
00:57:39.071 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said he's your friend.</v>

1334
00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.490
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what the problem with Alex's,</v>

1335
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.260
<v Speaker 5>he needs someone sitting right next to</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1336
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.690
<v Speaker 5>Someone like me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who when he talks and he said</v>

1337
00:57:47.691 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 5>something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go wait a minute.</v>

1338
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you know that?</v>

1339
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we have the documents will show me</v>

1340
00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:54.010
<v Speaker 5>the documents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the documents don't say that.</v>

1341
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 5>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem is,</v>

1342
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 5>or they are definitely trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>influence.</v>

1343
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:57.941
<v Speaker 5>And he'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1344
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:00.190
<v Speaker 5>they probably are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you leave them alone,</v>

1345
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.050
<v Speaker 5>if you leave them alone and just let</v>
<v Speaker 5>them rant.</v>

1346
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's doing six hours,</v>

1347
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 5>eight hours of radio a fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's definitely likes to drink.</v>

1348
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.550
<v Speaker 5>So he's doing six hours of radio a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least three of them are drunk and</v>

1349
00:58:12.551 --> 00:58:17.020
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking fill in time and screaming</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no one can say anything to him.</v>

1350
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 5>And he's the fucking man over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's also part of the problem.</v>

1351
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 5>He's got a bunch of these other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are around them all the time and</v>

1352
00:58:22.811 --> 00:58:26.110
<v Speaker 5>there conspiracy theories as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there are 28 and you know,</v>

1353
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:28.570
<v Speaker 5>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're hanging out with Alex Jones and</v>

1354
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 5>it goes on rants and no one interrupts</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1355
00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:34.570
<v Speaker 5>It's abroad argument with all of it</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I agree.</v>

1356
00:58:34.571 --> 00:58:36.910
<v Speaker 5>But he was always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was always transmitting.</v>

1357
00:58:36.911 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 5>He was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1358
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 5>show me where the Satanists are going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>worship it took to sacrifice children.</v>

1359
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

1360
00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:46.300
<v Speaker 5>But I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what happened is now the idea is</v>

1361
00:58:46.301 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 5>that he's influencing people</v>
<v Speaker 5>politically.</v>

1362
00:58:48.281 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the whole uh,</v>

1363
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Podesta pizza gate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that all that stuff was scared the shit</v>

1364
00:58:54.551 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 5>out of people when that guy showed up at</v>
<v Speaker 5>that pizza place and fire off around and</v>

1365
00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they want up arrest them and</v>

1366
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:02.210
<v Speaker 5>they really thought there was a dungeon</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the basement where again,</v>

1367
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:06.960
<v Speaker 5>kids centralizing in social media is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause for a lot of these reactions.</v>

1368
00:59:06.961 --> 00:59:11.961
<v Speaker 5>Is that centralizing and social media or</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that people exciting people to go and</v>

1369
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:14.710
<v Speaker 5>take action against something that may</v>
<v Speaker 5>or may not even be real?</v>

1370
00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.920
<v Speaker 5>If you are you allowed to yell out fire</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a crowded theater,</v>

1371
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what ultimately the problem,</v>

1372
00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not whether or not he believes in</v>

1373
00:59:22.251 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 5>Bohemian Grove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is real and be proved it on video</v>

1374
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 5>back when they had vhs tapes and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>watched it.</v>

1375
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:33.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've known Alex since 99 or 98 I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think maybe I've known for a long ass</v>

1376
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:39.971
<v Speaker 5>time and that this is a very big</v>
<v Speaker 5>difference between then and what's</v>

1377
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:44.390
<v Speaker 5>happening now is as far as the reach and</v>
<v Speaker 5>influence and I think people are sort of</v>

1378
00:59:44.391 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 5>panicking about reach and influence and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it means and how to mitigate it,</v>

1379
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.260
<v Speaker 5>how to change people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to stop people from going into pizza</v>

1380
00:59:51.261 --> 00:59:54.140
<v Speaker 5>places and shooting them up because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>think that something that they heard</v>

1381
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:56.930
<v Speaker 5>online is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of stuff that people hear</v>

1382
00:59:56.931 --> 00:59:59.540
<v Speaker 5>online that isn't just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1383
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 5>the lizards underground or the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>earth land flat and there's a lot of</v>

1384
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 5>stuff that's just nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

1385
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to separate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what I think.</v>

1386
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.030
<v Speaker 5>I think we are going through an</v>
<v Speaker 5>adolescent stage as a,</v>

1387
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.080
<v Speaker 5>as a being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as an evolving being.</v>

1388
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:20.380
<v Speaker 5>And I think our bodies and our minds and</v>
<v Speaker 5>our consciousness are becoming</v>

1389
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 5>synchronized with technology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And along the way,</v>

1390
01:00:25.281 --> 01:00:28.310
<v Speaker 5>like right now we are in this chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 5>screaming,</v>

1391
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 5>sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crying,</v>

1392
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.740
<v Speaker 5>pissing shitting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>state of chaos.</v>

1393
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 5>And we are looking to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop the bleeding.</v>

1394
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:40.280
<v Speaker 5>We're looking to shove thumbs into</v>
<v Speaker 5>dykes,</v>

1395
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:45.610
<v Speaker 5>dykes meaning like dams and we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking to try to figure out a way to</v>

1396
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:49.250
<v Speaker 5>stop the bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to put patches and bandaids</v>

1397
01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 5>on things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to manage the chaos.</v>

1398
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:54.890
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a stage that we're going</v>

1399
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:56.690
<v Speaker 5>through because this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on a second.</v>

1400
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 5>This is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a new thing for human beings.</v>

1401
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 5>The ability to communicate widespread</v>
<v Speaker 5>over millions and millions of people</v>

1402
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 5>instantaneously is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people have say that never had say</v>

1403
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:11.480
<v Speaker 5>before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have influenced it,</v>

1404
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:12.440
<v Speaker 5>never had an influence before.</v>

1405
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.200
<v Speaker 5>They have their ability to contribute</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they might not have thought these</v>

1406
01:01:15.201 --> 01:01:19.820
<v Speaker 5>things through and these things catch</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire and they run through dry forest</v>

1407
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.180
<v Speaker 5>like a goddamn tornado of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1408
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:25.980
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of flames that you see on CNN when the</v>

1409
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Mendocino fire up in northern</v>
<v Speaker 5>California,</v>

1410
01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what happens with ideas because</v>

1411
01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 5>there's no way to contain them and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know what's right or what's wrong.</v>

1412
01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I think that what we're going through</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the period of 1994 the period of</v>

1413
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:43.130
<v Speaker 5>2018 is like a crazy fire in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a hurricane.</v>

1414
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 5>It's like everything is nuts and no one</v>
<v Speaker 5>knows how to stop it and no one knows</v>

1415
01:01:47.451 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 5>what to do and what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get together and shelters and we</v>

1416
01:01:50.871 --> 01:01:53.870
<v Speaker 5>fucking give people water and we tried</v>
<v Speaker 5>to stop the fire and take away</v>

1417
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 5>everyone's lighters and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing right now.</v>

1418
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.660
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to take away lighters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We trying to stop people who start fires</v>

1419
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:04.580
<v Speaker 5>and this is what's happening with Alex</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not that Alex is a bad guy,</v>

1420
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 5>is that he has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's by himself eras.</v>

1421
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:13.810
<v Speaker 5>It's irresponsible to say that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure a fact that these parents from</v>

1422
01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:16.520
<v Speaker 5>sandy hook or crisis actors and their</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids never died.</v>

1423
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.530
<v Speaker 5>It's irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he didn't think it was irresponsible</v>

1424
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 5>when he was doing</v>

1425
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 3>it because he's probably caught up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he does and he's caught up in the</v>

1426
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 3>wave of ad libbing just like you and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>are ad living.</v>

1427
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:29.100
<v Speaker 3>We didn't even talk about what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to talk about.</v>

1428
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turned on and where we had a couple of</v>

1429
01:02:32.641 --> 01:02:33.720
<v Speaker 3>drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1430
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying there is very red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to cut you off.</v>

1431
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:36.623
<v Speaker 3>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1432
01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 3>but what you're saying there is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart because to me,</v>

1433
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1434
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:43.590
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1435
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.310
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1436
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 3>he has always been doing this and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just point in time his reach has grown,</v>

1437
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.410
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's now there's a wind behind him.</v>

1438
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.830
<v Speaker 3>He used to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1439
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.610
<v Speaker 3>in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was raining every day and he had a</v>

1440
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:59.550
<v Speaker 3>little patch of dry newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that shit on fire and everybody go,</v>

1441
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.660
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex is crazy.</v>

1442
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:01.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1443
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1444
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.180
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1445
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I think what I'm trying to articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not doing as well as I wanted</v>

1446
01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:09.180
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think what my problem is,</v>

1447
01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:12.990
<v Speaker 3>is the synchronization of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what I'm not into.</v>

1448
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1449
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.490
<v Speaker 3>just like you have a Rut of people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that,</v>

1450
01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1451
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:26.880
<v Speaker 3>they now believe that the sandy hook</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is fake and they're calling the</v>

1452
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 3>families because of this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where that lawsuit is really</v>

1453
01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 3>coming from because the other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you also have another side of</v>

1454
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:35.981
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could be,</v>

1455
01:03:35.981 --> 01:03:39.540
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day when they said that Paul</v>

1456
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Mccartney was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they got harassed,</v>

1457
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:47.390
<v Speaker 3>but it was on such a small level because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no way to just email Paul</v>

1458
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Mccartney and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or email and say,</v>

1459
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you're not the real public mccartney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking dead.</v>

1460
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no way to exchange these ideas</v>

1461
01:03:56.950 --> 01:04:01.260
<v Speaker 3>amongst people real time on facebook all</v>
<v Speaker 3>day long,</v>

1462
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.090
<v Speaker 3>which is the centralization that creates</v>
<v Speaker 3>these rivers and in these ruts that</v>

1463
01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:09.420
<v Speaker 3>people who don't know what to do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fall into one rut or another and</v>

1464
01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:11.250
<v Speaker 3>they kind of become this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1465
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 3>this kind of streamline thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the way you just described it</v>

1466
01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:16.710
<v Speaker 3>as is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1467
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:20.670
<v Speaker 3>articulate essentially thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt is a new thing when we are in a</v>

1468
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:22.500
<v Speaker 3>really exciting time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why,</v>

1469
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 3>why I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they used to say that about the</v>

1470
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 3>printing press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to worry about that with the</v>

1471
01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:28.650
<v Speaker 3>written word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to worry about that with</v>

1472
01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The distribution of information is not,</v>

1473
01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not whether or not it's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a part of what the,</v>

1474
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 3>this being does with this being does is</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly search for innovation and</v>

1475
01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 3>novelty.</v>

1476
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the human being does.</v>

1477
01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 3>But like I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess yes,</v>

1478
01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:47.160
<v Speaker 3>but it was looking at your phone over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1479
01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:48.300

<v Speaker 3>you got to fucking iphone.</v>

1480
01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.730

<v Speaker 3>people making an iphones and go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>These mother fuckers are ready to come</v>

1487
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.220
<v Speaker 3>was invented hyperlinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea was that if someone went to</v>

1488
01:05:06.221 --> 01:05:07.290
<v Speaker 3>hog dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the time and I should know his name.</v>

1492
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.000
<v Speaker 3>It was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think you lie.</v>

1493
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.300
<v Speaker 3>So this cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this cat a,</v>

1494
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:24.130
<v Speaker 3>all he wanted to do was make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically we're like medical documents</v>

1495
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.870
<v Speaker 3>where you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you would say like,</v>

1496
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Speaker 3>you know this guy had a brain transplant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then brain transplant will be</v>

1497
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.200
<v Speaker 3>underlined and you clicked on that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would take you to a link that</v>

1498
01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:35.620
<v Speaker 3>explained brain transplants and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be worldwide.</v>

1499
01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:41.010
<v Speaker 3>So the Internet is decentralized and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>web is decentralized to some degree.</v>

1500
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Google coming in with search</v>

1501
01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:45.730
<v Speaker 3>engines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's focusing points.</v>

1502
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 3>What scares me is those people being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like facebook being the avenue in</v>

1503
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:53.770
<v Speaker 3>whichever it be talks like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should scare you is a weed I just</v>

1504
01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 3>handed you holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took two hits and I'm not even here</v>

1505
01:05:57.341 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an anti yet I am very high.</v>

1506
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a blunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's legit.</v>

1507
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.540
<v Speaker 3>It took two hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked a little bit louder.</v>

1508
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck around here in California Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean?</v>

1509
01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I just have a problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>centralization of the companies owning</v>

1510
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 3>the avenues in which get taught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I right,</v>

1511
01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right with you on that.</v>

1512
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.240
<v Speaker 3>I think we need more youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need more venues for people</v>

1513
01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 3>to distribute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distribute information.</v>

1514
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.750
<v Speaker 3>But I also think we need more love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more compassion.</v>

1515
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.060
<v Speaker 3>There's so much hate and anger towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1516
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.220
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm going to get dark nailed</v>
<v Speaker 3>here on this because I'm not,</v>

1517
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the nervousness about doing</v>

1518
01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 3>a live show right after Bush while you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking.</v>

1519
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1520
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:41.651
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not,</v>

1521
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm very nervous right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a fucking drink.</v>

1522
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.170
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say five.</v>

1523
01:06:46.171 --> 01:06:47.110
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very nervous.</v>

1524
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.360
<v Speaker 3>I would say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1525
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of those ones were there.</v>

1526
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:51.240
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1527
01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.370
<v Speaker 3>it's tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tobacco and some shit that was grown on</v>

1528
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1529
01:06:56.801 --> 01:07:01.801
<v Speaker 3>Armstrong groups we man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see I again,</v>

1530
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.260
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like there was a point when</v>

1531
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to make sense right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is part of the problem,</v>

1532
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:07.841
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1533
01:07:07.841 --> 01:07:09.550
<v Speaker 3>This is why I wanted us to get here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting,</v>

1534
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:12.400
<v Speaker 3>we're getting super serious about topics</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are very,</v>

1535
01:07:12.401 --> 01:07:15.520
<v Speaker 3>that mean a lot to people and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really know enough about it.</v>

1536
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like,</v>

1537
01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I just wish that there weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1538
01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.220
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1539
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:24.760
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's reps that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to fall in to communicate</v>

1540
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>and there and there are ruts that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>owned by these companies that,</v>

1541
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.690
<v Speaker 3>that are very fucking rich and varied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing too.</v>

1542
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 3>These companies didn't see this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm libertarian,</v>

1543
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm not either way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just in the sense I'm not really</v>

1544
01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:38.740
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even fucking know what that is.</v>

1545
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.820
<v Speaker 3>All I know is I don't believe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>trusting anybody who,</v>

1546
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.950
<v Speaker 3>who says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1547
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come this way.</v>

1548
01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Just don't worry about a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're the ones making all the</v>

1549
01:07:49.451 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1550
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:53.830
<v Speaker 3>that's how the Internet has become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be a wild west of</v>

1551
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:56.920
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emails are fucking information that is,</v>

1552
01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.280
<v Speaker 3>that's me communicating with you and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one else seeing it.</v>

1553
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the idea of twitter and</v>

1554
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:05.590
<v Speaker 3>facebook and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic when it first started,</v>

1555
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.650
<v Speaker 3>but at the this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten so big,</v>

1556
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.920
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't break up into something</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people figure out that they are in</v>

1557
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 3>control of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not these other people.</v>

1558
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what it bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1559
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 5>So what bothers you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it someone comes along and says the</v>

1560
01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 5>people aren't in control of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>

1561
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:21.950
<v Speaker 5>so it's not like a free market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The free,</v>

1562
01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:23.003
<v Speaker 5>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

1563
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 5>It was a free market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a free market.</v>

1564
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 5>A guy like Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd say this guy is preposterous.</v>

1565
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:31.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm not listening to him anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it's not a free market is when</v>

1566
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 5>youtube collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1567
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.300
<v Speaker 5>I dunno if they collaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they just all agree.</v>

1568
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they just all decide everyone's</v>

1569
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 5>going to take them off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Facebook's gonna suspend him for 30</v>

1570
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twitter's going to suspend it for a</v>

1571
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 5>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Youtube is going to remove them.</v>

1572
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 5>All these people are going to take vimeo</v>
<v Speaker 5>jumped on ship and they pulled them off</v>

1573
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:48.110
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this,</v>

1574
01:08:48.111 --> 01:08:53.111
<v Speaker 5>this becomes an issue like what is it</v>
<v Speaker 5>that causes you to get removed?</v>

1575
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 5>What is it and should we be really clear</v>
<v Speaker 5>on that or is this just a whim because</v>

1576
01:08:58.161 --> 01:09:01.310
<v Speaker 5>this is a really important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we really are fucking with free</v>

1577
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:04.490
<v Speaker 5>speech we have to be very careful on</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we decide.</v>

1578
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Is is a valid reason to pull people off</v>
<v Speaker 5>of our airways?</v>

1579
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.930
<v Speaker 5>Because if you have stuff on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>airways that's far more vile and you let</v>

1580
01:09:14.931 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 5>that stay up because it doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same reach,</v>

1581
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:20.810
<v Speaker 5>like what is your criteria?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have the same influence.</v>

1582
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.270
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have the same political ties</v>
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>

1583
01:09:23.271 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the reason why you're pulling</v>

1584
01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:29.420
<v Speaker 5>one thing off and not another thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it because of the popularity issue?</v>

1585
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:34.660
<v Speaker 5>Have you searched your trillions of</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking hours of footage for offensive</v>

1586
01:09:35.391 --> 01:09:37.250
<v Speaker 5>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>content,</v>

1587
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:40.940
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disinformation,</v>

1588
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.000
<v Speaker 5>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what have you really done to mitigate</v>

1589
01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:49.001
<v Speaker 5>this issue or are you acting on this</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a social hotspot issue</v>

1590
01:09:49.761 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which it most certainly is and most</v>

1591
01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 5>certainly should be.</v>

1592
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.820
<v Speaker 5>I really think that Alex needs a guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>right next to him.</v>

1593
01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 5>He really like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand this and I did a show</v>

1594
01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 5>together and Howard Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1595
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.200
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the same comparison.</v>

1596
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 5>I guess Howard's but listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's do him every day.</v>

1597
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:07.880
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes I want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1598
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:10.790
<v Speaker 5>are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's also part of his charm,</v>

1599
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.180
<v Speaker 5>part of his charm and she creates</v>
<v Speaker 5>descent in arguments and you want to get</v>

1600
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:17.060
<v Speaker 5>mad and you want to either he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>opinionated well,</v>

1601
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.760
<v Speaker 5>but how it's turns very responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a different guy.</v>

1602
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.320
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the same thing.</v>

1603
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to compare Alex to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying that sometimes I feel</v>

1634
01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:41.620
<v Speaker 5>this topic could be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know we're not,</v>

1635
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 5>we're not qualified to have this</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation,</v>

1636
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:45.220
<v Speaker 5>but no one is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.160
<v Speaker 5>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as we're honest about how we</v>

1638
01:11:47.161 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 5>feel about things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 5>They were a little off.</v>

1641
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe in protecting children's</v>

1642
01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.390
<v Speaker 5>innocence in a certain way that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with youtube not allowing porn</v>

1643
01:11:57.391 --> 01:11:58.171
<v Speaker 5>and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1644
01:11:58.171 --> 01:12:01.440
<v Speaker 5>because like my kids look at youtube all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>

1645
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.470
<v Speaker 5>but what about twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter or loss?</v>

1646
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.090
<v Speaker 5>A certain amount of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes we flipping through my time,</v>

1647
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 5>my phone down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta go Yo Kendra la slow at town.</v>

1648
01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nice call out.</v>

1649
01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:13.951
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1650
01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:15.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it may as well have like,</v>

1651
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:20.270
<v Speaker 5>I believe if Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if Alex Jones and if the unboxing of the</v>

1652
01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.880
<v Speaker 5>Lolz can exist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

1653
01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.240
<v Speaker 5>Like oils,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my daughter,</v>

1654
01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:28.080
<v Speaker 5>these toys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lls,</v>

1655
01:12:28.081 --> 01:12:31.770
<v Speaker 5>shopkins and things like that where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>show videos of them are the slime videos</v>

1656
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:34.980
<v Speaker 5>of doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like youtube and those kinds of things.</v>

1657
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.670
<v Speaker 5>I just think that there is a certain</v>
<v Speaker 5>level of like,</v>

1658
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.500
<v Speaker 5>just ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't like it.</v>

1659
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 5>Well it's not your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lawsuit thing.</v>

1660
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.440
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's out of this context a little bit.</v>

1661
01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 5>He went too far with that big difference</v>
<v Speaker 5>between something that you might find</v>

1662
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 5>gross and something that changes</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>

1663
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:56.220
<v Speaker 5>I think what they're worried about is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you remember when Jim Acosta did</v>

1664
01:12:56.221 --> 01:12:56.820
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1665
01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.070
<v Speaker 5>he went to that trump rally and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>went crazy on him.</v>

1666
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.653
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that shit?</v>

1667
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a recent thing?</v>

1668
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:07.110
<v Speaker 5>Weeks ago?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is CNN anchor who is reasonably</v>

1669
01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:10.380
<v Speaker 5>self righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's in a difficult situation.</v>

1670
01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.900
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has to challenge the president of the</v>

1671
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 5>United States who is also a famous</v>
<v Speaker 5>celebrity billionaire guy.</v>

1672
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:20.370
<v Speaker 5>What's his name on buildings?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this literally is Rosebud.</v>

1673
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the tale of citizen Kane.</v>

1674
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is someone with an ungodly power</v>

1675
01:13:28.531 --> 01:13:31.890
<v Speaker 5>and influence and this gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not standing up for Jim Acosta.</v>

1676
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just put yourself in that guy's</v>

1677
01:13:34.471 --> 01:13:36.450
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Questions at the president of United</v>

1679
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.980
<v Speaker 5>States who also happens to be Donald</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trump.</v>

1680
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:45.981
<v Speaker 5>You think like you're on acid the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The world has gone into a vortex of</v>

1681
01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 5>crazy and you're the guy by some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>freak of chance,</v>

1682
01:13:51.211 --> 01:13:54.180
<v Speaker 5>whether you're Jim Acosta or don lemon</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

1683
01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.630
<v Speaker 5>or fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone up,</v>

1684
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 5>it went off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You heard it,</v>

1685
01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.550
<v Speaker 5>he hit the button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I accidentally hit the button to do this</v>

1686
01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 5>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it mean if you're one of those</v>

1687
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:09.000
<v Speaker 5>fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hold this picture.</v>

1688
01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:10.800
<v Speaker 5>It was the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

1689
01:14:10.801 --> 01:14:11.634
<v Speaker 5>I've got to that off</v>

1690
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 1>for a few seconds ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those fucking people</v>

1691
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we expect them to handle that.</v>

1692
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>That's probably like being beyonce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock on steroids,</v>

1693
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1694
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:29.410
<v Speaker 1>but in a negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be those two because those</v>

1695
01:14:29.411 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 1>are like very beloved celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like very few people are as beloved as</v>

1696
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:37.160
<v Speaker 1>the rock or beyonce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty much universally beloved,</v>

1697
01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the person uniquely so they're so loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so deserving of that love.</v>

1698
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a guy like who's a like a</v>

1699
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:48.220

<v Speaker 3>music is like,</v>

1713
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all different man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>put the o back in country.</v>

1715

<v Speaker 3>You got to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got that,</v>

1716
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:43.190

<v Speaker 3>This is like a bad ass country album,</v>

1717
01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.740
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like with this twist,</v>

1718
01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 3>like a respectful country album that</v>
<v Speaker 3>also has a lot of like modern wickedness</v>

1719
01:15:51.351 --> 01:15:52.580
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1720
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.400
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that was the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when we were,</v>

1721
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.780
<v Speaker 3>when we were doing the first record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was me and Ted Wrestle camp.</v>

1722
01:15:59.781 --> 01:16:02.900
<v Speaker 3>He still plays with me and Leroy pal who</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't play with me anymore,</v>

1723
01:16:02.901 --> 01:16:04.520
<v Speaker 3>but he played on that record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He played guitar.</v>

1724
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Brian Kaylin was a drummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started doing our shit.</v>

1725
01:16:07.281 --> 01:16:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Like our idea was we were living here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1726
01:16:09.981 --> 01:16:12.800
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had 2003 we started recording the</v>

1727
01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:16.070
<v Speaker 3>first record and I had met her three</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and we were like,</v>

1728
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.520
<v Speaker 3>our whole thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we like rock music because it sounds</v>

1729
01:16:19.521 --> 01:16:20.150
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

1730
01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:22.100
<v Speaker 3>And we like Dylan and we like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1731
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:23.840
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even smart enough to like Dylan</v>

1732
01:16:23.841 --> 01:16:26.240
<v Speaker 3>then we were like into fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1733
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:31.010
<v Speaker 3>Bowie and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't came for the nine inch nails</v>

1734
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:32.870
<v Speaker 3>side get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I got into music.</v>

1735
01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.430
<v Speaker 3>We kind of talked about that near the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1736
01:16:34.431 --> 01:16:35.510
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1737
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:40.160
<v Speaker 3>like by that time the idea was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we make country music?</v>

1738
01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:44.000
<v Speaker 3>We like the old stuff but have it sound</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool and why can't we bring in like the</v>

1739
01:16:44.001 --> 01:16:48.200
<v Speaker 3>stuff that raw that's cool about rock</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why can't you go psychedelic and why</v>

1740
01:16:48.201 --> 01:16:51.320
<v Speaker 3>can't you kind of push the limits that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1741
01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:54.530
<v Speaker 3>And we were just dumb and trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it that way.</v>

1742
01:16:54.531 --> 01:16:56.510
<v Speaker 3>And Dave Cobb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who produced this record,</v>

1743
01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.510
<v Speaker 3>we met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we met that back then and he produced</v>

1744
01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:02.000
<v Speaker 3>the first record and he was the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1745
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.870
<v Speaker 3>We were like more Beatles stones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bowie kids musically in the,</v>

1746
01:17:06.871 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 3>in the amount of records we listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1747
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.960
<v Speaker 3>obsessed over pink floyd and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1748
01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 3>then we were a country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were kind of trying to blend those</v>

1749
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:17.630
<v Speaker 3>two back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1750
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:18.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were just,</v>

1751
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 3>just trying and starting and doing weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1752
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>And then after a while just evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1753
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the album would be totally</v>

1754
01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:30.860
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't give a fuck dude.</v>

1755
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.670
<v Speaker 3>It's about the guy who invested in apple</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the eighties</v>

1756
01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just do your music,</v>

1757
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.950
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do your music and whatever you're</v>

1758
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 3>into right now is like what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting,</v>

1759
01:17:44.391 --> 01:17:44.830
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1760
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

1761
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've listened to,</v>

1762
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I've listened to every one of your cds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's only a few of them that are</v>

1763
01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:52.280
<v Speaker 3>even similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1764
01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:53.360
<v Speaker 3>similar to each other.</v>

1765
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.580
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all,</v>

1766
01:17:54.581 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 3>all your albums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you can say albums again.</v>

1767
01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:01.160
<v Speaker 3>These two cause became cd for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But who the fuck gets a CD old man.</v>

1768
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say online playlist.</v>

1769
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 3>You newest online playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1770
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 3>what do I say about your newest stems?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our playlist man.</v>

1771
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Audio release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

1772
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1773
01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:15.230
<v Speaker 3>You know what's black ribbons happen</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1774
01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:20.231
<v Speaker 3>I did the first record and that was kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my take on country and our take as a</v>

1775
01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 3>band and Dave cobb and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before that record came out,</v>

1776
01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.840
<v Speaker 3>we started recording the second record</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1777
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.810
<v Speaker 3>the first song I wrote was a song</v>
<v Speaker 3>electric Rodeo.</v>

1778
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.830
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1779
01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to go heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to like,</v>

1780
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:38.890
<v Speaker 3>just really show up and like do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of hard rocky sounding.</v>

1781
01:18:39.591 --> 01:18:40.970
<v Speaker 3>And what I mean by that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1782
01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 3>fucking we're into Zeplin and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nineties music.</v>

1783
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1784
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:47.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies ship.</v>

1785
01:18:47.251 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 3>But it was like hard rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy effects.</v>

1786
01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Immigrants saw kind of going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with the song,</v>

1787
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:56.690
<v Speaker 3>the country songs there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always felt if electric rodeo got</v>

1788
01:18:56.691 --> 01:19:00.590
<v Speaker 3>considered a country record when it came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and charted than I felt we,</v>

1789
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:04.700
<v Speaker 3>like we had done our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it did come out and it did chart.</v>

1790
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:09.050
<v Speaker 3>But once we came out with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had universal who had been behind us</v>

1791
01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 3>and they had basically been the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that worked at universal had</v>

1792
01:19:12.801 --> 01:19:17.801
<v Speaker 3>been kind of in my opinion and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion duped because Tony Brown and Tim</v>

1793
01:19:20.361 --> 01:19:23.810
<v Speaker 3>to Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who believed in me and we had done this</v>

1794
01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:28.370
<v Speaker 3>record without a deal and I sent it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony Brown cause I knew I just as a kid</v>

1795
01:19:28.371 --> 01:19:32.090
<v Speaker 3>had met him and him and my dad had done</v>
<v Speaker 3>business and I liked him and there was,</v>

1796
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:35.240
<v Speaker 3>he had made me feel like he liked me.</v>

1797
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 3>So I sent him this record after me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the band.</v>

1798
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And Dave did the record and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believed in me and they signed it</v>

1799
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 3>and he kind of like remixed our first</v>
<v Speaker 3>song so they would play it on radio.</v>

1800
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.400
<v Speaker 3>And Tony was a big producer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still is.</v>

1801
01:19:49.401 --> 01:19:53.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean he produced the first bunch Steve</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earle records and he played piano for</v>

1802
01:19:53.631 --> 01:19:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he and he was our label heads,</v>

1803
01:19:55.871 --> 01:19:57.830
<v Speaker 3>so he kinda remixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we get on radio.</v>

1804
01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:02.390
<v Speaker 3>So I'm thinking they like me cause we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have like kind of a 20 number 24 yet.</v>

1805
01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.250
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to hit him with some good shit</v>

1806
01:20:04.251 --> 01:20:06.180
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I hit him with what I thought</v>

1807
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>was a good shit and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is</v>

1808
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.660
<v Speaker 5>not what we signed up for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are out,</v>

1809
01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:11.790
<v Speaker 5>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I never got played on radio again.</v>

1810
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.713
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1811
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 5>that's all stuff that's on them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1812
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.470
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the reason why your music is so</v>

1813
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.470
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just good.</v>

1814
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like a lot of great music and your</v>

1815
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:24.030
<v Speaker 5>music is great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also that you,</v>

1816
01:20:24.031 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 5>you're clearly coming at this from an</v>
<v Speaker 5>artist perspective.</v>

1817
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 5>You're not a marketing genius by any</v>
<v Speaker 5>stretch of the imagination,</v>

1818
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.090
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your Dad's fucking waylon jennings dude.</v>

1819
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean you have the end of all ends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dad is like a super legend,</v>

1820
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these are super,</v>

1821
01:20:39.931 --> 01:20:43.440
<v Speaker 5>super legend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you choose to legitimately carve</v>

1822
01:20:43.441 --> 01:20:45.450
<v Speaker 5>your own path in this the wildest of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>

1823
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting how you do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that thoughtfulness that</v>

1824
01:20:49.441 --> 01:20:52.680
<v Speaker 5>allows you to be free like that is also</v>
<v Speaker 5>what allows you to explore these like</v>

1825
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.520
<v Speaker 5>complex issues like censorship or bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>coin or any of these things that are</v>

1826
01:20:56.521 --> 01:20:57.031
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

1827
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 5>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is some heavy stuff.</v>

1828
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.060
<v Speaker 5>Like you've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1829
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:03.210
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a you of a curious approach to</v>

1830
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 5>these things and in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a an ability to express who you</v>

1831
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 5>really are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1832
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Which is what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what comes out in your music.</v>

1833
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 5>It's not like your image,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just doing what you really feel</v>

1834
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:16.890
<v Speaker 5>when you're writing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That I think that's a,</v>

1835
01:21:16.891 --> 01:21:20.910
<v Speaker 5>that's a big part of a community that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big part of being a person.</v>

1836
01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:23.430
<v Speaker 5>Like let some person uniquely be</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

1837
01:21:23.431 --> 01:21:26.130
<v Speaker 5>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the real issue with</v>

1838
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:31.110
<v Speaker 5>social media as people are so terrified</v>
<v Speaker 5>of expressing themselves because they're</v>

1839
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.170
<v Speaker 5>terrified of the hate they get back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then they get addicted to attacking</v>

1840
01:21:34.171 --> 01:21:37.470
<v Speaker 5>other people that are failing or other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are making mistakes.</v>

1841
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.410
<v Speaker 5>And that I get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this again goes with this whole</v>

1842
01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:42.600
<v Speaker 5>fucking chaos thing that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about before.</v>

1843
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think we're in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>storm right now and I think that your,</v>

1844
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:50.250
<v Speaker 5>your take on Alex Jones and Bill Maher's</v>
<v Speaker 5>take on Alex Jones and what we're saying</v>

1845
01:21:50.251 --> 01:21:51.720
<v Speaker 5>here about them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't,</v>

1846
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:56.370
<v Speaker 5>it like it doesn't in any way negate</v>
<v Speaker 5>arguments that you shouldn't say some of</v>

1847
01:21:56.371 --> 01:21:58.620
<v Speaker 5>the things he's saying we agree with</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1848
01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 5>But we also say human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to figure this out together.</v>

1849
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:07.610
<v Speaker 5>And if you start conflict and one great</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to start conflict is to ban and to</v>

1850
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:12.060
<v Speaker 5>take people down popio call people in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazi that aren't really a Nazi,</v>

1851
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.480
<v Speaker 5>like decide that someone's an outright</v>
<v Speaker 5>white supremacists when they're really</v>

1852
01:22:15.481 --> 01:22:17.370
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are liberal and a Democrat and you</v>

1853
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:19.410
<v Speaker 5>know they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying crazy things you could to</v>

1854
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:21.510
<v Speaker 5>try to demonize people and slot them</v>
<v Speaker 5>into groups.</v>

1855
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 5>We have to reject that with every fiber</v>
<v Speaker 5>of our being because this is tyranny.</v>

1856
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.280
<v Speaker 5>This is the type of group tyranny that</v>
<v Speaker 5>although it's not connected to a network</v>

1857
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.930
<v Speaker 5>like the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1858
01:22:33.931 --> 01:22:37.350
<v Speaker 5>the KKK or the Democrats or the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Republicans,</v>

1859
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.400
<v Speaker 5>it's still this chaotic group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think thing that happens.</v>

1860
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.880
<v Speaker 5>What we decided to go after people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop being compassionate,</v>

1861
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:48.450
<v Speaker 5>stop being just a human being who</v>
<v Speaker 5>recognizes that other human beings are</v>

1862
01:22:48.451 --> 01:22:51.480
<v Speaker 5>flawed and they make mistakes and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>do stupid shit,</v>

1863
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.950
<v Speaker 5>but as soon as you oppose them so</v>
<v Speaker 5>vehemently for something that really</v>

1864
01:22:55.951 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 5>should be treated with curiosity and</v>
<v Speaker 5>compassion and maybe a little bit of</v>

1865
01:23:00.001 --> 01:23:04.650
<v Speaker 5>understanding and mockery instead of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's this anger and this vitriol</v>

1866
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:08.200
<v Speaker 5>that we just have to put a curb on</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty thinking.</v>

1867
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like new Roman Colosseum,</v>

1868
01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 5>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is in a way,</v>

1869
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fighting each court,</v>

1870
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:17.620
<v Speaker 5>cheering it on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The court of public discourse is massive</v>

1871
01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:18.190
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1872
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 5>It just opened up a gate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a little trickle.</v>

1873
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:23.470
<v Speaker 5>It was like that fucking border patrol</v>
<v Speaker 5>station in Mexico.</v>

1874
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:25.180
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to get in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

1875
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 5>If you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be that guy or risks his life in the</v>

1876
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:30.490
<v Speaker 5>middle of August and take your family</v>
<v Speaker 5>through the fucking desert with a couple</v>

1877
01:23:30.491 --> 01:23:33.550
<v Speaker 5>of jugs of water and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>walk and hope you find a job.</v>

1878
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it used to be like,</v>

1879
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like is the walls came down and</v>

1880
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:41.680
<v Speaker 5>they changed the law and everybody said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go ahead in.</v>

1881
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.920
<v Speaker 5>And everybody's in Wa and the end and</v>
<v Speaker 5>down to people going down to up and</v>

1882
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:48.700
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just opening it up.</v>

1883
01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 5>It's getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1884
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:53.200
<v Speaker 5>this is what everybody's afraid of and</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what,</v>

1885
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:55.690
<v Speaker 5>this is what's happening right now with</v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

1886
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.970
<v Speaker 5>This is what's happening for the very</v>
<v Speaker 5>first time ever,</v>

1887
01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:03.080
<v Speaker 5>but between this period of 1994 and 2018</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been this inevitable change in the</v>

1888
01:24:04.601 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 5>way people are able to express</v>
<v Speaker 5>information and who gets to express</v>

1889
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:09.124
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

1890
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll question the legitimacy of</v>

1891
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:15.610
<v Speaker 5>someone who becomes famous to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet but not famous through NBC.</v>

1892
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:18.400
<v Speaker 5>He made it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's on NBC.</v>

1893
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy is just talking to his Webcam.</v>

1894
01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 5>He has 30 times as many people paying</v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to him.</v>

1895
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 5>Why is he wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is the incorrect?</v>

1896
01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Because he didn't go through your</v>
<v Speaker 5>established channels that have existed</v>

1897
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 5>with WHO's your gatekeepers?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh guys like Harvey Weinstein.</v>

1898
01:24:33.131 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 5>Where your gatekeepers bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the fuck outta here.</v>

1899
01:24:36.431 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 5>You don't get to dictate what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting or what's creative or what</v>

1900
01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:42.940
<v Speaker 5>sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of music people like.</v>

1901
01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:46.780
<v Speaker 5>It used to be that if you like rock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't like country when I was a</v>

1902
01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 5>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are a loser if you like kiss,</v>

1903
01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 5>right dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1904
01:24:50.321 --> 01:24:52.640
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would get like categorize.</v>

1905
01:24:52.641 --> 01:24:55.810
<v Speaker 5>I had to hide some music that I liked</v>
<v Speaker 5>and kiss was one of them.</v>

1906
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.270
<v Speaker 5>I told,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told Paul,</v>

1907
01:24:58.271 --> 01:25:02.680
<v Speaker 5>Stanley didn't seem to appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told Gene Simmons ones too.</v>

1908
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:03.341
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1909
01:25:03.341 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was true.</v>

1910
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 5>I was loyal back when it was uncool to</v>
<v Speaker 5>like kiss and then it turned around and</v>

1911
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:12.160
<v Speaker 5>became super lawyer of Eddie Bravo has</v>
<v Speaker 5>to save story.</v>

1912
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.160
<v Speaker 5>We both were like embarrassed to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>kissed fans,</v>

1913
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:17.680
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I fucking love kiss.</v>

1914
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.610
<v Speaker 5>I love kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1915

1917
01:25:24.371 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 5>I love listening to all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 5>different shit.</v>

1918
01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't connect mutually exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like for me,</v>

1919
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:32.980
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up with my dad and had country</v>

1920
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 5>came along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like once I started living life and I</v>

1921

1922
01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1923

<v Speaker 5>understanding the words and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shell wrote that Shell's like the</v>

<v Speaker 3>forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy that brought like the New</v>

1962
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.370
<v Speaker 3>York sense of humor and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really cultured writing style,</v>

1963
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.210
<v Speaker 3>like the kind of hunters Thompson world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the link between that and country</v>

1964
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:22.040
<v Speaker 3>music for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shel Silverstein,</v>

1965
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I got to be around him a couple times</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was young.</v>

1966
01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.890
<v Speaker 3>He wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He though cash wrote the signature song</v>

1967
01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:29.910
<v Speaker 3>man in black.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Social conscience behind his wardrobe</v>
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>

1969
01:27:32.571 --> 01:27:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Just so we're reminded of the ones who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are held back.</v>

1970
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.970
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took to black simply because it was</v>

1971
01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:41.230
<v Speaker 3>easier to keep clean on long tours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.280
<v Speaker 4>And under the next forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

2060
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:32.010
<v Speaker 4>I bought for billions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about you go back to me in a single</v>

2061
01:31:32.011 --> 01:31:33.750
<v Speaker 4>cell organism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start from scratch,</v>

2062
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:37.140
<v Speaker 4>go through and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way you did it.</v>

2063
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.110
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what matters is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

2064
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:45.350
<v Speaker 4>And that's an impossible concept to</v>
<v Speaker 4>grasp for people who collect stamps and</v>

2065
01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.270
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your whole it up in your house because</v>

2066
01:31:48.271 --> 01:31:52.080
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to put like some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rigidity to this.</v>

2067
01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it theory of world that we live in,</v>

2068
01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:58.010
<v Speaker 4>you try to put some structure to this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't,</v>

2069
01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 4>he forgets to enjoy it and I</v>

2070
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.090
<v Speaker 1>think that is part of the point or</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier too is it's just like,</v>

2071
01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

2072
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it gets wrapped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said you were talking about when you</v>

2073
01:32:08.561 --> 01:32:10.450
<v Speaker 1>were just afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were talking about it.</v>

2074
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets sucked up into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different,</v>

2075
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:19.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking confrontations all the time and</v>

2076
01:32:19.991 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it takes all of your attention.</v>

2077
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the reason that alums</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't listened to like they used to be</v>

2078
01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:29.260
<v Speaker 1>because we used to have so much time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2079
01:32:29.261 --> 01:32:31.540
<v Speaker 1>he used to sit in your room and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you had.</v>

2080
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And now there's this constant focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a way,</v>

2081
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think the only answer is there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to be some established</v>

2082
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:44.260
<v Speaker 1>decentralization of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the returns it to the form in which all</v>

2083
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:47.350
<v Speaker 1>can exist digitally as they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

2084
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:48.520
<v Speaker 1>just like we do now.</v>

2085
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to have to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this design.</v>

2086
01:32:51.851 --> 01:32:52.661
<v Speaker 1>It's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2087
01:32:52.661 --> 01:32:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone's going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop it.</v>

2088
01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:55.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reg,</v>

2089
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's interesting is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people at the very top of the</v>

2090
01:32:58.781 --> 01:33:00.180
<v Speaker 1>heap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2091
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:04.270
<v Speaker 1>we always thought were the proponents of</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

2092
01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:05.910
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always thought that the,</v>

2093
01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the repressive people where the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing conservative people that wanted to</v>

2094
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 1>stop progress and stop nudity and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot and you know,</v>

2095
01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:18.160
<v Speaker 1>and Tipper Gore wants a bad rap music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember all that.</v>

2096
01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:21.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what we always thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually Tipper Gore was Democrats.</v>

2097
01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:24.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a very bad analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tipper Gore was Al Gore's wife Tipper</v>

2098
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Gore put this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had to speak.</v>

2099
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:27.400
<v Speaker 1>She had the stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stickers.</v>

2100
01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explicitly or not some fucking old</v>

2101
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 1>school ice tea and blew her wig.</v>

2102
01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:39.660
<v Speaker 1>But we always that that's a bad example</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she wasn't democratic it sample,</v>

2103
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.900
<v Speaker 1>but it is an example of like forget</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Democrats or Republicans.</v>

2104
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.690
<v Speaker 1>It's basically people in power trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control other folks.</v>

2105
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:47.651
<v Speaker 1>This would be this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2106
01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:49.420
<v Speaker 1>this has been going on forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2107
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:52.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we always thought of it as being the</v>

2108
01:33:52.031 --> 01:33:54.220
<v Speaker 1>conservative ones that were like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

2109
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.630
<v Speaker 1>the the most into suppression of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

2110
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop people you're swearing stopped the</v>

2111
01:34:01.151 --> 01:34:03.640
<v Speaker 1>knew that he stopped the pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always thought of as being a</v>

2112
01:34:03.641 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 1>conservative thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would argue like today it's almost</v>

2113
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:11.641
<v Speaker 1>like your behavior is more restricted on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left than it is even on the right.</v>

2114
01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:15.670
<v Speaker 1>The right is seemed to be more relaxed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like what they're willing to</v>

2115
01:34:15.671 --> 01:34:18.580
<v Speaker 1>let people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the left is like putting up all</v>

2116
01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:22.410
<v Speaker 1>these boundaries for like what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can and can't say doing.</v>

2117
01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Tom sent me this,</v>

2118
01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:25.910
<v Speaker 1>a Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura sent me this um,</v>

2119
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 1>photograph of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a sketch comedy group where</v>

2120
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:34.090
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to figure out what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can and can't do today and like what,</v>

2121
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:38.710
<v Speaker 1>what is okay to do in a sketch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a lot of it was about gay</v>

2122
01:34:38.711 --> 01:34:42.760
<v Speaker 1>people and Trans People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And can you be a Wa a straight CIS man</v>

2123
01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 1>playing a trans person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all caps?</v>

2124
01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you be assist purse or can you be a</v>

2125
01:34:48.401 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 1>trans person playing a CIS person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2126
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>All caps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do whatever you want.</v>

2127
01:34:54.851 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're a trans person who's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can play</v>

2128
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.250
<v Speaker 5>a man and that's totally cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're a shooter jennings and you</v>

2129
01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:02.084
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what man,</v>

2130
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:04.880
<v Speaker 5>I just think it would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do a movie where I play a chick.</v>

2131
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.880
<v Speaker 5>No chance buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not allowed to make believe in</v>

2132
01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't make believe in a certain way.</v>

2133
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:14.510
<v Speaker 5>They're basically saying your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your thoughts are not allowed to go down</v>

2134
01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:16.730
<v Speaker 5>these roads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no way you could manage this</v>

2135
01:35:16.731 --> 01:35:21.731
<v Speaker 5>respectfully and with with enough</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are crazy.</v>

2136
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:26.240
<v Speaker 5>But this is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people exist and they're on the</v>

2137
01:35:26.241 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 5>left now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like super inclusive,</v>

2138
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:31.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super worried about diversity,</v>

2139
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.660
<v Speaker 5>super worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2140
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.630
<v Speaker 5>people of color and there's all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>like gain weird words thrown around game</v>

2141
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 5>words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish George Carlin was alive.</v>

2142
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.140
<v Speaker 5>He would have a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2143
01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.920
<v Speaker 5>I just want to tell him again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd bring them back to life.</v>

2144
01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:49.130
<v Speaker 5>Tell him again with a hard day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would say what's similar to what</v>

2145
01:35:49.131 --> 01:35:50.210
<v Speaker 5>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying?</v>

2146
01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but probably better.</v>

2147
01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.110
<v Speaker 5>He would just tell he'd be so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2148
01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:56.630
<v Speaker 5>I just want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it would die to know what he</v>

2149
01:35:56.631 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 5>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

2150
01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:01.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to use the title of my tour.</v>

2151
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:05.450
<v Speaker 5>These are strange times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>legitimately strange times stranger than</v>

2152
01:36:05.451 --> 01:36:07.280
<v Speaker 5>we've ever experienced before as a human</v>
<v Speaker 5>race.</v>

2153
01:36:07.281 --> 01:36:08.200
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2154
01:36:08.201 --> 01:36:08.841
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

2155
01:36:08.841 --> 01:36:09.830
<v Speaker 5>I think we're on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2156
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:12.920
<v Speaker 5>beginning of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the fucked up thing is I think</v>

2157
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:15.860
<v Speaker 5>that like the Cha,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Internet is the thing,</v>

2158
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 5>the Lynch pin that change society in</v>
<v Speaker 5>such a way,</v>

2159
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.730
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the adolescent phase is what dorm do</v>

2160
01:36:21.731 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 5>these dorm of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a God damn hailstorm.</v>

2161
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:28.640
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen those hail storms when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hit those Ohio backyards and fuck</v>

2162
01:36:28.641 --> 01:36:32.510
<v Speaker 5>up the pool and everybody's in Scott</v>
<v Speaker 5>screaming and you're hearing the house,</v>

2163
01:36:32.511 --> 01:36:34.130
<v Speaker 5>like it's getting attacked by rocks.</v>

2164
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:36.860
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those hail storms of</v>

2165
01:36:36.861 --> 01:36:38.810
<v Speaker 5>information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2166
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:39.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2167

<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

2168
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we just gotta be nice to each other.</v>

2169
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:46.250
<v Speaker 5>We're all together in this thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2170
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.720
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2178
01:37:03.891 --> 01:37:06.410
<v Speaker 5>thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone has to be so much that it has to</v>

2179
01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:08.960
<v Speaker 5>be thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not with this idea that you're going to</v>

2180

<v Speaker 5>live forever because a lot of like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way we behave,</v>

2181
01:37:11.151 --> 01:37:14.810
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like we think we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>live forever instead of having the short</v>

2182
01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:17.680
<v Speaker 5>trip where you're just like kind of be</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should projected you should project</v>

2185
01:37:23.931 --> 01:37:25.610
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should all get that idea out there so</v>

2186
01:37:25.611 --> 01:37:26.800
<v Speaker 5>that we all agree like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we could do this.</v>

2189
01:37:29.361 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 5>Like even competition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to be that kind of</v>

2190
01:37:32.091 --> 01:37:35.120
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if your neighboring businesses,</v>

2191
01:37:35.121 --> 01:37:37.160
<v Speaker 5>you can be friends and everybody will do</v>
<v Speaker 5>well together.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2193
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:43.190
<v Speaker 5>this is not a time we have to control</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything and everyone and nor should</v>

2194
01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:46.470
<v Speaker 5>you want to.</v>

2195
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:50.420
<v Speaker 5>life is just one piece of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to describe it,</v>

2196
01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:52.130
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have their own summer camp</v>

<v Speaker 5>these counselors ain't controlling</v>

2200
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.600
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are finger banging each other out</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can't let a bunch of 14 year olds</v>

2203
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:07.170
<v Speaker 1>run around the forums together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck every four years.</v>

2204
01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.680
<v Speaker 1>The head counselor changes some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like last time I was like,</v>

2205
01:38:10.681 --> 01:38:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love that guy and this guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2207
01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.360
<v Speaker 1>nobody from the other neighbor camps are</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>

2208
01:38:15.361 --> 01:38:16.194
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2209
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 1>We vaguely knew when I was in boy</v>
<v Speaker 1>scouts,</v>

2210
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:23.520
<v Speaker 1>we vaguely knew that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential that one of these camp</v>

2211
01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 1>counselors might molest you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people knew.</v>

2212
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't know about him with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever did.</v>

2213
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 1>But there was that thought when we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2214
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was 13 or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was in the boy scouts.</v>

2215
01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 1>There was that thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2216
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:41.970
<v Speaker 1>this could go fucking sideways anytime</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the woods with some dudes,</v>

2217
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 1>they want to be in the woods with kids.</v>

2218
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Like how well did they vet these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>see different.</v>

2219
01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look at this,</v>

2220
01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:52.260
<v Speaker 1>write me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are these people like legit boy Scout,</v>

2222
01:38:55.291 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>really want to show everybody the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woods?</v>

2223
01:38:57.001 --> 01:38:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

2224
01:38:58.141 --> 01:38:59.460
<v Speaker 1>They're an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing,</v>

2225
01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:03.390
<v Speaker 1>amazing experience for young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just as human beings,</v>

2226
01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 1>anytime you get human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you get a certain group of human</v>

2227
01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:10.800
<v Speaker 1>beings and you leave them alone with</v>
<v Speaker 1>large groups of kids,</v>

2228
01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be super careful with what</v>

2229
01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:18.660
<v Speaker 1>their motives are and how they handle</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure and how they deal with conflict</v>

2230
01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and how they deal with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2236

<v Speaker 1>about dealing with children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>little human beings evolve and develop</v>

2318
01:42:47.951 --> 01:42:51.740
<v Speaker 4>was more about the hazards of</v>
<v Speaker 4>colonization and without the</v>

2353
01:44:25.161 --> 01:44:28.640
<v Speaker 4>going to shut it down and crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I here's what happens when we get to a</v>

2354
01:44:28.641 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 4>certain level of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're investing in those kinds of</v>

2355
01:44:31.251 --> 01:44:33.780
<v Speaker 4>films threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a threshold and though,</v>

2356
01:44:33.781 --> 01:44:38.781
<v Speaker 4>because there's so expensive to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much CGI and so much chaos</v>

2357
01:44:39.561 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 4>and special effects and an alien</v>
<v Speaker 4>covenant had a great fucking plot too.</v>

2358
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:48.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean everything was great that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many twists and turns and the</v>

2359
01:44:48.651 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 4>aliens were terrifying.</v>

2360
01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:52.970
<v Speaker 4>They explained them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was so much to it.</v>

2361
01:44:52.971 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 4>It was read a fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The finger on the pipe prometheus's for</v>

2362
01:44:57.411 --> 01:45:00.950
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people was less than than what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted.</v>

2363
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:02.840
<v Speaker 4>That's how it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a bad movie.</v>

2364
01:45:02.841 --> 01:45:04.780
<v Speaker 4>I really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was fantastic.</v>

2365
01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.320
<v Speaker 4>They were setting some shit up and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't do that well.</v>

2366
01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:09.470
<v Speaker 4>And we are spending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much the fuck they</v>

2367
01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 4>spend on those movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're super,</v>

2368
01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 4>super expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of them,</v>

2369
01:45:12.501 --> 01:45:15.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean aliens to as James Cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like blade runner level shit in my</v>

2370
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 4>opinion in the sense where like at first</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like it's a massive</v>

2371
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:22.590
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like for life it's that me</v>

2372
01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.640
<v Speaker 4>is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the question that it opens and the</v>

2373
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:30.080
<v Speaker 4>second piece where I got to shout out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>blake judd cause he said,</v>

2374
01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:32.060

<v Speaker 4>Joel.</v>

2384
01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:49.570
<v Speaker 4>they see did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was just one of their planets like</v>

2385
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.850
<v Speaker 4>our planet and they seated and they went</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2386
01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.100
<v Speaker 4>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next one should,</v>

2387

<v Speaker 4>It's like you,</v>

2554
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:47.630
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2555
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:51.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like you and this show and how like</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've had this awesome career and then</v>

2556
01:52:51.891 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 5>I only met you the first time when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>came on this show and I like smoked pot</v>

2557
01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:57.530
<v Speaker 5>in the parking lot and I was like kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of out of it.</v>

2558
01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.641
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

2559
01:52:58.641 --> 01:53:00.230
<v Speaker 5>And I came here and didn't bring a</v>
<v Speaker 5>record.</v>

2560
01:53:00.231 --> 01:53:03.220
<v Speaker 5>That's why this time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to make sure we had a record by</v>

2561
01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.190
<v Speaker 5>record.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called shooter.</v>

2562
01:53:04.191 --> 01:53:05.690
<v Speaker 5>It's out now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to say something.</v>

2563
01:53:05.691 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 5>I didn't talk about it all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but John Hensley,</v>

2564
01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:09.920
<v Speaker 5>Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my manager back then,</v>

2565
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:13.160
<v Speaker 5>he called me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't even talk about the record</v>

2566
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:14.060
<v Speaker 5>once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2567
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>

2568
01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:16.560
<v Speaker 5>We just got talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

2569
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:18.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how it is with you,</v>

2570
01:53:18.141 --> 01:53:19.850
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I love doing that with you because</v>

2571
01:53:19.851 --> 01:53:21.890
<v Speaker 5>it's like I'll go down the rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2572
01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:26.540
<v Speaker 5>I'll be on the algae at all and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are scared to do that.</v>

2573
01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:29.060
<v Speaker 5>I think don't use anything wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 5>having thoughts.</v>

2574
01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:31.310
<v Speaker 5>I said we've got to stop yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2575
01:53:31.311 --> 01:53:34.380
<v Speaker 5>Gotta stop yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this,</v>

2576
01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 5>there's the anger that we expressed</v>
<v Speaker 5>towards each other.</v>

2577
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 5>Forces anger and return when it's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>always necessary.</v>

2578
01:53:40.761 --> 01:53:43.520
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you see Nazis in</v>

2579
01:53:43.521 --> 01:53:46.090
<v Speaker 5>Charlottesville and you've got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey you dumb fucks.</v>

2580
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Like are you out of your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really want to categorize people by</v>

2581
01:53:49.341 --> 01:53:52.670
<v Speaker 5>race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is 2018 you've got to stop.</v>

2582
01:53:52.671 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 5>This is some stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the positive look at all of that</v>

2583
01:53:56.361 --> 01:53:59.900
<v Speaker 5>is the numbers of those kinds of insane</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have dwindled to a point cause I</v>

2584
01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:03.650
<v Speaker 5>remember when I was a kid and there</v>
<v Speaker 5>would be like still clan people and</v>

2585
01:54:03.651 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 5>stuff and that's just the argument for</v>
<v Speaker 5>free speech.</v>

2586
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:09.970
<v Speaker 5>The argument for free speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately it'll figure it out and</v>

2587
01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 5>analysis out.</v>

2588
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:12.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

2589
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:16.970
<v Speaker 5>I think it does and it doesn't totally</v>
<v Speaker 5>because let's just be completely honest.</v>

2590
01:54:16.971 --> 01:54:20.600
<v Speaker 5>Some people do a terrible job raising</v>
<v Speaker 5>children and these children go out into</v>

2591
01:54:20.601 --> 01:54:23.060
<v Speaker 5>the world and they're just causing</v>
<v Speaker 5>damage everywhere they go.</v>

2592
01:54:23.061 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 5>They're on fire and they just run it</v>
<v Speaker 5>through dry bushes their entire life,</v>

2593
01:54:27.651 --> 01:54:30.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're creating chaos and it's from the</v>

2594
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:34.170
<v Speaker 5>what set them off when they were young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they evolve.</v>

2595
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:39.390
<v Speaker 5>They expect everyone to have like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same starting point and be judged on</v>

2596
01:54:40.701 --> 01:54:42.590
<v Speaker 5>your emotional behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2597
01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.810
<v Speaker 5>your impulsiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2598
01:54:44.811 --> 01:54:45.644
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

2599
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dishonesty or your discipline to be</v>

2600
01:54:49.161 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 5>judged on those as if you all started</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the same spot on the board is just</v>

2601
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 5>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2602
01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 5>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is part of what we do.</v>

2603
01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:01.670
<v Speaker 5>We judge based on results only and when</v>
<v Speaker 5>we see someone to fucked up,</v>

2604
01:55:01.671 --> 01:55:02.361
<v Speaker 5>we don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2605
01:55:02.361 --> 01:55:05.330
<v Speaker 5>what happened to this person that made</v>
<v Speaker 5>them so fucking crazy,</v>

2606
01:55:05.410 --> 01:55:05.750
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2607
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:09.380
<v Speaker 5>Like is it really their fault or Zeros?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A series of events that lead to you</v>

2608
01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:11.960
<v Speaker 5>being who you are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe we should remap it.</v>

2609
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:14.990
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we should remap it and just look</v>
<v Speaker 5>at it in a different way and say,</v>

2610
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:15.840
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2611
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:18.710
<v Speaker 5>we definitely don't want that result</v>
<v Speaker 5>again ever.</v>

2612
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to figure out why you got to</v>

2613
01:55:21.261 --> 01:55:23.660
<v Speaker 5>that result.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What made you break into the bank and</v>

2614
01:55:23.661 --> 01:55:25.190
<v Speaker 5>put a gun in someone's face?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2615
01:55:25.191 --> 01:55:26.510
<v Speaker 5>how did you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2616
01:55:26.511 --> 01:55:28.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like Manson said in the bowling for</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbine.</v>

2617
01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:29.391
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

2618
01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:31.670
<v Speaker 5>well would you say to the columbine</v>
<v Speaker 5>killers?</v>

2619
01:55:31.671 --> 01:55:32.670
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would ask,</v>

2620
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:36.620
<v Speaker 5>I would ask them their opinion cause it</v>
<v Speaker 5>seems like nobody asked them their</v>

2621
01:55:36.621 --> 01:55:38.120
<v Speaker 5>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2622
01:55:38.121 --> 01:55:40.370
<v Speaker 5>So like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I asked him what the fuck happened.</v>

2623
01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they both dead?</v>

2624
01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.680
<v Speaker 5>They're both dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2625
01:55:42.681 --> 01:55:43.511
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can,</v>

2626
01:55:43.511 --> 01:55:45.660
<v Speaker 5>it's tough to ask them their opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like,</v>

2627
01:55:45.661 --> 01:55:46.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a love song,</v>

2628
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:49.790
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality is someone who,</v>

2629
01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 5>who broke like what made you break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've all broken in little ways in our</v>

2630
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:57.750
<v Speaker 5>lives and sure all lived through it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all appreciate other people who have</v>

2631
01:55:57.751 --> 01:56:00.210
<v Speaker 5>done the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you get to a point when you get</v>

2632
01:56:00.211 --> 01:56:05.040
<v Speaker 5>old enough where you realize you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch when someone is having a moment</v>

2633
01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:07.890
<v Speaker 5>that they can't make it through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you've kind of been through in ways</v>

2634
01:56:07.891 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 5>you kind of find it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2635
01:56:09.721 --> 01:56:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Those are the kinds of people that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that that will go and talk to that</v>

2636
01:56:13.441 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 5>person because they can see that and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think that you're absolutely one of</v>

2637
01:56:16.381 --> 01:56:19.080
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of people because I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually had conversations with you when</v>

2638
01:56:19.081 --> 01:56:22.680
<v Speaker 5>we were backstage at the fucking comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>store or wherever we were wounded that</v>

2639
01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:23.040
<v Speaker 5>night happened.</v>

2640
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.080
<v Speaker 5>We had a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't quite remember the whole thing,</v>

2641
01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 5>but it was about music and about</v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to music and it's like you're</v>

2642
01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:31.690
<v Speaker 5>a compassionate dude and people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2643
01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 5>that's all it's about compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about compassion and stability.</v>

2644
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.720
<v Speaker 5>It's about recognizing the best times</v>
<v Speaker 5>come when we're nice to each other.</v>

2645
01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 5>If you go to a bar and there's a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>of strange dudes you never met in your</v>

2646
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:47.340
<v Speaker 5>life and an hour later you guys are high</v>
<v Speaker 5>five and then laughing and hugging each</v>

2647
01:56:47.341 --> 01:56:50.760
<v Speaker 5>other and you're buying rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a great time.</v>

2648
01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.850
<v Speaker 5>Or you can go to a bar and someone wants</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get a dick wave and competition.</v>

2649
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:55.740
<v Speaker 5>Next thing you know you got hit in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>back of the head by a chair.</v>

2650
01:56:55.741 --> 01:56:57.090
<v Speaker 5>That's possible too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2651
01:56:57.390 --> 01:57:00.030
<v Speaker 5>You know both things are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when one feels way better.</v>

2652
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.160
<v Speaker 5>The one that feels way better is the one</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you meet,</v>

2653
01:57:02.161 --> 01:57:05.790
<v Speaker 5>meet a bunch of new friends and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys you never met before and now</v>

2654
01:57:05.791 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 5>your buddies and then you realize like I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just ran into a fucking bunch of awesome</v>

2655
01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:12.240
<v Speaker 5>dudes who are now some of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 5>people ever.</v>

2656
01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:14.630
<v Speaker 5>And if I didn't go out that night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows what would've happened?</v>

2657
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Just randomly ran into a group of</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing people and change the course of</v>

2658
01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:20.430
<v Speaker 5>your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's possible too,</v>

2659
01:57:20.431 --> 01:57:22.590
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we got to be that friend at the bar.</v>

2660
01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:25.050
<v Speaker 5>We got to be that new friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the bar and the more people it's</v>

2661
01:57:25.051 --> 01:57:26.340
<v Speaker 5>possible to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2662
01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 5>And I think a lot of it is just the way</v>
<v Speaker 5>we think of each other.</v>

2663
01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:32.910
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a problem in our operating</v>

2664
01:57:32.911 --> 01:57:37.440
<v Speaker 5>system or we have a ultra competitive</v>
<v Speaker 5>operating system and things we shouldn't</v>

2665
01:57:37.441 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 5>be competitive in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There should be.</v>

2666
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:43.500
<v Speaker 5>Then I think part of the reason is we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>lost a lot of competitiveness in life.</v>

2667
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.550
<v Speaker 5>I think people were competitive in life</v>
<v Speaker 5>in ways where there's fighting for their</v>

2668
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:48.660
<v Speaker 5>survival,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2669
01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:51.870
<v Speaker 5>They're fighting neighboring tribes the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most brutal and primitive of days.</v>

2670
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:52.800
<v Speaker 5>Azure media.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2671
01:57:52.801 --> 01:57:55.530
<v Speaker 5>And then as things changed and move</v>
<v Speaker 5>forward,</v>

2672
01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.580
<v Speaker 5>that got less and less physical and more</v>
<v Speaker 5>and more mental in the body got</v>

2673
01:57:59.581 --> 01:58:02.700
<v Speaker 5>frustrated and I think this is part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's happening along the way.</v>

2674
01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:05.460
<v Speaker 5>And then people started looking for</v>
<v Speaker 5>competition in business.</v>

2675
01:58:05.670 --> 01:58:07.410
<v Speaker 5>You ever hear like Weirdo business guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk,</v>

2676

<v Speaker 5>contract right up there.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like they're starting a war man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like super hyper hyped up business guys.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're focusing on it the wrong way.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's like if you're in the money game,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you pursue angles.</v>

<v Speaker 4>little different angles of the universe</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in the entertainment business,</v>

<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've been thinking</v>

2726
02:00:17.741 --> 02:00:19.430
<v Speaker 4>about recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially over the last,</v>

02:00:19.431 --> 02:00:23.170
<v Speaker 4>like maybe 10 years of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've decided way less things that I did</v>

2728
02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:27.880
<v Speaker 4>in the [inaudible] what I need to seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me things just sort of happen.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and they're smarter and there and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2735
02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:49.720

<v Speaker 4>Great way to communicate.</v>

2770
02:02:13.711 --> 02:02:16.840
<v Speaker 4>Like teams would communicate with you</v>
<v Speaker 4>like server addresses are all going to</v>

2771
02:02:16.841 --> 02:02:19.250
<v Speaker 4>meet up at that show is free as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The inner,</v>

2772
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 4>the government didn't even know how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking trace a phone.</v>

2773
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Literally like listen in on IRC back</v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

2774
02:02:25.191 --> 02:02:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Like they had to pick up from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hackers.</v>

2775
02:02:26.961 --> 02:02:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Like how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a very,</v>

2776
02:02:29.031 --> 02:02:33.380
<v Speaker 4>very different thing when those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those message boards and all those</v>

2777
02:02:33.381 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 4>things came up like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially like the ability to,</v>

2778
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:40.910
<v Speaker 4>we play games and talk to people in real</v>
<v Speaker 4>time during the games.</v>

2779
02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:44.870
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I'm one of the ways I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned how to type was from learning</v>

2780
02:02:44.871 --> 02:02:49.580
<v Speaker 4>how to type in game play quick cause you</v>
<v Speaker 4>got a tight quick quake one or like</v>

2781
02:02:49.581 --> 02:02:51.800
<v Speaker 4>quick what was known and what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Started with quake two,</v>

2782
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 4>quake to multiplayer could wake one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was in doom so like when quake</v>

2783
02:02:58.641 --> 02:03:02.990
<v Speaker 4>one came out and I was nine inch nails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my favorite band ever and Lynn went back</v>

2784
02:03:02.991 --> 02:03:07.310
<v Speaker 4>then and still was the influence for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he did the soundtrack.</v>

2785
02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:08.910
<v Speaker 4>I think I was a moldy shit.</v>

2786
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny that all these years later</v>

2787
02:03:11.811 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a computer but I went and</v>

2788
02:03:14.391 --> 02:03:17.060
<v Speaker 4>bought that sand because Trent reznor</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it cause she was into nine inch</v>

2789
02:03:17.061 --> 02:03:18.530
<v Speaker 4>nails and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so hot.</v>

2790
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh she has the CD of it in our house</v>
<v Speaker 4>still.</v>

2791
02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.240
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2792
02:03:23.241 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 4>I loved that and I used to do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once the Internet came on,</v>

2793
02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:30.140
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend in Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and my buddy James and Greg,</v>

2794
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.110
<v Speaker 4>greg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy ran a bbs and he bought a doom</v>

2795
02:03:33.111 --> 02:03:37.580
<v Speaker 4>to server back then where you had had</v>
<v Speaker 4>four phone lines and modems in it and</v>

2796
02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.360
<v Speaker 4>dial in 56 k days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

2797
02:03:41.361 --> 02:03:44.600
<v Speaker 4>And we would play doom two and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to like um,</v>

2798
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:48.250
<v Speaker 4>White Zombie Astra creep 2000 as</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably 14,</v>

2799
02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 4>13 just jam and this shit out man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was such a nerd.</v>

2800
02:03:52.371 --> 02:03:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Still am man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you saw my house,</v>

2801
02:03:54.010 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 4>you got to come over some time.</v>

2802
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:59.780
<v Speaker 4>But I've got like my office is like 1993</v>
<v Speaker 4>we watched laser disks,</v>

2803
02:03:59.781 --> 02:04:04.370
<v Speaker 4>we have like old computers and like old</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit everywhere.</v>

2804
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.690
<v Speaker 4>So it's like I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of frozen in a a weird</v>

2805
02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.020
<v Speaker 4>technological phase that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

2806
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:13.520
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2807
02:04:13.521 --> 02:04:17.420
<v Speaker 4>you've always been like really into like</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird Internet type shit.</v>

2808
02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Like he really ended the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cryptocurrencies and there's a thing</v>

2809
02:04:22.251 --> 02:04:23.330
<v Speaker 4>called peep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peep,</v>

2810
02:04:24.170 --> 02:04:27.260
<v Speaker 4>peep eth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on twitter or whatever.</v>

2811
02:04:27.261 --> 02:04:29.120
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a twitter alternative.</v>

2812
02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:30.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2813
02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:32.900
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just starting that.</v>

2814
02:04:32.901 --> 02:04:37.901
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peop e t h e t h.com is the thing.</v>

2815
02:04:38.610 --> 02:04:40.680
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like kind of like twitter,</v>

2816
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:42.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's built on the back of the theory</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2817
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 4>And so every tweet or I'm going to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a calling them tweets,</v>

2818
02:04:46.351 --> 02:04:48.960
<v Speaker 4>I should call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are every message that you send on</v>

2819
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like twitter is embedded in the</v>

2820
02:04:52.410 --> 02:04:54.780
<v Speaker 4>blockchain of etherium.</v>

2821
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is to explain what this site says.</v>

2822
02:04:56.341 --> 02:04:58.350
<v Speaker 4>It says the values platform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

2823
02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:00.780
<v Speaker 4>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we just uh,</v>

2824
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:06.060
<v Speaker 4>a blockchain powered social network for</v>
<v Speaker 4>our best selves.</v>

2825
02:05:06.630 --> 02:05:09.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it because you can't delete</v>

2826
02:05:09.121 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 4>anything because it's permanently</v>
<v Speaker 4>embedded in,</v>

2827
02:05:11.941 --> 02:05:15.420
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think up to 10 of your messages can be</v>

2828
02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 4>logged in one block of the theory and</v>
<v Speaker 4>chain.</v>

2829
02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:22.791
<v Speaker 4>So you have to pay like a cent of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they give you some to begin with.</v>

2830
02:05:23.341 --> 02:05:27.030
<v Speaker 4>And then when somebody messages you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a metric microtransaction</v>

2831
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:29.070
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have this kind of balance.</v>

2832
02:05:29.071 --> 02:05:31.260
<v Speaker 4>It's going all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you have to open up an account?</v>

2833
02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:35.610
<v Speaker 4>You get a sense you can do it without</v>
<v Speaker 4>any involvement.</v>

2834
02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:40.650
<v Speaker 4>But the way it works is because it's in</v>
<v Speaker 4>transactions on a blockchain and</v>

2835
02:05:40.651 --> 02:05:41.970
<v Speaker 4>ethereum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2836
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.530
<v Speaker 4>it's permanently lodged in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>permanent digital ledger in which that</v>

2837
02:05:46.650 --> 02:05:49.140
<v Speaker 4>these transactions are what's making it</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

2838
02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:51.720
<v Speaker 4>So like if you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you log in and verify yourself,</v>

2839
02:05:51.721 --> 02:05:55.650
<v Speaker 4>they give you like 30 cents because that</v>
<v Speaker 4>starts you out to be able to just kind</v>

2840
02:05:55.651 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 4>of permanently do this end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't have to do any,</v>

2841
02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:02.460
<v Speaker 4>it sounds complicated but it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I don't,</v>

2842
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:04.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it will become like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next rage,</v>

2843
02:06:04.771 --> 02:06:07.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's technologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really fucking fun.</v>

2844
02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Might be launching it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to that page again and expand on</v>

2845
02:06:12.061 --> 02:06:15.270
<v Speaker 4>the right hand side where it shows you</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the different categories and the</v>

2846
02:06:15.271 --> 02:06:20.100
<v Speaker 4>different values,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but make that a larger social media</v>

2847
02:06:20.130 --> 02:06:25.130
<v Speaker 4>bringing out our best with opinionated</v>
<v Speaker 4>features and immune immutability.</v>

2848
02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:06:28.530 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 4>How often do you hear that word?</v>
