1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.810
Yes.
Is it good?
Yeah,
go ahead.

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.490
<v 1>All right.
Cut all this sounds right.
Right,
right.
Hello Adam.
Hey,</v>

3
00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.350
thanks for having me.
Thanks for being here,
man.

4
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.210
I'm pretty sure I'm a giant fan of your show.

5
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:20.670
I really appreciate the fact that it annoys people to really business people
off.

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.220
That's the goal,
pretty much,
you know,
I mean,
I'm not a cat person where I'm like,

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.080
ah,
if you're pissing people off,
you're doing something right.

8
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:28.170
But there's some tricks to this to that.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.310
And also the way you structured the name,
I mean,

10
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:32.710
I don't know if you came up with the name of it,
but Adam ruins everything.

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.800
I think I might have to give that to my,
to my former boss,

12
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.920
Sam writes to college humor.
Might've might've,
uh,

13
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.240
I think we came up with the name together.

14
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:44.240
He might've been the first person to say it,
but uh,
yeah.
Thank you.
I'm really,
I,

15
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:46.570
yeah,
like let's,
you know,
it lets you know that,
hey,

16
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:48.460
this is going to know you a little bit,
but like,

17
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.980
I'm going to be telling you shit that you don't want to hear.

18
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:52.840
That's gonna make everything a little bit worse,
you know?

19
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.160
But at the end of the day,
it makes it better.

20
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.170
It's an optimistic show at the end of the day where,
sure,
yeah.
Yeah.

21
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.520
You give them the truth.
I think that,
yeah,
I mean the,
the,

22
00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:03.670
the thesis of the show is that it's always better to know the truth and it's a

23
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:06.970
momentarily uncomfortable,
but hopefully for most people,

24
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:08.560
99% of people who watch the show,

25
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.320
it grinds your gears a little bit to find out something,
oh,

26
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.230
I thought that was true with the act crap,
you know?
But then at the end,

27
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.260
we show you why you're actually better off knowing that thing and you're always

28
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:21.180
better off knowing the truth in my view,
in my view as well.
Yeah.
Was there ever,

29
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.520
was there one episode that stands out as being one that people got the most

30
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:29.170
upset about a year?
There's a bunch of them.
I mean,

31
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:33.400
people get,
people get upset with us for a lot of different reasons.

32
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:38.401
We did one about how I'm a breastfeeding isn't better than formula feeding.

33
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:43.660
It's a no,
they're both like formula feeding is fine,
you know,

34
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:47.540
and if the problem is if eating become a stigma to stigmatized now,
um,

35
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.520
and there's a lot of people who can't breastfeed or who for medical reasons,

36
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:54.190
you know,
uh,
and uh,
uh,

37
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.030
the fact is that forming formula is like a scientifically proven wonderful way

38
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:01.540
to feed a baby.
And if you know someone's choice or need us to do that,

39
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:03.860
there's no reason to stigmatize.
And we go through all the reasons that,

40
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.250
that that's the case.
And yeah,
people get a little,
you know,

41
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.520
there's a lot of people who sort of have an ideology about that,
you know,
and uh,

42
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.800
don't want to hear the truth about it.
Um,

43
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
we did one about a trophy hunting animals about how cause people,

44
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:19.300
young people get so mad.
I'll look at this guy shot a lion,
right?

45
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.040
And the truth is that,
uh,
in some countries,
not 100% of the time,

46
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.640
but in some countries,
they are effectively using trophy hunting as a way to,
to,

47
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:34.390
uh,
protect the animals because that's how they're able to sort of like monetize,

48
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.590
you know,
in that place.
And,
uh,
you know,
get money coming in,

49
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.270
in order to protect the animals.
And they're,

50
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.110
they're very specific and strategic about it and it can be part of a good,

51
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.800
you know,
sort of animal management,
you know,

52
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.470
strategy and it's being used to some success,
you know?
Um,
and yeah,

53
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.750
people don't want to hear that.
Right.
It's still really hard.

54
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.640
That's a weird one to me.
And I hunt.
Yeah.
That,
that,
that the whole,

55
00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:00.130
the whole lion and elephant

56
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.780
<v 2>thing,</v>

57
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.310
<v 1>right?
Ooh,
that's a weird one.
But know what they can do is they can say,
okay,</v>

58
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:06.450
well we've got these elephants,

59
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.930
one of these elephants is an old male that's like killing the other elephants.

60
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.680
Right.

61
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.820
And if we organize these hunts where you got to pay half a million dollars for

62
00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:16.760
the right to even go in there,
right.

63
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.580
<v 2>Well with the old male elephants.
I know that was the issue with that giraffe.</v>

64
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.750
That woman that got actually don't know that specific case.
Yeah,
there was a,

65
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.050
there was a woman who got in trouble because she shot this really beautiful

66
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:28.710
giraffe.

67
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.220
It was really dark and unusually colored and it was dark because it was very
old.

68
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.430
The older the Giraffe,
apparently the males get really dark.

69
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.300
It was really cool looking.
Um,

70
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.700
but she shot it and everybody went crazy on the internet because,
you know,

71
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.740
she was posing and smiling with this drought.

72
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:48.540
But apparently that giraffe had to be killed because it had killed at least two,

73
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.790
maybe three young males,

74
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.090
and it was no longer have a viable breeding age.

75
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:57.660
So they were in this situation where they didn't have the money to take it and

76
00:03:57.661 --> 00:03:59.960
bring it to a zoo somewhere and the,

77
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:03.240
they would have gotten money from having this woman come in and shoot it.

78
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.103
So that's what they did.

79
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.410
<v 1>Yeah,
that's Sorta,
that's sort of the idea,
you know.
Um,
I mean,</v>

80
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.820
one of the issues is if you've got an area where,
you know,

81
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.600
one of the problems is you need to have a reason for the people who live in the

82
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:18.990
place to care about the animals.
You know what I mean?
If it's just like,
hey,

83
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.390
the elephants are going to roam free,
well you've got people there who are like,

84
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:22.950
all right,
fine.
So I'm living near some elephants.

85
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:25.080
Occasionally they eat my crops and shit and that annoys me.

86
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:28.080
I don't really give occasionally.
Yeah,
exactly.
I don't give a shit about that.

87
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.260
And what that allows to happen is allows poachers to come in and kill them.

88
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:34.170
Wantonly Right?
But if instead,
okay,
we're protecting them,

89
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.950
we have a revenue stream,
right?
We get money when,
you know,

90
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.040
hunters come in and pay a lot of money to go kill one animal.

91
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.740
Right now we've got a way to hire guards.

92
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:46.830
We've got a way this is now a resource that we're protecting.
Right?

93
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.970
And that sounds a little cynical,
but it is working in some places and it's both.

94
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:53.310
It's cynical and effect and effective.
And we have a,

95
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:58.311
we had a woman on from the IECN International Union for Conservation of nature,

96
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.560
big conservation group,
talking about how this is effective now in some places,

97
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:03.690
if you've got a corrupt government where they're just going to pocket the bunny.

98
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:04.800
Yeah,
that's bad.
Right?

99
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.450
But the point is just because the mere idea of someone going overseas and

100
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:12.780
killing an animal is not necessarily the worst thing in the world.

101
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.250
We have to look at the details of the situation.

102
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:17.070
And it's hard for animal lovers to hear.
Animal lovers don't like to hear that.

103
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.560
Uh,
yeah,

104
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.650
<v 2>they don't.
They don't.
And I,
like I said,
I don't like to hear it.</v>

105
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.690
You hear it either.
I wish people would just,

106
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.050
it just what freaks me out more than anything is that there's no other options.

107
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.570
It's not like a bunch of people are donating a bunch of money to keep these

108
00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:38.430
areas clean and free of poachers.
And

109
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.320
<v 1>the amount would be massive.
Right?
We can,
we can donate money,
but yeah,
that,</v>

110
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.310
that's the,

111
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.850
when you've got a problem that big and intractable as how do you save these

112
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:52.260
animals,
you know,
and uh,
against habitat encroachment,
right?
Again,
you know,

113
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:56.250
people want to farm on that land.
People,
you know,
people have,
people have lives,

114
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:57.620
right?
They're not sitting around going,

115
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.870
the people in those countries not sitting around going,
oh,

116
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.420
I love the cute elephants.
Like we have the luxury to do.

117
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:05.360
They like fucking live there.
Right?
And so how do you get,

118
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.170
how do you get those people and that society to,
to really protect those animals?

119
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.490
That's a hard question to answer.

120
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.150
And some places are having success with that strategy and that's something that

121
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.600
we can understand.
We don't have to approve of it in every single case.

122
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.330
And we can say that's really tough for us as animal lovers.
And in fact,

123
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:22.070
the character I'm talking to on the show says,

124
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.930
I still just hate the idea of an animal being killed,
right?
And I said,
yes.

125
00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:29.480
So Do I.
Right.
We try to dramatize that emotional,
you know,

126
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.180
resistance on the show,
like that emotional reaction that we have.

127
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.380
I also don't like the idea of,
of an animal being killed brutally.
You know,

128
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.600
I think I'm uncomfortable with the idea,
right?

129
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.870
But if my main goal is to preserve the population of these animals overall and

130
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.590
stopped them from going extinct,

131
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.600
maybe I need to accept that this tough truth that once in a time,

132
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.770
once in a while,
once gotta be shot through the head with a rifle,

133
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.530
maybe I need to accept that it's,
it's weird.

134
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.540
That's what I chose about really when it comes to things

135
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.280
<v 3>we don't eat,
like lions and stuff</v>

136
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.290
and the psychology,
Michael Douglas and the,

137
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.480
what was that movie with the Val Kilmer,

138
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.610
the ghost and the darkness that the lions that decided to kill those dudes are

139
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.300
what never heard of this movie.
Great movie ghost in the darkness.

140
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.710
I feel like it's from the 90s,

141
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.910
but it's a really good movie about a true story about this guy that they

142
00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:22.441
brought.

143
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:26.850
They brought this Michael Douglas character was brought in to hunt these lions

144
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:30.960
that were systematically targeting and killing these workers that worked on this

145
00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:35.340
railroad.
This team of lions worked together and started eating people.
Wow,

146
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.800
that's great.
My Way and

147
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.550
<v 1>it sounds like it.
And they have to,
they have to go for the lions.</v>

148
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.060
They have to go kill these lines.
Yeah,
there it is.
Ghost in the darkness.

149
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.950
Oh holy hell biting tension.
That is a great tell Kilmer's looking good there.

150
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.750
<v 3>No,
that was pre Fatso Kilmer</v>

151
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.560
<v 1>pretty when he went off to do it was too good looking guy handle anymore looking</v>

152
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:55.760
guy too.
Handsome

153
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.260
<v 3>problem.
You had to just go off the deep end.</v>

154
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.660
<v 1>Another one people got really mad about this is this weirdly the one we got the</v>

155
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:03.450
biggest reaction to.
Um,

156
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.130
and to the extent that I'm a little hesitant talking about it,

157
00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:09.610
cause it always starts to shift storm every time I do.
But scenes.
Uh,
no,

158
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:11.470
actually we've not done a whole one on vaccines.
Uh,

159
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.030
but we really should cause it's coming back.

160
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:17.020
I used to think that vaccines was like kind of done as a topic and like we've

161
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:20.860
gone through it.
It is really,
it is really backing.
It is big.
Um,
but no,

162
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:22.420
we did one on Alpha males.

163
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:27.421
We had an episode about dating and we did one on how the idea of the Alpha male

164
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.560
doesn't exist in humans.
Like if you talk to any anthropologist,

165
00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:35.440
any biologist and you sociologists,
right?
And be like,

166
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:39.340
Dee Dee are humans organized in a social relationship where there's Alphas and

167
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:41.950
Betas?
The be like,
no,
what are you talking about?
This is an unscientific idea.

168
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.780
Right?
And we just did something laying that out in a,
in the,

169
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:48.460
in the context of like,
people who are all my type is,
I like Alphas,
right?
Well,

170
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.490
there's no such thing actually,
you know,
humans are some,
your dominant,

171
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:53.590
some situations not in others.
Right?
Um,

172
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.920
it's an overly simplistic way of looking human relationships.

173
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.620
And I thought that was a pretty simple,
straightforward thing.
I was like,

174
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.770
there's just a bit of pseudoscience that you hear people tossing out and people

175
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.771
went ballistic on the Internet because people have sort of like built a edifice

176
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.760
of ideology in their minds about like,
there's Alphas,

177
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:13.770
they're spayed is I'm an Alpha,
this is what now feels like,

178
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.220
this is what a Beta is like,
you know,
um,
and uh,

179
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.050
<v 2>words.
Yeah.
They're there.</v>

180
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.920
They're clearly men who are more aggressive and athletic and dominant and more

181
00:09:23.921 --> 00:09:28.921
confident and s and then men who are introverted and shy and more nervous and

182
00:09:30.161 --> 00:09:31.840
anxious.
And there's a scale

183
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.860
<v 1>in some,
in some situations,
you know,
situations.
Yeah.</v>

184
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.480
And that's what we're talking about,
right?
In social.
Well,
yeah,

185
00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:41.480
but you're a social situation could change based on what situation you're in.

186
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.400
You know what I mean?
Like,

187
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.240
<v 2>but,
uh,
a login,
athletic,</v>

188
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:47.660
confident male is always going to be an athletic,

189
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:52.661
confident male and an introverted anxious male who has problems with social

190
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:57.940
anxiety is going to be the same.
That's that,
that that's

191
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.380
<v 1>personally,
I don't think so necessarily.
Um,
but,
uh,</v>

192
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.350
so when we're talking about Alpha,
when you talk about Alphas,
right?
Um,

193
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.550
in animals,
what is that?
It's a social hierarchy,
right?
When you're done,

194
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.720
<v 2>take away that word.</v>

195
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.110
I mean w but what people are using to describe when they're saying Alphas and

196
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:17.920
Betas,
they're saying like confident,
strong,

197
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:21.320
secure people and people that are anxious and not sure.

198
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.660
<v 1>So if you're,
so if you're trying to say,
hey,</v>

199
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.880
like it's good to be confident and not so great to be anxious like that,

200
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.160
that's fine.
Right?

201
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.790
But when people talk about Alpha males and Beta males right there specifically

202
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:35.170
bringing in the language of like evolution of biology,
of zoology,
of,

203
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.360
of evolutionary psychology,
you know,
and they'll start saying stuff like,
well,

204
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:42.710
there's Alphas and there's Betas and women are hardwired to be attracted to the

205
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:44.990
Alpha,
you know,
because that's what it's like in nature.

206
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:46.340
Like there'll be using that language.
Right?

207
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.120
And so what we're pointing out is that's not scientific,
right?

208
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.050
<v 2>It's not scientific.</v>

209
00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:53.830
But it is true that women are hardwired to be attracted to confident athletic

210
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:54.220
men.

211
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.480
<v 1>I don't know.
Well,
I don't know if I agree with that.
Um,</v>

212
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.470
but yeah,

213
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.650
<v 2>you don't think that women look at like pro athletes.
And like big,</v>

214
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:05.210
strong athletic men.

215
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.420
And you don't think they're drawn to that for evolutionary reasons?

216
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.720
<v 1>I know.
I don't actually,
I think</v>

217
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.320
<v 2>that men are drawn to women with small waists and big hips and large breasts for</v>

218
00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:16.160
evolutionary reasons,

219
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.710
<v 1>reasons,
uh,
you know,
I think that's an easy,
I think what that is,</v>

220
00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:24.130
is that an easy intuition to come to if you're like looking at the way people

221
00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:25.030
behave,
right.

222
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.330
But one of the things about evolutionary psychology is it's the most common

223
00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:32.260
mistake to look at the way that people do behave and say,

224
00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:35.530
the reason what the we behave that way is because evolution says that's the best

225
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:38.620
way.
Right?
That's their argument.
For instance,
I'll give you an exact,

226
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:41.320
that's the argument that was arguments like that were used for instance,

227
00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:45.250
to justify slavery,
right?
That like,
oh,
because you know,
uh,

228
00:11:45.251 --> 00:11:49.090
whites and blacks have this hierarchical relationship and American society,

229
00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:51.670
that's the way it was intended.
That's how nature intended it to be.
Right?

230
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.610
But we can't,
we get it

231
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.520
<v 2>giant loop.
The shapes of bodies.</v>

232
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.910
Men Universally are attracted to a certain shape of bodies.

233
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.020
There's men that are attracted to different ones and do that
at the same area,

234
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.130
but that hourglass shape has been throughout time,

235
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.040
something that men are attracted to.
I think that hourglass shape,

236
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:16.070
<v 1>but something throughout our recent cultural memory that we tell each other that</v>

237
00:12:16.621 --> 00:12:19.410
men are attracted to it.
Right?
That's when,
that's when we're,

238
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.420
that's what we're told from an early age to this,

239
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:24.870
that this is the sort of women that men are attracted to and so a lot of men

240
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:26.220
ended up adopting that.
Right.

241
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.790
But I don't think that deep down that's how men naturally are.
You know,

242
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.520
<v 2>I read this or that,
but that doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

243
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.920
That's so intuitive because I'm all about things that are not intuitive,

244
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.900
but where do you think it started?
Where do you think this,

245
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:44.890
this narrative of men being attracted to women with large breasts in a small

246
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:47.290
waist and a big ass?
Where do you think that started?

247
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:51.430
Because this is like evolutionary biology is pretty much settled on the idea

248
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:55.570
that the reason why the large hips would indicate that the woman be easier to

249
00:12:55.571 --> 00:13:00.400
give birth.
Having large breasts and a large acid indicate that she has,
uh,
she's,

250
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:05.470
she's fertile and then she has an ample fat storage in the right places if she's

251
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:07.120
going to be pregnant and carry children.

252
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.300
There's all these like evolutionary biology reasons why people are attracted to

253
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:17.040
certain things.
Why woman,
we'd be attracted to a tall,
muscular,

254
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.340
handsome man.
Good genetics,
very strong and confident could take care of her.

255
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.710
All these things are based on evolutionary biology.

256
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.210
So in understand why you think these are learned sort of cultural artists.

257
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.310
<v 1>So my,
my question is,
this is an assumption that we,</v>

258
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.250
the public make about how evolutionary biology works,
right?

259
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.630
It's more of a thing that we sort of agree on.
Well,
we,
we as the,

260
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.450
like there's a,
there's an idea among the public that this is true.

261
00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:43.070
I don't know if it's a scientific idea.

262
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.463
<v 2>That's my,</v>

263
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.290
I've had conversations with evolutionary biologist who explained the reason why

264
00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:51.410
men are attracted to certain shapes and why women are attracted to certain

265
00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:56.300
shapes.
This is,
this is sort of,
I mean,
this is science in a way.

266
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:56.780
I mean this,

267
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.780
the reason why they're attracted to tall men that are muscular and confident is

268
00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:06.620
because that is what's always saved you throughout history.

269
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.960
I mean co to only make sense,
doesn't it?

270
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.190
<v 1>It it.
Well,
just because it makes the point of our show,
right,</v>

271
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.880
is that just because something makes intuitive sense doesn't mean that it's

272
00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:18.110
necessarily true.
Right?

273
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.200
<v 2>You think that in this case that this is a varied argument,</v>

274
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.840
like I don't think that's something that you can dismiss.

275
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.580
<v 1>I don't,
I don't dismiss it,</v>

276
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:32.440
but I don't assume the truth of it simply because that's what you know everybody

277
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:33.490
agrees upon.
Right?

278
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.790
<v 2>If you ask girls like,
what are you into?
And you say,</v>

279
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.380
if you are you into tall,
muscular,
confident men who are also nice to do,

280
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.160
Jesus Christ,
it's going to be off the charts.
It's going to be like most of them.

281
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.510
I'm,
you know,
I'm really,
I'm really not sure that's the case.
Really.
Yeah.
You,

282
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.980
you had like a survey of,
and the

283
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.210
<v 4>men were equally kind and equally intelligent and,
and friendly.</v>

284
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.860
You don't think that more women will be sexually attracted to these tall,

285
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.480
handsome men with great bodies?
I mean,
look,
I'm not gonna,

286
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.770
I'm not gonna say that first of all,
you're positing like a value judgment in it,

287
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:11.150
that the,
that the bodies are great,
right?

288
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:14.420
So like are women attracted to attractive bodies?
If that's the question then,

289
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.450
then I would say of course more attracted to women's study finds some fucking

290
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.930
I'm talking about with the dad bod.

291
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.340
Here's something that I was really influenced by.
I ran what I just said though.

292
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.060
That doesn't make sense to you that women would be attracted to someone who's

293
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.270
fit.
Look,
I mean,
it's a,
it's a hypothetical rate.

294
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.130
Like I certainly athleticism,
right?
Is something that is attractive.
Right?

295
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.950
Um,
that's something that many people find attractive,
right?

296
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.650
Not everybody finds that attractive.
Um,

297
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.180
and I don't think that we can necessarily recent backwards to like a specific

298
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.010
evolutionary relationship.
Right?
Um,

299
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.530
because the truth of what those evolutionary relationships are is like often a

300
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:58.400
lot more complicated then you know,
our,
our immediate intuition about it.

301
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.250
And what were you specifically pushing back against in that segment is like the

302
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:05.060
really sort of unscientific,
you know,

303
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.440
of Alpha and Beta.
Yeah,
exactly.
Where it's like,
you know,
you've got people,

304
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.550
you know,
just on internet forums like sort of doing amateur pseudoscience,
right?

305
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:14.240
Saying like,

306
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.970
this is how the relationships between men and women are like designed

307
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.140
evolutionarily.
Um,
and we were just pointing out on a very,
very simple level,

308
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.190
like the Alpha and Beta social hierarchy theory,
right?
Um,

309
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.030
that like a humans are organized in a social hierarchy and Alphas are above

310
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.280
Betas.
Not True.
Right?
Um,

311
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.690
even someone who is the person who you posited,
right?

312
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:40.460
The person who is a athletic and confidence,
right?
The,
uh,
you know,

313
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:43.790
the high school football quarterback,
right?
Versus the high school football nerd,

314
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.640
right.
We'll take those two people and then put them in a different situation,

315
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.850
right.
If those two people are like in gym class together,
right.
Of course,

316
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:53.630
the high school quarterback is like,
I'm the top of that social interaction,

317
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:57.380
right.
I'm looking at the sort of,
you know,
classic Wolf Pack Model.

318
00:16:57.381 --> 00:16:59.210
They're the one who sort of sort of running the show,
right?

319
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:01.430
And the other guys like hanging out in the bleachers,
talking to his friends,

320
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:04.880
right?
Or talking to nobody because he's a,
he's a Beta and that situation,
right?

321
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.470
If you then take that kid and then you,
you know,
send that kid to like nationals,

322
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.720
right?
Or whatever,
uh,
you know,
and that kid,
sorry,

323
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.450
I take the quarterback character,
um,
and you know,
he suddenly like,
you know,

324
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:20.960
from the little podunk town,
right?
He's not from the big school.
Um,

325
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.300
he's like way down on the Totem Pole,
right?

326
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.540
That person is no longer going to be in that high social hierarchy,
right?
Um,

327
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.710
and if you take that nerd and you put that,
you know,
take that kid,

328
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:34.070
maybe he's the dungeon master of his,
you know,
dungeon and dragons group,
right?

329
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.540
Um,
uh,
that,
uh,
why that kid is going to be the alpha in that situation,
right?

330
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:39.740
That's how humans work.
You know,

331
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:43.370
humans aren't organized in sort of like little pods that stay together for life,

332
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:45.320
and there's one person who's dominant the whole time,
right?

333
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.580
And that's the simple point that we were making,
uh,
in that,
right?
Um,

334
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.750
and people got upset.
Yeah,

335
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:54.660
people got upset because there are so many people who we talked about this later

336
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:57.480
on the show,
there's this idea called the backfire effect,
right?

337
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.050
Where when people are told something that they don't agree with,
um,

338
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.910
that when they,
when they,
someone has told somebody a fact,

339
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.290
when somebody has told the fact that contradicts like a really deeply held

340
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:11.540
belief,
it can often cause them to disbelieve it even when it's true.
Right?

341
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.080
In fact,
that fight back even harder,

342
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.560
one of the reasons that happens is because of an idea called identity protective

343
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:17.810
cognition.
It's,
um,

344
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.390
if the fact that is being debunked is literally part of your identity.

345
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.460
Like if a sign that you believe really,
really deeply,

346
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.860
it's incredibly hard for you to disbelieve it,
right?

347
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:29.160
The classic example of this is like,
you know,
Sean Hannity,

348
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.600
Sean Hannity doesn't believe in climate change,
right?
Uh,
uh,
really?
Uh,
well,

349
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:37.170
you know what,
uh,
I actually don't know that specifically what Shawnee,

350
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.370
Sean Handy things about climate change.

351
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:41.580
And let's just say somebody who's made their whole career on climate change

352
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:45.270
doesn't exist,
right?
All their friends are in the anti climate change community,

353
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.620
right?
Uh,
they met their wife at an anti climate change fund raiser.

354
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.800
You know what I mean?
They make their money,

355
00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:52.980
they write a new anti climate change book every year.
Right?
Now,

356
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.690
climate change is real,
right?

357
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.440
There's no evidence I could present that person with that is going to make them

358
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:03.060
take the social risk of ending all their relationships changing their whole

359
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:06.660
life.
Right.
Uh,
because if they were to say,
okay,
you know what,
actually,

360
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:09.180
I'm convinced climate change is real.
They would lose all their friends.

361
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.130
Their wife would leave them,
they would lose their revenue stream.

362
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:14.670
They can't possibly come to that conclusion.
Right?
And so they fight back.

363
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:17.880
So super hard.
Right?
And so that's what ended up happening with that segment.

364
00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:22.881
There's a whole group of people who have built their whole lives on the idea.

365
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.880
There's Alphas and Betas.
I'm an Alpha.
I'm not going to be a Beta.
Right.
Um,

366
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.410
and so,
and,
and maybe that misalign positive to them,
you know,
maybe they had,

367
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:34.320
were in a bad place in their life and through this model of Alpha versus Beta,

368
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.140
they started working out or they started,
you know,

369
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.140
improving themselves a little bit.
Right.
Um,

370
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.610
and maybe they started acting a little bit more confidently and now they're in a

371
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:42.301
relationship.
Right?

372
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:45.930
All those things can be true with the idea of Alphas and Betas and humans not

373
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:46.800
being scientific.
Right?

374
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.670
But so when I tell them that they fight back really hard though.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,

375
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:54.120
no.
This is,
this is real.
This is real.
You know,
and so that video,
which again,

376
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.590
I had no idea that would be controversial.

377
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:59.250
Got the most youtube response videos get the most,
you know,

378
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:03.150
furious at things from,
and the weirdest thing was people started to say,

379
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.970
this is political.
Like,
why is that in ruins?
Everything getting political.

380
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:08.130
I'm like,
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
This is,

381
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.480
I have no idea.

382
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.630
I didn't have no idea how it's political alphas and Betas are no political.

383
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.050
I mean,
that's what people were saying,
I guess.
Uh,
I guess,
you know,

384
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:19.170
for some people it's become that,
but because they've seen it as part of like,

385
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:19.650
I don't know,

386
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.870
whatever argument they're in their head they're having about feminism or

387
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:25.860
something like that.
But to me,
I'm just like,
guys in dating right in life,

388
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.740
like this is not a real concept.
If you want to say,

389
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.840
I'm going to be confident tomorrow,
I'm not going to tell you,

390
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:34.410
that's not gonna help you out.
You know.
Um,
uh,
and you know,

391
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.500
I am a little bit reticent to make like a broad conclusion about evolutionary

392
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:40.980
psychology.
Right.
But I can tell you,
again,
go talk to any anthropologist,

393
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.380
any biologist,
and he,
you know,
sociologists.

394
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.160
Is there such a thing as Alpha males in humans and the strictest scientific

395
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.003
sense of the word

396
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.670
<v 2>industry.
Yeah,
exactly.
Um,
and the,
I think they're looking at,</v>

397
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:55.990
in terms of like winners and losers,
pushovers and people who get the job done,

398
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.260
you know,
confident people versus people who are not confident.

399
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.120
But I think you're correct.

400
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.240
And I think obviously humans operate on a giant spectrum.

401
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.020
And if you start going around saying Alpha and Beta and the,

402
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.780
the idea that all alphas are the same or all Betas of the same,

403
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:14.100
it's just as ridiculous as the idea of saying all democrats are the same.

404
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:18.220
We're all republicans.
It becomes an ideology.
Exactly.
Pro Male ideology.

405
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.320
And at Shar,

406
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.480
I ha the biggest problem with like overconfident men's rights guys.

407
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:28.720
Yeah.
Cause I'm like,
listen,
we have all the rights,
like

408
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.670
settled down.
Enough of them,
I had a whole bit about it.
It was like,

409
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.870
this is like divorce laws and that's it.
Everything else is stacked in our favor.

410
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:40.240
It's just fucking chill out.
You're making us look bad.

411
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.220
And the problems that men have

412
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.160
<v 4>are different than the problems those guys think men have.
Right.
Um,</v>

413
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.280
so for instance,
we did a segment on a stereotype.

414
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.880
We had an episode on stereotypes,
um,
called Adam ruins a sitcom where,
uh,

415
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.160
we talked about different,
you know,
we talked about stereotypes via,
you know,

416
00:21:58.161 --> 00:22:00.870
sort of,
uh,
uh,
cheesy 80 sitcom had a stereotypes in it.

417
00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:03.140
So you've got the stereotypical black kid,
he got the stereotypical,
an Asian kid,

418
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.660
he got a Syrian neighbor,
what's his name?
Do you have a gay neighbor?
No,

419
00:22:05.661 --> 00:22:07.850
we didn't do that.
Well,
there's only three acts on the show.
You know what I mean?

420
00:22:07.851 --> 00:22:11.030
I wish we could on that and,
and women and all sorts of things.
But we,

421
00:22:11.031 --> 00:22:13.910
and we had a stereotypical dad,
you know,
like a home improvement type dad,

422
00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.900
you know,
and,
uh,
what we talked about is like those,
uh,

423
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.960
there are ways that men are being harmed by the sort of narrow idea of what a

424
00:22:24.441 --> 00:22:27.920
man is.
You know,
um,
for instance,
uh,

425
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:32.540
men have a very high suicide rate.
Right.
Um,
and,
uh,

426
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.130
specifically,
uh,
loneliness is a health problem for men,

427
00:22:37.131 --> 00:22:41.030
for like older men.
Like take my dad,
right?
My Dad's a about 65.

428
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.410
He doesn't have a friend,
you know,
I hope he doesn't hear this,
but um,
you know,

429
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.600
yeah.
Like he,
he has like work colleagues.
He's got my mom,
you know,
he's got me,

430
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.880
he's got,
I'm sure he's got people he's friendly with,
you know what I mean?

431
00:22:52.881 --> 00:22:54.670
But he doesn't have a best friend,
you know,
who doesn't,

432
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.580
who comes over to watch the red sox with them to is terrifying to me.
Yeah.

433
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.570
And the thing is,

434
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.290
loneliness is associated with early death and with disease.
Right?

435
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.600
And like when you look at the way that we bring up men,

436
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.140
men are socialized to not have close relationships with each other.
You know?

437
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.780
Yeah.
I mean,
well,
like,
uh,
we talk about,
uh,

438
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.430
from an early age,
we talked about this so briefly on the show,

439
00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:23.840
but we could have gone into a whole episode on it from an early age.
Uh,
uh,

440
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:28.750
researchers have found this,
that,
uh,
little boys,
when they're very young,
uh,

441
00:23:28.751 --> 00:23:29.960
are very close with form,

442
00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:32.330
very close friendships that are physical friends with they hug,
you know,

443
00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:34.520
they'll kiss,
they'll,
you know,
cause I'm the,
you know what I mean?

444
00:23:34.521 --> 00:23:36.260
They'll have physical,
close friendships like that,

445
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.280
and then they reach an age where that starts to become not okay.
Right.
Um,

446
00:23:40.281 --> 00:23:42.440
where it becomes,
oh,
that's not how boys act.
Right.

447
00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:44.120
And girls are still doing that with their friends.

448
00:23:44.121 --> 00:23:47.690
They're still holding hands with friends.
You know,
there's still,
uh,
you know,

449
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:51.050
having close relationships like that and boys start to start to build a little

450
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:54.920
bit of diff distance,
you know,
and,
you know,
it's easy to say,
well,

451
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:58.130
when you're a teenager,
that's because the stigma against being gay and like,

452
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:00.500
we don't want to appear gay,
but it happens even younger than like,

453
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.180
kids would even have a notion of that,
you know?

454
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.750
So it really seems to be a deep down way that we bring up boys of like,
Hey,

455
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:08.450
don't get too close to each other.
You know what I mean?
That's a little weird.

456
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.600
It's just a little weird for boys to do that,
you know?
And we do that.

457
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.980
We do it from a young age.
It's very subtle
and subtle,

458
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:20.600
but it's universal.
I mean,
in America it seems to be,
um,
and,
uh,

459
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:24.470
you know,
I,
uh,
yeah,
I've even felt that myself.

460
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:29.020
Like I've often had an easier time having close,
close relationships with,
uh,

461
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.330
women rather than men as friendships.
Yeah.
As friendships.
Yeah.

462
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.960
<v 5>Man,
I don't,
just in terms of who I talk about,
my relationships and stuff,
you,</v>

463
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.090
I have good friendships with women.
Mostly they're comics,

464
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:44.320
but almost all my good friends are guys,
a lot of good friends.
I mean,

465
00:24:44.321 --> 00:24:46.840
you're lucky if that's the case.
I certainly am.

466
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.040
But there's this phenomenon of having little bit of distance from your male

467
00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:52.230
friends,
you know,
of like

468
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.710
<v 4>being,
of not getting really into it emotionally,
you know,
look it,</v>

469
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.330
<v 5>if you don't feel that way,
that's fine.</v>

470
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.430
I felt that myself and I'm sure results in some people don't.

471
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.690
Some people feel it.
I'm sure I don't experience that.
You know,

472
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.220
most of my friends that I know have good male friends and they were pretty tight

473
00:25:12.221 --> 00:25:16.810
with people.
Well,
when,
uh,
the,
the point is that like there is a trend,

474
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.460
especially in older age,
right?
It's bad.
And then my dad's name for anybody,

475
00:25:21.461 --> 00:25:24.820
whether it's a male or female,
when you get older and you don't have any friends,

476
00:25:24.821 --> 00:25:27.220
that's a bad scene.
Well,
so demographic.
Yeah.

477
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.480
<v 4>We know that that happens to men more than women,
right?
That man,</v>

478
00:25:30.481 --> 00:25:34.470
my dad's age is more likely to have less friends than a woman my mom's age.

479
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.870
Um,
I mean,

480
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.690
I think that's one of those things where I would hesitate to make a big

481
00:25:39.691 --> 00:25:40.630
conclusion.
But I mean,

482
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.380
I would say I think we can draw a link between that and you know,

483
00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:45.960
that men are sort of like socialized to not have these close friendships,

484
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:50.430
but right.
So that is a serious problem that men have that men face.
Right.

485
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.640
Um,
another one we talk about is stuff like,
you know,

486
00:25:53.641 --> 00:25:54.990
drinking and smoking for instance.

487
00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.840
Those are behaviors that are much more pushed on that.
And you know,

488
00:25:57.841 --> 00:26:01.560
those are much more advertised towards men,
right?
And those are dangerous,
right?

489
00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.440
Those are like hurt you physically and can lead to an early death,
right?

490
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.120
Those are,
those can lead to bad health outcomes.

491
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.380
And so those are things that men face that are different than the challenges

492
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:13.200
that women face and can result in bad health outcomes for us.
You know,

493
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.100
and it's so funny how the sort of like men's rights people,
you know,
they're,

494
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.590
they don't talk about that stuff quite as much.
They talk about,
you know,

495
00:26:19.591 --> 00:26:24.510
violence and,
and,
um,
you know,
uh,
people being hurt at work and stuff like that.

496
00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:26.190
Like men having dangerous occupations and that's,

497
00:26:26.191 --> 00:26:27.840
and that stuff true is true as well.

498
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.440
But like these are the more subtle ways that,
you know,
men are,
uh,

499
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.490
are hurt by,
uh,

500
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.220
this sort of narrow expectations of what a man is that we put on men.
Hey,

501
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.170
men are like this.
You should be like this,
you know,

502
00:26:40.171 --> 00:26:44.070
and some of those things hurt men.
Do you think we still do that?
Yeah,
we'll

503
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.250
<v 2>still put now expectations of what man,</v>

504
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.760
<v 4>I told him that do I think we might be lucky here in la?
You know,</v>

505
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:53.580
because we can sort of like live any way that we choose.
I mean,

506
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:57.930
you clearly live exactly how you want to live,
which is great.
Uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

507
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:02.730
and,
and I get to as well.
Uh,
but I think that,
uh,
you know,

508
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:06.420
we're,
we're lucky in that we're so self actualized,
you know what I mean?
That,

509
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.090
that maybe we face a little bit less pressure than,
than you know,

510
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:10.500
your average Joe across the country.

511
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.593
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

512
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.000
I don't know of anyone who's putting pressure on men to not be friendly with

513
00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:17.834
other men.

514
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.880
That seems so ridiculous to me to deny camaraderie.

515
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.860
Obviously in the military it's a huge aspect of military service as the

516
00:27:27.861 --> 00:27:32.660
Brotherhood,
but these guys form with each other.
And that's about,
uh,
you know,

517
00:27:32.661 --> 00:27:34.610
if you want to talk about traditional male values,

518
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:38.330
that's about as manly a thing as a person can do,
right.
Serve their country

519
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.300
<v 4>very much so.
Um,
but are like men for instance,</v>

520
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:46.620
and courage to be emotionally vulnerable with,
uh,
with their friends,

521
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.930
for instance.
Like I think that's something that's like,

522
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.140
<v 2>do it,
they'll going to bring it up when you argue.</v>

523
00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.460
<v 4>Yeah.
And so that's,
so that's the thing.
There's that,</v>

524
00:27:54.461 --> 00:27:57.220
there's a level of intimacy that were,
that were like,

525
00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.290
and that's sort of intimacy is what leads to long friendships,
you know,

526
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.250
that really,
really last,
right.

527
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.660
<v 2>It's a balancing act I think because I think there's,</v>

528
00:28:05.661 --> 00:28:09.200
there is intimacy and then there's also guys who were just being a bitch and

529
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.820
they need to learn how to man up.

530
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.210
I like this bull bull things or read things are real.

531
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.230
It is real to be intimate and to be vulnerable and to explain how you feel,

532
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.290
but then sometimes you shouldn't be just fucking complaining about things.

533
00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:24.650
You should figure your life out and man the fuck up and go do something.

534
00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:28.700
And it's not necessarily you being emotionally vulnerable as you like to say it

535
00:28:28.701 --> 00:28:32.270
in such a,
uh,
a normalizing way might,
it might just be being a bitch.

536
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.500
<v 4>Uh,
well to think that when you say that you put a little pressure on,
on</v>

537
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.000
<v 2>men at all to this,
I put pressure on men.
Yeah.
Well,
there you go.
Maybe you are,</v>

538
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.580
maybe you're the one putting a little pressure.
Yes,
they need some pressure.

539
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.700
I think most men need just a little bit of a motivational shove in the general

540
00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:50.140
direction of success and happiness.

541
00:28:50.141 --> 00:28:54.940
And a lot of that is overcoming laziness and implying or,

542
00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:58.840
uh,
applying some discipline to your life.
I think those things are,

543
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.260
let me manly attributes that turned out to actually be good for you.

544
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.750
<v 4>Uh,
you know,
I think there's a lot of,
uh,
I don't disagree with you about,</v>

545
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.940
about some of those aspects being good for you.
Um,
let,

546
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:10.770
let me just give one other example.
Um,

547
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.470
and I'm blanking on the name of this podcast.
Um,
I can,

548
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.220
I can look it up if you want,
but,
um,
uh,
very wonderful podcast about philosophy.

549
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.630
Um,
as far as this,
uh,
no,
I love philosophize.
This,
it's a different one here.

550
00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:23.880
I'll look up what it was,
um,
as I'm talking to you about it,

551
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:27.450
but I'm really wonderful podcast.
Uh,
where,
uh,

552
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.460
they were talking to this guy who was in the military,
um,
and uh,

553
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.010
his PTSD.
And he was talking about how the idea of,

554
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.130
of be a man,
right?
It was just a phrase that he would hear a lot in the military,

555
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.120
right?
Um,
and,
oh,

556
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:46.000
it's called hyphae nation is the name of the podcast and there's an episode

557
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:50.980
called Bia man hyphenation really wonderful podcasts about philosophy.
Um,
and,

558
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.410
uh,
it's was talking about that idea of Bia man,
right?
What does that mean in,

559
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.860
in the military?
And,
and look,
I'm just repeating with,
as in the podcast,

560
00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.460
I have no military experience myself.
I don't want to claim too,
but,
um,
uh,

561
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:04.540
and you know,
that means sort of like overcome adversity,
right?

562
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:06.280
Don't complain too much,
right?
If you have a problem,

563
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:09.460
solve it yourself kind of thing.
Right.
Um,
and he talked about,

564
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:11.800
and they also talked with the medical professionals who said the same thing,

565
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.380
that that idea,
um,
can,

566
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.370
doesn't give men the tools they need to deal with PTSD.
Right.

567
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.770
And can actually exacerbate PTSD because it means that they're not trained how

568
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:25.280
to reach out for help for those problems.
And so I think,

569
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.610
oh yeah,
it's a different example of,
of,

570
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.150
of just a way that that sort of narrow idea BIA man,
being a man means this.

571
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:34.420
A real man would do this,
right.
That does,
that works.

572
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:38.530
In some situations maybe that works when you're,
you know,
in a Foxhole,
right.
Um,

573
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.840
it doesn't work so well when you're out of it.
Right.

574
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.300
And so that's a narrow idea that can lead to a bad outcome.

575
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.310
<v 3>Sure.
But that's basically what we were just saying,
that you know,</v>

576
00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:50.660
you should be emotionally vulnerable and know how to express yourself with your

577
00:30:50.661 --> 00:30:53.060
friends and be honest and true about how you feel about things.

578
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.410
But you all should know when you're being a bitch.
Both of those things are real.

579
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:58.640
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

580
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.600
If you're on a hike with a friend and he has to stop every five minutes because

581
00:31:02.601 --> 00:31:06.830
his foot hurts,
like,
come on man,
my foot hurts to just fucking walk.

582
00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:09.210
You're walking fine.
I completely,
completely agree.

583
00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:10.880
We just don't think this is worth it.

584
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.660
This is not what I had in mind when we started hiking at guys beat a bitch,

585
00:31:14.661 --> 00:31:17.660
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He needs to man the fuck up.
Right.
But let me,

586
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.680
but I know you're hesitant to say,
man,
the fuck up because it was a woman.

587
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.120
What would you say you'd say,
toughen up.
Just soldier on,
what would you say?
Well,

588
00:31:26.121 --> 00:31:28.700
I don't think that the reason I'm hesitant to use that word is I don't think

589
00:31:28.701 --> 00:31:32.690
that being tough is exclusively a male.
Right.
That's why I said,

590
00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:34.990
if you're a woman,
what would you say?
Would you say tough enough?
Yeah,

591
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.330
I guess I went in the same situation.
You gotta toughen up.
You to deal with it.

592
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.660
Press on.
Yeah.
But men like to,

593
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.340
we like to equate that to one of our best attributes being a fucking man.

594
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.310
Cause I'm a fuck up the map.

595
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.300
<v 4>What if you're,
what if you're a on that walkway,</v>

596
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:59.420
on the hike with a friend and your friend is legit afraid of hikes I've been on

597
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:02.460
in France on the hikes with,
I'm sorry,
I didn't said hikes heights.

598
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.630
You can hike in with that dude.
And I went on a hike.

599
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.010
I went on a hike with a friend.
My friend had it.
We were in Zion National Park,

600
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.140
which has some very narrow,
that's each Utah.
Yeah.

601
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.670
My friend had had a panic attack.
Right.
Because,
because of the hike and it was,

602
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.020
and it was,
you know,
um,
and that's legit.
Right?
And thank God he was able,

603
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.320
he felt able to share it with me.
Right.
But if we,
you know,
so that's,

604
00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:29.490
so that's the balancing act of creating an environment where you're not,
hey,

605
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:32.730
yeah,
don't complain about your foot,
but hey,
if you're really in distress,

606
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.390
like you can share that with me.
And some men feel that they can't do that.

607
00:32:36.391 --> 00:32:39.620
And I remember when I was younger,
you know,
feeling I want to,

608
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.640
I really have this problem,

609
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:43.010
but I can't express that to my friends because they're going to make fun of me.

610
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.900
Right.
Um,
and that sucks.
And so my goal is to,

611
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:52.070
and what that segment that we did about manliness was about,
um,
was saying,
hey,

612
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:56.900
if you,
uh,
if you're a man and being a man to you means,
you know,
being confident,

613
00:32:56.901 --> 00:33:00.950
being assertive and stuff like that,
great qualities,
not that qualities at all.

614
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.980
Right?
But we want to expand the notion of manliness.

615
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:08.570
So it includes all the different ways that one can be a man.
Right?
Um,
uh,
that,

616
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.730
that is,
it's as wide as possible,
right?

617
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:13.700
So because of the problem is going to shut it down,
the expression manliness,

618
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:14.870
right,
that's the problem.

619
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.520
Cause manliness like instantly becomes handsome,

620
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:21.140
aggressive,
you know,

621
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:26.141
muscular cultural idea of a man and womanliness is more like soft and kind.

622
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.740
Yeah.
You know,
you don't think of it sexually,
right?
When you see,

623
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.270
you think of w w womanliness isn't really a word that's used,
but if it was yeah,

624
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.340
womanly,
that those are their cultural ideas that we associate with those things.

625
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:44.390
Right.
But I,
so,
so let me just give you my example.
I,
uh,

626
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.520
personally I love taking care of other people,
right.
With me and my,

627
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.800
me and my girlfriend,
we've been together 10 years.
Um,

628
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.240
one of the main things I love to do in our relationship is I really like cooking

629
00:33:56.241 --> 00:33:58.400
for her.
You know what I mean?
I like taking care of her.

630
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.510
That's like something that I enjoy.
Right?
Um,
uh,

631
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:06.830
that's the part of my manliness.
That's like how I am.
A man

632
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.220
feels good,
well food.

633
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:14.510
And you can sit down and do something for and cook for.

634
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.230
You can associate it with,
yeah.
Pr Providing,
providing goes back to that,

635
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.600
you know,
classic sort of,
uh,
Ma,
you know,
manly value you can associate with that.

636
00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:25.730
I'm not even saying in that sense,
there's nothing wrong with that word,

637
00:34:25.731 --> 00:34:29.420
but in that sense,
you,
you wanted give,
yeah,
exactly.

638
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.040
And that's not a value that I was brought up with of like,

639
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:37.370
that's a manly thing to do,
right.
Is to like,
be kind and be nurturing.

640
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.790
You know what I mean?
Um,
but,
uh,
it's something that I really,

641
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.080
that really means a lot to me.
Yeah.
It wasn't what I was brought up with.
Um,
and,

642
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:49.520
uh,
uh,
so to me it's important to like expand,
you know,

643
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.970
my notion of what it was really a big deal for me to like realize that that was

644
00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:57.110
part of what being a man was to me.
Um,
and I noticed that like,

645
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.200
you know,
uh,
for instance,
um,

646
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.980
like let's just take the example of like,
you know,
kids entertainment,

647
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:06.220
like growing up,
you know,
like kids cartoons and stuff like that.

648
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.410
Like the female characters are the ones who are taking care of other people and

649
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:11.420
the male characters are the ones who are kicking ass.
Right.

650
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:15.770
And I like kicking ass sometimes too,
but I realized,
uh,
at one point I was like,

651
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.500
oh,
I didn't have like models of that as a kid of like,

652
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:23.480
here's a man who takes care of other people emotionally or you know,

653
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.120
uh,
or in a caring way,
you know,
but to fill,
uh,

654
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:33.230
Dr Phil and he does it a little bit.
It does,
it does.
It does.

655
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.740
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
I mean,
whenever you have a label,
it,

656
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:38.340
especially a narrow label,

657
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.020
<v 2>it's a problem,
you know?
And I think,
uh,
the,
the,</v>

658
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:47.030
the idea of manliness or like what it entails and the problems that people would

659
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:50.970
have about that on the outside,

660
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.690
it's almost always problems that are being imposed on them.
Like,

661
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:57.510
or the ideas that are being imposed on them for people who don't like the way

662
00:35:57.511 --> 00:36:01.650
they live,
they don't like who they are or want to mock who they are,

663
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:03.870
how they live.
So if someone's too emotional,

664
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.820
if someone's too introverted instead of celebrating that or that guy's
different.

665
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.500
Cool.
Yeah.
Instead of that,

666
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:14.400
it's the bully a mocking and shitting on them.

667
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:16.150
The jock type behavior.
Yeah.

668
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.070
We associated it with being the negative aspect of masculinity.

669
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.700
Toxic masculinity is,
which is the phrase that gets tossed around.

670
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.160
But I think this is,
um,
you know,
this is a shitty humans.
I agree.
You know,

671
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.020
I mean,
that's really where the problem

672
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.990
<v 6>and it's not specific to,
it's not specific to men,
right?
It's definitely not,</v>

673
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.843
it's everybody.

674
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.260
But let me give you one more example just to get back to what you're talking

675
00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:42.630
about,
about body type and what people are attracted to.
I read this wonderful,
uh,

676
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.060
advice column.
Um,
uh,
it's this guy who is,
this guy doesn't device.

677
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.710
It's got a kind of silly names,
Dr Nerd love.
Um,

678
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.590
but he's doesn't really good advice column.
And this dude wrote in and said,
Hey,

679
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:57.670
I'm with a woman.
She's,
um,
you know,
a little bit bigger of a Gal,
you know,

680
00:36:57.671 --> 00:37:00.970
then I've dated in the past.
I really am into her.
She's so cool,

681
00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:04.390
but she's not my type.
I'm not normally into women like this.

682
00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:06.370
And that bothers me that she's not my type right.

683
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.430
Even though I'm into her so much,
she's not my type.
What do I do about that?

684
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:13.690
She's not my type.
And I loved this guy's answer.
He wrote back and he said,
dude,

685
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.830
she's your fucking type.
You like her,
right?
You're into her.

686
00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:19.720
You think she's a sexy woman,
right?

687
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.280
The problem is you are brought up in a world where it's not okay for men to like

688
00:37:24.281 --> 00:37:28.300
women like that.
It's not okay to,
to like women who are her size and you've,

689
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.170
you've ingested at your whole life and now you're hating yourself because you

690
00:37:32.171 --> 00:37:35.560
were told something that about what's okay for you to like and what's not okay

691
00:37:35.561 --> 00:37:38.440
for you to like,
and I really related to that,
you know,

692
00:37:38.441 --> 00:37:41.950
because I remember feeling that way about girls.
I dated like hold on a sec.
Oh,

693
00:37:41.951 --> 00:37:44.800
I'm into her so much,
but oh wait,
is she not?

694
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.500
Is she not like attractive?
Right.

695
00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:51.100
Am I wrong to be dating her because she doesn't fit what I,
you know,

696
00:37:51.101 --> 00:37:55.000
the sort of like set of parameters for what an attractive woman is.
Right.

697
00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.090
And so when you talk about what people say,
what people say they're attracted to,

698
00:37:58.091 --> 00:38:00.340
if you ask any woman,
what did she say she's attracted to this kind of man,

699
00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:03.550
if you ask any man wouldn't sit,
she's attracted to that kind of woman.
Yeah,

700
00:38:03.551 --> 00:38:04.810
they might say that.
Right?

701
00:38:04.811 --> 00:38:09.540
But deep down do they maybe have a desire that is not being,
you know,
that they,

702
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:13.370
that they've been told is wrong their whole lives.
Right.
Um,

703
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.750
and I really related to that,
I was like,
man,
that is really a good point.

704
00:38:16.751 --> 00:38:19.060
I have been told that my whole life and it has,

705
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.100
I've allowed it to control who I'm attracted to to a certain extent,
you know,

706
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.060
and that's a mental prison that I want to get out of,
you know,

707
00:38:28.061 --> 00:38:31.950
and you know,
now I have the benefit.
I'm a little bit older,
you know,
and I'm,

708
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:33.910
I feel like I'm in less mental prisons that I used to be.

709
00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:36.070
I feel like you're in no mental at all at

710
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.640
<v 5>all.
I feel like a lot of your listeners,
you know,
I've have broken out of him,</v>

711
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:40.360
you know,

712
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.980
but especially I think back about like when I was 16 years old and yeah,
I,

713
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.900
you know,
you're swimming in that shit and you don't know to question it.

714
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.580
You had a lot of the time.
And that's what our show is about,

715
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:52.480
is getting people to question those assumptions and those things that you're

716
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:55.540
being told without even realizing you're being told them.
Well,

717
00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:58.540
there is a problem with young men in their identities,

718
00:38:58.541 --> 00:39:03.541
like them wanting other people to think them as cool as cool.

719
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.120
Think of them as someone who's successful or someone who's doing well.

720
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.490
That's a weird thing to say.
You know,
I'm,

721
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:14.060
I'm really into her but she's not my type.
But you know,

722
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.570
the problem there seems to,
in my mind,

723
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:20.800
in my estimation seems this guy's worry too much about his identity.
Yeah.

724
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.640
Instead of just being who he is,
worried about his identity and,

725
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.680
and that's a really tough thing to get over.

726
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:28.780
And that's what we were trying to help people get over in that episode.

727
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:31.630
But you know,
when I think about in my,
you know,

728
00:39:31.631 --> 00:39:34.960
when I was getting started in comedy and my,
in my twenties,
you know,
um,

729
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:40.020
the amount of time I spent worrying before I went onstage about how,

730
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:42.370
what I was going to say I was going to come off.

731
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:45.610
It was if it was going to be cool or if I get made fun of by the other guys in

732
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:48.310
my comedy group or about like the other people at the open mic.
You know,

733
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.630
like I did,
I did she grow for years to come up in alt rooms.
Yeah.

734
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:56.380
The meanest mother fucker.
He sure.
Fucking art.
Super nerds.

735
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.660
Try it out and be like,

736
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.700
oh super progressive fucking mean do so God damn socially vicious,

737
00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.730
no toe.
Especially just at the open mics in New York City.
You know,

738
00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:09.530
it was a real way to say,
yeah,
yeah cause they're there.

739
00:40:09.531 --> 00:40:11.770
There's no like organization.
I didn't,

740
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.690
I never set foot in a club because I was like,

741
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:16.690
I don't want to deal with anybody at the club thinking oh I'm trying to get a

742
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:19.630
spot or whatever.
I was like,
I'm just doing bar shows,
open mic,
stuff like that.

743
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.610
And yeah,
there's no rules.

744
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:24.820
So it's just social enforcement and it's just people being like,
I'm the big dog.

745
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:25.630
Like,

746
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.810
and people would like cross their arms during other people's sets or like say

747
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:30.970
shit and like it really fucking sucked.

748
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.170
And the only way I got passed it by saying I don't give a shit about what I

749
00:40:34.171 --> 00:40:35.940
think of these motherfuckers think.
Yeah.
You know,

750
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.030
and I know I'm going to identify the people who I think are doing good work and

751
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:43.030
who I think are funny.
And then hopefully they laugh at me too.

752
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.290
I'm going to focus on that.

753
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:47.560
But you should look at the people that are crossing their arms with amusement

754
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.160
because all those fools fools,
I know what you're doing.

755
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.360
You're just throwing poison at people for no reason.
Totally.
You know,

756
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.410
especially in open mic nights and those kind of shows,
those bar shows,

757
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.260
people are just developing.
You know,

758
00:41:02.261 --> 00:41:05.440
you're watching little babies running around in nursery home.
I mean,

759
00:41:05.441 --> 00:41:06.490
that's really what it is.

760
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.760
And what they're trying to do with how many babies those people are trying to do

761
00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:12.850
is they're trying to say,
well,
I know the difference between good and bad,

762
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.620
and that's one of the reasons I'm good and so on.
You say that you're bad,
right?

763
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.680
That's bullshit.
It's bullshit.
And a lot of them aren't funny,

764
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.090
and that's a real part of the problem.

765
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.720
They're trying to enforce a narrow band of comedy because they think they can

766
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:27.220
operate inside those parameters.

767
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:30.150
But if they wanted to go on stage at the comedy store after Joey Diaz,

768
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.160
they'd burst into flames.
That's I'm really that good.

769
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.000
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
what you're doing is not that good.
I know you think you have a point,</v>

770
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:39.680
but what you're saying is not your art,
is it?

771
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:42.830
Not that I know that you listened to the [inaudible] podcast and you think that

772
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:45.770
makes you go in everybody,
but the number of people who'd be like,

773
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:47.570
well it billboard wouldn't do it like that or whatever.

774
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:51.710
Like that kind of thing is like so,
so off the off the charts

775
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.340
<v 2>vintagey you know it really is and the best,</v>

776
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.150
the best energy in the small groups,

777
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:04.151
the best way to use your energy is to appreciate good work and recognize bad

778
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:08.630
work and recognize maybe you have some of that aspect totally and yourself,

779
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:12.320
some some aspects of bad work and your own act and maybe you should trim it out

780
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:15.020
and look at yourself objectively.
The way you're looking at this person,

781
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:20.240
but the whole cross your arms and let someone stealing or doing something racist

782
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:25.190
or,
or,
or,
or,
or clearly fucked up socially,
you know,
like what do you care?

783
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.010
You care.
They just,
they just suck.
You suck too bro.

784
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.943
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

785
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.000
You're in the open mic at 11:00 PM you both of them went for three hours to do

786
00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:33.990
three minutes,
you know,

787
00:42:33.991 --> 00:42:37.410
so it's like your first couple of years on stage was terrible.

788
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.790
I want to go back and hug everyone who's ever in the audience and say,

789
00:42:41.791 --> 00:42:46.440
I'm sorry I didn't mean to put you through whatever the fuck I did up there.

790
00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.660
That 10 minutes of nonsense.
I'm sorry.
One time when I was doing open Mikes,

791
00:42:51.661 --> 00:42:54.210
I was doing,
I was doing three up on Mike's at night in New York,
you know,

792
00:42:54.211 --> 00:42:56.790
and I've kind of missed that.
I was like really fun.
It was like going to the gym,

793
00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.580
you know,
it's like bouncing around Bob up a pump,
but you know,

794
00:42:59.581 --> 00:43:01.620
you really get used to it.
And there was one night,

795
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:05.330
I can't remember why the hell this happened,
but my girlfriend and her friend,
um,

796
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.210
and they're both cartoonists.
My girl,
my girlfriend is a incredible,
uh,

797
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.040
cartoonists,
uh,
on her name's Lisa Hanawalt.
Um,
uh,
and so she's funny.

798
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.020
You know,
these are funny people for some reason were like,

799
00:43:16.021 --> 00:43:18.780
we want to come to the open mic at the creek and cave in New York.
I was like,

800
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:22.560
she do okay,
here we go.
And they sat there and they were like,

801
00:43:22.561 --> 00:43:25.020
we sat in the front row and they were like,
their,

802
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.140
their hands were like covering their eyes.
They were like,
oh,

803
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.960
like every single person because he,
what is he doing?
Oh my God,

804
00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:36.530
this person.
What were they thinking?
Like they were,

805
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.810
they was just like the worst freak show to them.
And I was like,
yeah,

806
00:43:39.811 --> 00:43:41.670
I do this every single night.
Like everything that,

807
00:43:41.671 --> 00:43:45.870
every shitty mistake or every weird thing that every person did that I was

808
00:43:45.871 --> 00:43:48.600
totally like blank to that I'd seen a million times.

809
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:52.680
They were like shocked by what was going on on that stage.
Um,

810
00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.210
and it made me really enjoy going to those mikes again cause it made me see for

811
00:43:57.211 --> 00:43:59.140
the first time,
you know,
like,
uh,

812
00:43:59.141 --> 00:44:03.390
made me fresh again to like how fucking weird I miss up a Mike so much because

813
00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:05.580
it's such a beautiful disaster,
right?
Cause you're right,

814
00:44:05.581 --> 00:44:09.180
every single person that goes up at an open mic is sweating.

815
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.720
W basically they're doing like,
they're like endurance training.

816
00:44:12.721 --> 00:44:15.870
Like they're doing something that is physically uncomfortable,

817
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.640
even socially terrible and they're bad at it and they're just doing it over and

818
00:44:20.641 --> 00:44:23.220
over again until they get used to it.
Um,

819
00:44:23.221 --> 00:44:26.520
so that they can just go up on stage without flop sweating.
You know,

820
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.510
like everyone just watching,
uh,

821
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.400
a hundred people in a row have panic attacks basically and people are just being

822
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:36.210
there weird fucking selves and you see a lot of nonsense.

823
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.510
And then you see a lot of people where you're like,
God damn,
that person is,

824
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.940
there is a core there and then they're going to be really fucking funny.

825
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:47.270
And I love the fact that I know so many people from those days,

826
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.900
we've just all grown up together.

827
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:52.230
And now they're all right in sitcoms or they're doing it.
You know,

828
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:56.430
I met Michelle Wolf our first week doing open mikes.
Um,

829
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.170
it was so cool.
We've met like,

830
00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.580
I was like my second open mic and it was like her third open mic and we saw each

831
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:05.010
other at her and a couple friends.
I was like,
you guys are funny.
You're funny.

832
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.960
And she was like,
yeah,
we're going to sit there.
Mike,
you want to come?
Yup,

833
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:07.441
let's go.

834
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:11.220
And then I've known her ever since and then like to see her do that white horse

835
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:13.680
core White House correspondence dinner was like,

836
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:17.430
I just felt all that history all at once.
I was like,
this is fucking amazing.

837
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:20.370
You know?
I was so what did you think when the president was tweeting at her?

838
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.840
I was like,
damn,
she got him on the hook.
I was like,

839
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.120
that's what a comic supposed to do.
You know,

840
00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:30.480
like the way that she pissed people off.
That was such a beautiful,

841
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.060
that was such a beautiful moment.
I loved it.

842
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:37.980
She was so fucking funny and great writing too.
It was great,
right?
Yeah.

843
00:45:37.981 --> 00:45:41.640
She wrote it,
a bunch of our friends from those days,
Anthony to veto Greg stone.

844
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:45.690
Dan Saint Germain I believe,
help to write jokes and yeah,
they were really funny.

845
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.890
And guess what?
Like the crowd didn't want comedy apparently,

846
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.720
but they got one of the best comics in the country.
You know who's like on that?

847
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.460
She's in her prime right now and she fucking tore it up.

848
00:45:56.461 --> 00:46:00.180
She did her job better than they wanted and they got pissed off about it and it

849
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:01.014
was,

850
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.520
it was like a three day news cycle of how much,

851
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.760
but everybody hated her were there,
didn't get pissed off.
Some of them,

852
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:11.430
they were like tweeting like Maggie Haberman for the New York Times was tweeting

853
00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:16.140
like,
oh I feel bad for,
you know Sarah Huckabee like for the,
for the,

854
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:16.441
you know,

855
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:20.550
light jab that she got about her high makeup that was smear break thing.

856
00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.230
It was nothing.
And they were talking about what they say shit,
appearance,
shamed.

857
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:30.560
She appearance sheet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I forget what it was.
She,

858
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.350
she got off light.
Everybody got off light.
Yeah,
that's great and fine.

859
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:37.860
But people forget when cold bear did that 10 years earlier and he was a

860
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.620
applauded for it.
The people in the room hated that too.

861
00:46:40.621 --> 00:46:41.730
If you go back and watch that video,

862
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:44.550
he gets no laughs when he's making fun of Bush,

863
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.110
one of the most famous like comedy appearances ever,
right?
Yeah.

864
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.500
And he got zero laughs in the room.
It's dead quiet.
It's bizarre if you watch it.

865
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.960
And then a year later it was like [inaudible] he's the master,
he did it,
Dah,
Dah,

866
00:46:55.961 --> 00:46:57.570
Dah.
That was one of the big moments for comedy,

867
00:46:57.571 --> 00:47:01.320
getting serious and like sat targeting that was a breakout for him and like the

868
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:03.450
political hacks in the room can't take it because they don't,

869
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:07.320
I don't know why they book comics because they do not want comedy and that's why

870
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:09.660
they,
I guess they're,
you know,
they're not going to book comedy anymore,

871
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.360
but here's an interesting cat man.
Yes,
yes.

872
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:15.750
A bunch of things rolled up into one because he's a,

873
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.460
he's a legitimate Catholic,
like,
yeah,
really Catholic.
Yeah.

874
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.840
Despite all the scandals and kid fucking and all the craziness.

875
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:30.020
And then on top of that,
he's this character,
but now he's not the anymore.
No.

876
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.120
Now he's like a guy who's not totally playing the character,

877
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:37.480
but the character comes in and out like little shadows.
Yes,
it does.

878
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.890
And it's like,
what are you,
what's your real thoughts on things?

879
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:45.100
Cause I know you as Cole Bear and know you from the Colbert report,

880
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:48.860
this hilarious fake Republican guy and now I'm seeing him.

881
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.440
I'm not sure what's going on here,
man.
Yeah.
I mean he's,
well,
and when you're,

882
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.310
when you're in late night,
you know,
I play a character on my show too.

883
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.040
That's like a heightened version of myself that's developed as like a very extra

884
00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:03.760
nerdy,
it's almost like me as peewee Herman,
a little bit like it's,
it's a,

885
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.840
it towards me is my younger self.
It's like very socially awkward.
I'm alone.
Oh,

886
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:09.400
sorry.
Like it's a lot of up there,
you know,

887
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.260
and it's different than what I do on stage.
Uh,
and uh,
you know,

888
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:17.230
I can only imagine,
even though he is still,
he's like,

889
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.570
his big thing for late night was like,
I'm going to be myself.

890
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.650
I'm not the character anymore.

891
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:25.630
You still build a little bit of a character for yourself,
you know also the him,

892
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:28.060
it's like that's what brought them to the dance.
Yeah.

893
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.470
The reason why you're there.
It's like what,

894
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:32.410
what kind of meetings that they have with him.
Like what are we going to do here?

895
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.490
I have this trait,
I ain't going to be gold bear.
I heard him say once,

896
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.140
he only said this in one interview,
but he was like,

897
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:40.900
we're basically creating a new character for late night.

898
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.560
And so he had the same writers from,
from the Colbert report.
And so,
uh,

899
00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:47.080
he was like,
we're sort of like creating a new character.

900
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:50.890
How does this character work?
But I got to say the old show,
I mean he's,

901
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:51.903
he's great.

902
00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.660
The old show was probably the best performance ever made by a single late night

903
00:48:55.661 --> 00:48:59.080
comics because the way that he,
when I watch it now,
if I go back and watch clips,

904
00:48:59.081 --> 00:49:03.480
I'm like the way he would do like three or four fast little turns,
you know,

905
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.950
single line where it would like mean one thing but there'd be some sub tax.

906
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.870
Then he would flip around and he would do it like it was like watching like a

907
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.960
figure skater do triple axles,
you know,
like watching him do that.
It was,

908
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.780
it was really impressive.
I liked the guy,
don't get me wrong,

909
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:21.160
but I like him more on the Colbert report and I'm like him as a late night talk

910
00:49:21.161 --> 00:49:22.510
show host.
But I do have to agree.

911
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:25.810
I think that's also my prejudice against that format.
I'm like,

912
00:49:25.811 --> 00:49:29.320
you guys just saw what Jack Parr did and kept going.
Totally.

913
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.470
It's the same goddamn thing.
But I understand why he couldn't do the cold,

914
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:35.290
but he did that show for like 10 years,
you know,
like he can't,
you can't do,

915
00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:37.060
there was a limited thing for him,
you know,

916
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:40.600
like he had that character and so he could only do what was in the box,

917
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:44.920
that character.
And so he's looking to do more and,
and I get it.
I also feel like,

918
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:47.800
man,
that Colbert report is more interesting than the late night show to me as a

919
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.290
comic.
And it was a comedy writing fan for sure.

920
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:53.830
Because the late night shows her just promotion shows,
that's all they are.

921
00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:58.150
All they are is,
Hey Adam,
here you have a book out.
Hey Mike,

922
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.120
tell us about your new show.
Here's our 10 minutes of comedy before that.

923
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:02.330
And then we do that.
Yeah.

924
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:07.750
It's basically like a version of a commercial and the w and the nightly thing is

925
00:50:07.751 --> 00:50:11.170
a prison,
you know,
because you can only talk about what happened that day.

926
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.560
So the smartest thing that you know,
John Oliver,
right?

927
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:17.290
He was up for the daily show.
He wanted to do the daily show.

928
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:19.500
He was John Stewart's pick for the daily show.
They said this in the,

929
00:50:19.501 --> 00:50:21.010
in the oral history book of the daily show.

930
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.700
And then comedy central didn't close the deal with Oliver and HBO came and said,

931
00:50:25.701 --> 00:50:28.100
do you want to do a show instead?
You know,
and John Stewart was like,
all right,

932
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:29.720
go with God.
And that's what John Oliver did instead.

933
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:32.960
So we living in that alternate reality from John Oliver Hosting the daily show.

934
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.920
Right?
And so the smartest thing I'll ever did was do weekly,

935
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:40.040
not daily because it lets him go wider.
Right.
If he was doing daily,

936
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:42.260
he would have to just talk about what happened that day.

937
00:50:42.261 --> 00:50:44.420
You don't have that much.
You don't guess what,

938
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.540
you can't have as much of a complete thought in 24 hours or in realistically the

939
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:52.430
six hours you have between when you show up.
But when you take the shuttle,
right,

940
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.650
you can't say as much [inaudible] it's harder.
And so being on that,

941
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.620
you know,
weekly schedule and he's only doing 30 something shows a year,
right?

942
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.470
Cause they have hiatuses.
That's what allows them to have those big,

943
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:06.590
long complete thoughts that everyone likes so much.
You know,
these ramps,

944
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:12.620
intelligent takes your news issues and pointing out hypocrisy.
Our show,

945
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:16.220
it takes us,
we,
it takes us like three or four months to write an episode.

946
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:18.560
Like we're writing 16 at once,
but like,
you know,

947
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:19.940
that's how long we have to think about it.

948
00:51:19.941 --> 00:51:21.920
And so we're able to take twists and turns,
you know,

949
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:25.220
we go into it thinking this is going to be our angle and then we're,

950
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.010
we're diving into the research.
We have a wonderful research staff and they say,

951
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:31.600
actually this is the more interesting part of the story and then we are,

952
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:35.090
have the time to go chase it that way instead.
Right.

953
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.100
Whereas if we were on a daily schedule,
oh shit.

954
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:40.570
Well we don't have time to pivot because we got a show to make.
Right.

955
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:44.400
You ever feel time constraints in terms of like the subject matter,

956
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:48.050
the subject matter,
like very,
very involved.
Yeah,
I mean,

957
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:51.860
we try to do the most difficult topics.
We can't,
you know,

958
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:53.670
we don't hold back from anything.
Um,

959
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.480
but the only constraint that we have is that the show,

960
00:51:56.481 --> 00:52:00.380
we've got 21 minutes and then in,
but we got commercials.

961
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.440
So we only talk about some for six minutes before we have to move on.
Right.

962
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.370
And so that's the,
that's the only limitation that we have.

963
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.140
Like the network will let us do anything.

964
00:52:09.141 --> 00:52:11.630
We've been on the show for weed on the network for four years.

965
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.150
The only time you've ever killed a show was we want to do something about the

966
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:17.870
Ncaa,
about how the NCAA shouldn't kill,
I shouldn't kill,
sorry.

967
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.180
Shows us how it should pay athletes.
Right.
Well,

968
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:22.920
in the case of football and just going there,
but yeah,

969
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:24.130
we'd talk about that all the time.

970
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:28.400
I think it is one of the craziest fucking scams in,
in all of money,

971
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:32.780
let it college sports or it's unbelievable.
Making so much money off those kids.

972
00:52:32.781 --> 00:52:35.860
When you watch those things,
every single person's getting paid,
you know,

973
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.420
everybody's getting paid.
The Guy,
best players,

974
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:43.190
the guy bringing water to the announcers are getting paid except for the
players.

975
00:52:43.191 --> 00:52:46.490
Right.
So,
and the guy who literally,
I'm blanking on his name,

976
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:50.990
but the guy who created the system,
right,
who like formed the NCAA layer.

977
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:54.110
When he left,
he compared it to plantation slavery.
He was like,

978
00:52:54.111 --> 00:52:56.060
this is like slavery.
What I invented,
you know,

979
00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:00.440
there's no justification for it at all.
It is a banana's.
Uh,

980
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.670
we want to do that topic for a college episode.
We pitched that to true TV.

981
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.690
Uh,
you know what errors on true TV every march,
March madness,
March madness.

982
00:53:09.691 --> 00:53:13.370
And they said no.
They said,
they said,
and here's,
here's how I live with myself.

983
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.080
I say,
look,

984
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.370
I will never take a no until it's the only absolute answer I can get.

985
00:53:19.371 --> 00:53:23.180
So they said,
no.
I say,
I really want to do it.
Tell me know again.
You know,

986
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.460
they told me no again.
I was like,
if the president of the network tells me no,

987
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.100
then I'm not doing it.
And the president of network told me no,

988
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.890
because that's the guy who I could write it and he could tell the episodes.

989
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:36.400
<v 2>Well,
that's true.</v>

990
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:40.990
I shouldn't have NCAA on.
You're worried about.
They're worried about pissing off,

991
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:45.310
not just the NCAA.
Yeah.
Piss off those money grubbing thieves,

992
00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.340
athletic kids.
I'm with you.

993
00:53:48.341 --> 00:53:50.800
All these people are paying money to see those fucking kids.

994
00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.920
That shit drives me crazy exploiting of young athletes in college.

995
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:57.220
His workers.

996
00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:00.580
It is one of the ones that drives me because I got into it with Joey Diaz who

997
00:54:00.581 --> 00:54:01.271
explained to me,

998
00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:04.210
cause Joey used to be a bookie and he really understands gambling.

999
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.930
He was explaining to me how much money gets donated to the schools,

1000
00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.500
but people who used to go to them heels.
It's insane.
Yeah.
And he sent,

1001
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:16.570
and most of it is based on the performance that the school has in college sports

1002
00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.830
and these people who are,
you know,
I'm a fucking,
you know,
Blah Blah Blah.

1003
00:54:20.831 --> 00:54:24.280
I went to school there and I'm there at all.
I die,
I fucking go team.

1004
00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.580
These assholes throw shit.
Tons of money.

1005
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:32.320
And there's thousands of them all throughout history,
years and years.

1006
00:54:32.321 --> 00:54:35.020
Guys have been donating for 25 fucking years.
Yup.

1007
00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.260
<v 4>And when the team wins the championship,
they give him a bonus doing even more,</v>

1008
00:54:38.261 --> 00:54:40.440
right?
Yes,
but who doesn't get the money as the kid

1009
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.300
<v 2>king?
People who play the game,
all they have to do so well.</v>

1010
00:54:44.301 --> 00:54:45.051
If you go through here,

1011
00:54:45.051 --> 00:54:48.350
you're going to do education and then you're good to go to pro sports.

1012
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.830
How many of them make it,
especially in football,
almost none.
Almost none.

1013
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.720
But look at what are the numbers?
What is it like?

1014
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:57.560
I wonder what the numbers are guys who sign up for college football,

1015
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.390
who make it first of all,

1016
00:54:59.391 --> 00:55:04.391
with a body that's functional after four years of 600 fucking pound,

1017
00:55:05.211 --> 00:55:10.100
dude slamming that big giant,
giant dude slamming into you.

1018
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:10.973
You know fun.

1019
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:14.830
<v 4>We did.
We did an episode on football and the concussion to Emma's,</v>

1020
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:18.090
not just concussions,
right?
It's like just the little hits,
right?

1021
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:20.280
It's just the routine tackles.
You know what I mean?

1022
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.980
What happens every single time you do that,
your brain,

1023
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.820
you got to think of it this way.
Your brain is riding your,
your skull is the car.

1024
00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.910
Your brain's a passenger.
Your brain doesn't have a seat belt,
right?

1025
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.340
Every time you run into somebody,
boom,

1026
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:35.850
your brain slides forward a little bit cause it's not wearing a seatbelt bumps

1027
00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:37.710
into the front of your skull and bounces back,
right.

1028
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.100
And even if that doesn't cause a concussion,
it causes a little,

1029
00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:43.050
a little hurt every single time,
right?

1030
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.290
And so you can never get a concussion do that over and over and over again,

1031
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:50.850
and you're going to end up with CTA.
And so of trauma happens and soccer players,

1032
00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.440
yeah,

1033
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.810
sandy gets you in soccer and those kids or those kids are hurting themselves,

1034
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.240
you know,
uh,
and they're not getting paid for it.

1035
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.360
<v 2>Jamie wrote here in football out of 73,557 NCAA presents a fence.</v>

1036
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:09.440
Approximate number of who are draft eligible is down to 16,346 and now down to

1037
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:11.220
draft picks,

1038
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:16.220
it's 256 [inaudible] 56 out of 73,000 make it to draft

1039
00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:23.730
<v 4>1.6% make it from the NCAA to the 1.6%</v>

1040
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:26.703
<v 5>ridiculous.</v>

1041
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:31.830
Ncaa to major pro 1.6% that is fucking crazy.

1042
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:35.340
Let's be honest,
these kids are not getting a full education as POWs.

1043
00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:39.220
Baseball is almost 10% way more teams with like miners and all that kind of

1044
00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:43.290
crazy though.
That's wild.
So what 10% that's weird.
Well the though,
but that's,

1045
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.880
oh that's 10% of from draft eligible to drafted the major banks,

1046
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:48.510
not even the participants because look that's,

1047
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.640
that's a 35 k seven seven K or draft eligible and then seven joint seven are

1048
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:55.240
drafted.
Right,

1049
00:56:55.241 --> 00:56:59.730
but look how low the number is in terms of baseball participants versus
football.

1050
00:56:59.731 --> 00:57:03.970
It's half less than half and yet they have way higher percentage.

1051
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.060
This is our writing consults.
We look at charts also.

1052
00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:10.870
The thing is like with baseball you don't get hit right unless you get hit by a

1053
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:11.590
ball.

1054
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:15.280
Most of the time your injuries just from running or sliding and stuff like that.

1055
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.140
Yeah.
You're not going to hit that well.
You can get,
yeah,

1056
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:20.440
you can get hit in the head with a baseball.
So much safer.

1057
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.450
If I had a kid and the kid was thinking like baseball,
football,
or basketball,

1058
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:27.520
I'd be like,
we'll take that foot ball out of the fucking equation.

1059
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:30.430
You've got two choices.
It was don't do it.
Just don't do it.

1060
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:32.390
You're not going to make it.
No.

1061
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.670
The very few people that make it out of there without like serious injury,

1062
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.010
it's like,
it's not worth it.
It's just not.

1063
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.210
Especially if you look at that 75,000 number,
if you look at,
uh,

1064
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.290
for how many kids are playing in the NCAA now think about how many kids were

1065
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.150
playing high school football.
I don't know the number,

1066
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:50.490
but it's gotta be 10 times that.
Right.

1067
00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:52.420
<v 7>This kid is going to be,</v>

1068
00:57:52.421 --> 00:57:56.080
he's the Heisman trophy winner and he already has been drafted to the major

1069
00:57:56.081 --> 00:57:56.914
league baseball,

1070
00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.230
but he's also projected to potentially be in a top five NFL picks.
Whoa.

1071
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.750
So there's like a big discussion on what should he do?
It's up to him obviously,

1072
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:06.630
but players like Deion Sanders,

1073
00:58:06.631 --> 00:58:09.100
who I've been in both leagues and I've done both at the same time.

1074
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:10.660
It's like play baseball.

1075
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:14.570
<v 5>Wow.
Oh Man.
Well that's better for your life because you're less,</v>

1076
00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:19.460
you're less likely to,
to like,
yeah,
I have brain damage.

1077
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.100
Do you ever talk to a fucking baseball player that's retired?

1078
00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.830
It's like talking to a regular person.
He still does.

1079
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.180
He still wants to be the quarterback,
not going to be a basketball player.

1080
00:58:29.181 --> 00:58:31.190
Those guys clearly have the best of it.

1081
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:34.670
Like out of all the major sports basketball players because they,

1082
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.520
I don't know about that because it's a much more grueling schedule.

1083
00:58:37.521 --> 00:58:42.020
Physically you're running and shooting every night,
you're sprinting,

1084
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:45.200
you're doing all these different things.
Baseball is so much more leisurely,

1085
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:49.460
but the celebrity aspect of basketball is so huge and like in baseball,

1086
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.570
baseball should I can't he rod and it's still theirs.

1087
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:56.570
<v 7>Five,
10 min,
Max,
10 guys on the court.</v>

1088
00:58:56.571 --> 00:58:58.400
And if you do anything cameras right on your face.

1089
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.490
<v 5>Yeah.
Versus like the head of home ground baseball.
This was pointed out to me,</v>

1090
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.430
the website deadspin did this thing where they were like pointing out the

1091
00:59:05.431 --> 00:59:07.470
problem with baseball today.
They went around,
they ask people,

1092
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.500
hey can you name or what's the most famous baseball player that you could name?

1093
00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.760
And people were like Derek Jeter,
a rod,
big Papi,
Manny,
Manny Ramirez,

1094
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:18.510
retired guys.
And if you ask people,
they could,
men,
if they're a baseball fan,

1095
00:59:18.511 --> 00:59:21.710
they'd say someone from my team or maybe they'd say Mike Trout or say one of the

1096
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:22.850
guys in the Yankees.
Right.

1097
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.330
But there is no a rod Jeter like level celebrity right now.
What happened?

1098
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.400
I don't know exactly.
I can't give him back the steroids.

1099
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:35.720
No one's getting hurt.
What the fuck is the problem?

1100
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.600
We're not talking about fighting.
We're talking about baseball.

1101
00:59:38.601 --> 00:59:39.650
Give him the steroids.

1102
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.740
The best part about that stupid games with someone hits the ball.

1103
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:46.430
Does the steroids make them hit the ball better?
Yes.
Okay.
Well give it to him.

1104
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.650
The fuck are you guys doing testing for that?

1105
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:52.820
Performance enhancing drugs man are the craziest the debate about that.

1106
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:55.680
We've never done this on the show because I so I'm not like um,

1107
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:57.470
you shouldn't fully boned up.
I would like to,

1108
00:59:57.471 --> 01:00:00.800
I've thought about it in the past cause cause the,
the divisions,

1109
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.660
it's like the rest of the drug war,
right?

1110
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.500
The divisions we make between the things that are acceptable and not acceptable

1111
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:11.330
are so arbitrary.
Right?
So the example I always use is like,
okay,
why don't,

1112
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.100
why don't we like it?
Performance enhancing drugs.

1113
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.380
Not everyone has access to them.
So they're unfair,
right?

1114
01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.330
There are bad for your health and we think they're unnatural.
Right?
Okay.
So,
yeah,

1115
01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:21.730
there,
yeah,
there.
Yeah.
Well that's,

1116
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.890
those are the reasons why we think they're cheating.
Right?
Well,
it's also,

1117
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:27.260
but there are some drugs you can take that aren't cheating,
right?

1118
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.980
Like you could take a,
the reason why it's cheating.
That's the primary reason.

1119
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:35.700
So here's,
so let me give you a counter example.
Um,
uh,
for runners,
right?
Uh,

1120
01:00:35.701 --> 01:00:39.200
for endurance athletes like me,
I like running.
I'm a shitty runner,
but I like it.

1121
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:44.030
I think it's a fun sport.
Um,
so I follow it a little bit.
Uh,
so runners,
endurance,

1122
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.910
you know,
the big thing is like how much you're,

1123
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:50.540
how much oxygen your blood can hold,
right?
If you train at a high altitude,

1124
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:52.970
then you can increase that.
Right?
So there are these runners,

1125
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.140
the American runners,
right?
They live at a high altitude,
they live super high up,

1126
01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:01.400
you know,
in Colorado or whatever.
Right.
And then when they're not there,

1127
01:01:01.401 --> 01:01:02.510
they train,
they're all year round.

1128
01:01:02.511 --> 01:01:04.580
They buy a place there and then when they're not there,

1129
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:05.450
when they're competing somewhere else,

1130
01:01:05.451 --> 01:01:10.160
they sleep in a chamber that simulates low altitude.
Right.

1131
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.120
How is that not the same thing as taking a performance enhancing drug?
Like they,

1132
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.830
they,
you know,
it's not a,
it's not illegal to do that.
Right,
right.
It's unnatural.

1133
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.220
Right?
It is an unfair advantage because not everybody can afford one of those

1134
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:24.860
chambers.
And I'm not gonna say it's bad for your health,
I don't know.

1135
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:28.490
But it's certainly as weird for your body has taken a drug,
I would think.
Right.

1136
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.980
So why it's not because it's only like living at altitude.

1137
01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:37.460
It's really just simulates low altitude.
It's not like taking EPO,

1138
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:40.880
which would be the drug that would simulate that,
which I've got recent,
uh,

1139
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.550
experience with,
not personally,
but because of the UFC.

1140
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:48.400
Just had one of its champions stripped because of testing positive for EPO.

1141
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:52.650
And then we're just finding out now they don't test for EPO in everybody that

1142
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.630
it's very expensive.

1143
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:57.160
And so they do it based on the athlete's biological passport and what they think

1144
01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:59.420
are changing variables that,
you know,

1145
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.530
for whatever reason it triggers their,
their interest.
Yeah.

1146
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:08.690
We start testing additionally,
it's a big deal.
It's a,
it's a,
it's a serious drug.

1147
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.480
I mean it's a serious endurance drug but also has some serious health

1148
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:14.060
complications.
People have died from taking it.

1149
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:19.300
A young guys in their twenties and cycling have gotten strokes and died from

1150
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.303
EPA,

1151
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.750
<v 3>but there's no health negative effects of sleeping at altitude.</v>

1152
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:29.010
It's just can you afford to live there?
Can you grab route your life?
No,

1153
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.040
if you can't,
yeah,
it's an advantage for that person over you.

1154
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.790
So I'm just saying we have a,
we have sort of an ar,

1155
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:38.850
like it's sort of an arbitrary where we're drawing the lines is not consistent

1156
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.930
and it's kind of that,
that is a big one.
The,
that in terms of uh,

1157
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.850
the impact on endurance,
it is a big one.

1158
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.580
They're actually saying now that they think the best um,

1159
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.060
best course of strategy is to train at low altitude and then sleep at high

1160
01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:54.234
altitude.

1161
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.860
They think that when you train at low altitude you have more output so you're

1162
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:02.430
putting in more repetitions because you get more oxygen so you have more work

1163
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:07.560
and then you get the same effect by living at altitude.
So you get,

1164
01:03:07.561 --> 01:03:10.950
you get up there and sleep and you don't have to train up there and if you train

1165
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:11.191
up there,

1166
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:15.150
it's actually slightly less valuable than training at low altitude and staying

1167
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:17.260
up there damn.
Cause whatever I'm whenever,

1168
01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:19.330
whenever I'm stands and where High Alto,

1169
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.010
like I just did a weekend in Denver and I was like going on a run up there and

1170
01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:26.190
it was like obviously torture compared to like being here in la.
But I was like,

1171
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.730
oh I'm getting strong cause I'm running at high altitude.
That's not true.

1172
01:03:29.731 --> 01:03:32.400
That really fucks with me.
Well you just really need something from me.
Thank you.

1173
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.710
It's work and it will help you,

1174
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:39.960
but it's if you're a nap like athletes or we're literally working for one or 2%

1175
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:40.600
of an advantage.

1176
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.600
Occasionally on many occasions when you are living at high altitude and training

1177
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.780
at sea level,

1178
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:53.760
they think that that gives you a slight advantage because you can put more work

1179
01:03:53.761 --> 01:03:55.470
in,
especially for fighters,

1180
01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.390
they think that skilled work and repetitions and drilling is one of the most

1181
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:03.780
important aspects of it.
And you can just simply get in more repetitions,

1182
01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.560
you can get in more drills.
Hmm.
Yeah.
But they,
you know,

1183
01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:11.370
again though you're right cause this is sort of a performance enhancing thing.

1184
01:04:11.371 --> 01:04:16.230
You're not just living and just being yourself and then showing up and

1185
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.010
competing.
Yeah.

1186
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:21.480
You are engaging in this activity that re significantly raises your red blood

1187
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:26.160
cells significantly raises your oxygen capacity,
Changes Your Cardio,

1188
01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.420
your vo two Max changes.
Yeah.
Here's,
here's the word that it's just,
just this,

1189
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.660
there's this weird idea in sports and look,
you know,

1190
01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.330
Shit love more about athletics cause then I do,
it's not my,

1191
01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.430
it's not my real forte,
but I,
you know,
I do enjoy it.

1192
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.690
And the thing that's always weird to me is that we have this idea that like

1193
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:44.710
there's some kind of level playing field that the,

1194
01:04:44.711 --> 01:04:47.400
there's this like baseline human that we can just say,
well,

1195
01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:50.060
you've got to be at the baseline,
right?
Yeah.
And humans are so variable.

1196
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.720
You're always going to find these weird cases.

1197
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.990
And when you try to adjudicate it gets really weird.
Like,
do you know about,

1198
01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:58.960
you know,
casters Romania?
You know who she is?
No.
Uh,
oh no.
I do know this.

1199
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:02.300
Do I tell this story?
This story pisses me off so much.
So she's a mess.

1200
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.700
She's not a marathon,
right?
She's a middle distance runner.
I believe she's south,

1201
01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:10.650
South African.
Um,
she's like the best in the world at the 200 meters.
You know,

1202
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:14.760
I actually got to see her because,
uh,
my,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1203
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:18.040
I went to the Prefontaine classic in Eugene,
Oregon with my

1204
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.980
<v 4>dad to like watch the big track meet,
you know,
best in the world.
People,</v>

1205
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.340
this is like a Olympics,
you know,
not qualifier,

1206
01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:26.800
but it's like the Olympic caliber athletes saw her.
She's incredible.

1207
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:31.420
Just like one of the best in the world.
She's got,
um,
a,

1208
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.010
uh,
uh,
she,

1209
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:37.870
her whole life has faced accusations that she,
uh,
that her,

1210
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.620
that she's a man basically,
um,

1211
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.250
because she has like an elevated level of testosterone or,

1212
01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:45.940
and this is our natural body,
right?
And so she's had to deal with people saying,

1213
01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.550
oh,
we gotta,
we gotta do a sex check on you,

1214
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:52.080
which is humiliating and like also completely unscientific,
you know,
like what,

1215
01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:56.890
what are they going to do?
Um,
and uh,
one look at her genitals.
Well,

1216
01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:58.510
here's the weird thing man,
is that yeah,

1217
01:05:58.511 --> 01:05:59.950
they want to look at her genitals first of all,

1218
01:05:59.951 --> 01:06:02.290
which is humiliating to have that happen.
If you're an athlete,
you're like,

1219
01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:06.070
the people have to be in the room.
This is the problem,
right?

1220
01:06:06.071 --> 01:06:09.100
How do you judicate that?
Right,
right.
And also,
there's such a thing,

1221
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:11.440
I don't know anything about her personal situation.
Right.

1222
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:13.330
There's such a thing as Intersex people,
right?

1223
01:06:13.331 --> 01:06:16.150
Where when you look at the generals,
you can't tell.
It's not like,
hey,

1224
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.140
just look at their junk.
And you can tell,
right,
this is a real phenomenon.

1225
01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:22.560
Like 1% of people are Intersex,
right?
Isn't that high?
Uh,

1226
01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.040
I was speaking off the top of my head,
but it's higher than you think.
You know,

1227
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:28.300
it's definitely hard.
It's a nonzero number of people,
right?

1228
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:32.950
Intersex people are a real thing.
Um,
and so,
uh,
so,

1229
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.050
but so she got past that,
right?

1230
01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:37.690
They stopped challenging whether she was like a man or a woman.

1231
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:41.700
They did it by Amazon Test Center.
Uh,
I think you might be right.
Yeah.
Um,

1232
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.460
but so she's,
she's had a deal with that.
That's not fair.
Right?

1233
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:49.690
She's a physical cause,
a physical outlier.
And now the IAF,

1234
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.560
which is the organization that runs all,
it's like FIFA for track,
right?

1235
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:57.070
They run all track.
They have tried to put forward a rule.

1236
01:06:57.071 --> 01:06:59.640
I don't know what the status is right now because it's being challenged.
But,
um,

1237
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.320
they've tried to put forward a rule that says if you have a testosterone level

1238
01:07:02.321 --> 01:07:03.190
over a certain amount,

1239
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:08.191
you have to take a hormone changing to change your hormones and she's going to

1240
01:07:08.411 --> 01:07:09.244
fall under that.

1241
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:13.960
And so they literally want to change the body that she was born with because

1242
01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:18.730
they're saying your body is unfair to her.
How fucked up is that?
Right.

1243
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:21.030
That's crazy.
It's really,
really fucked up.
And,

1244
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:24.520
and so the thing is when we make those decisions about what's fair and what's

1245
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:28.840
not fair,
there's no baseline.
Human is always a value judgment.

1246
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:31.480
And when we're excluding some people,
that's almost all,

1247
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.640
we always need to look at that and say,
are we discriminating?

1248
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.940
They're definitely discriminating against Castro,
Romania.
And is this the IOC?

1249
01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:40.150
That's what does doing this?
And what does the IAA f which is the IOC,

1250
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:42.380
is the Olympics Iaf.
The Olympics aren't doing this,

1251
01:07:42.381 --> 01:07:45.220
so they don't have an issue with her.
I don't know what the Olympic policy is.

1252
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:47.230
The Olympics is fucked up.
We had a whole episode on the Olympics.

1253
01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:50.380
The Olympics is fucked up in a lot of ways too dirty,
dirty,
dirty,

1254
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:53.920
oh incredibly Darlene's of dollars off those athletes who worked for free.

1255
01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:58.960
We had this dude on a shot put guy who uh,
gold medalist in the shot put.

1256
01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:03.820
He was like the year I had a gold medal,
I was not able to pay my bills,
you know.

1257
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:08.260
Um,
and he is literally trying to like unionize the athletes,
which is very hard,

1258
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.020
right.
Cause there's new athletes every four years.
But yeah,

1259
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:12.220
those athletes are not paid.

1260
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.620
Plus no one's going to listen to the guy who throws the heavy roles.

1261
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.830
<v 5>What do you do?
Do you want a hundred meters?
Yeah,</v>

1262
01:08:18.831 --> 01:08:22.850
I got a gold medal for the hockey to hook a cannon ball.
I'll use throw a rock.

1263
01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.500
We're that you can't make a living throwing rocks,
dude.
Sorry.

1264
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.530
It's fucked up though because people watch those people watch the sports,

1265
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:34.320
you know the most fucked up things when they let the NBA play.
Yeah.

1266
01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:38.630
They left the NBA play get something.
Yeah.
Poor Eastern block nations.
Yeah.

1267
01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.180
You've got these fucking,
you know,

1268
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.510
super athletes who are professional American and they literally like all players

1269
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.320
for the,
for the biggest ones,
they can,
um,
uh,
you know,
get spa.

1270
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:51.160
Michael Phelps can just,
can you get a sponsorship right?
For the biggest one,

1271
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:51.910
the biggest ones,

1272
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:55.880
but the lower ones can't get sponsorships and like the put people can't get

1273
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.970
sponsorships and they're also not even allowed to promote themselves using the

1274
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:02.150
Olympics.
They can't be like,
Hey,
pizza place.
You know,
I'll be,

1275
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.390
I'll be on an Olympic athlete.
Me,
you know,
and the pizza place,

1276
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.680
because if they use the word Olympics,
the IOC will sue them.
Geez.
So yeah,

1277
01:09:09.681 --> 01:09:14.060
it's really,
really,
really not fair.
It's so prestigious.

1278
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.600
If you can win a gold medal in the Olympics,
I mean,
you basically can,

1279
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:22.760
you have a fitness career for life.
Yeah.
But well,
you could figure it out.

1280
01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.340
You're going to be a high school coach for the rest of your life depending on

1281
01:09:25.341 --> 01:09:29.040
the sport,
depending on the sport.
Right?
Like shot put a shot,

1282
01:09:29.041 --> 01:09:31.610
but I don't know what your prospects are.
Right.
Um,
fuck bro.

1283
01:09:31.611 --> 01:09:35.870
You're throwing rocks.
Something that people enjoy,
like track.

1284
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.190
I like track and field,
which sucks.

1285
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:40.040
Has is one of the dirtiest of all the sports but it's my favorite one to watch.

1286
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.740
Why is that a part of track and field?
The rock throwing part.

1287
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:47.090
How the fuck he has a track or field.
What are you doing?

1288
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.660
Are you a human catapults?

1289
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.210
Are you at the top of a need of the dude that they put on the top of the bridge

1290
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:57.870
for a rock?
I like this where someone has to like ride a horse then shoot a gun,

1291
01:09:57.871 --> 01:10:01.450
then go for a swim the old time.
Shut it.
Yeah.

1292
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:05.540
There's some stupid fucking sports in the Olympics.
Sorry my Canadian friends.

1293
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:06.423
But curling,

1294
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.360
curling is the top of the heap currently is getting bigger and bigger.

1295
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.720
The postures,
they don't have Jujitsu in the Olympics and they don't know.
Okay.

1296
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:14.760
That's fucked up.
Yeah.

1297
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.260
Retired NFL guys currently trying to make the curling team that just based off

1298
01:10:18.261 --> 01:10:21.050
of a bet that he'd made with his drunk buddies.
Like I bet I could do it.

1299
01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.220
That he could do it for sure.
Having a tough time actually.
Cause that they are,

1300
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.450
but like the drunk didn't,
not even try trying.
It's just the,
you know,

1301
01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:32.930
the systems we use to organize these things are so important.
You know,

1302
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:35.240
it's like so much more about like,
here's a really good example of this.

1303
01:10:35.241 --> 01:10:38.420
I thought this is fascinating.
Like,
um,
India,
right?

1304
01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.060
A country of over a billion people,
right?

1305
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.660
Huge number of people has almost no Olympic athletes.
Right.

1306
01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:49.680
And I'm like the first guy wrestlers don't of wrestlers,
I'm not sure,
but the,

1307
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:51.650
I remember this because a couple Olympics ago,

1308
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:56.750
the first individual gold medalist ever from India won a gold medal and he

1309
01:10:56.751 --> 01:11:00.710
wanted an air pistol,
which is like a shooting.
That's my shit shooting.
Oh yeah.

1310
01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:03.360
No,
I had never heard of it before.
Right.

1311
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.760
He's independently wealthy and had just practiced and practiced and practiced.

1312
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.450
What they don't have is India is,
it's a great country.

1313
01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:14.220
It's not a very organized country.
They have a lot of infrastructure

1314
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.920
<v 4>in terms of,
you know,
we've got teams,
right?</v>

1315
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.290
Whereas in the U s we devote tons of money,
government money,

1316
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:23.490
private money to like,
you know,
the swimming us swimming,

1317
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.510
billions of dollars,
people training science,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1318
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.960
In India they don't have that,
right?
Right.

1319
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:31.920
So despite the fact that they have so many people,
they got a billion people,

1320
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.380
they must have every time.
They must have one of the world's strongest people.

1321
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:36.840
They must have won the world's fastest people cause they got a billion people.

1322
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:40.020
Right.
What they don't have is that training infrastructure,
right?

1323
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.480
So if you look at it that way,
you're like,
okay,
hold on a second.

1324
01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:45.990
We don't like performance enhancing drugs because unearned unfair advantage.

1325
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:49.500
Well,
what else is training infrastructure than an unfair advantage?

1326
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.710
If you're born in the u s you have a way better chance of making it to the

1327
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:55.050
Olympics and becoming that greatest athlete in the world and someone in the,

1328
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.270
in India,
how is that fair?
How is that not an unfair advantage?
You know?

1329
01:11:58.290 --> 01:11:59.170
That's true.
But

1330
01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:00.760
<v 3>to play devil's advocate,</v>

1331
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:03.520
if you were state sponsored athlete from Russia or China,

1332
01:12:03.521 --> 01:12:05.440
you have a much better than you do.

1333
01:12:05.441 --> 01:12:08.630
If you're an American and you're some shotput put dude who doesn't have a way to

1334
01:12:08.631 --> 01:12:10.980
make a living in total you bills while you're working for the Olympics,

1335
01:12:10.981 --> 01:12:12.790
you totally do.
So my point is there's no right

1336
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.940
<v 4>baseline human like there's no,</v>

1337
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.680
there's no way to eliminate all advantages and never,
you know,
and just say,

1338
01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:22.400
oh no,
it's just what you came is just what you were born with.
Right.
You know,

1339
01:12:22.401 --> 01:12:23.790
it doesn't exist.
There's no such thing.

1340
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.690
<v 3>Men who are running with that w I'm sorry,
what's her name again?</v>

1341
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:31.820
[inaudible] those women who are running with her,
they just shit happens bro.

1342
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.730
You know,
if you're a heavyweight boxer and you grew up in the era of Mike Tyson,

1343
01:12:34.731 --> 01:12:38.870
yeah,
I'm sorry,
but this is just what you're stuck with.
This is what's going on.

1344
01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:41.870
And some people are just,
they just have advantages.

1345
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.200
They just have advantages physically,
mentally,
and there's outliers.
You found it.

1346
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:51.550
Sorry.
You got an outliner.
Might want to do something else.
Yeah.
APPS.

1347
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.470
I know.
What race is that Lee's going to run.
I don't run those races.
Yeah.

1348
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:57.110
Run a different,
not a different race.

1349
01:12:57.111 --> 01:13:01.250
That's always been money you feel about trans athletes,
you know?
Uh,
it's a good,

1350
01:13:01.251 --> 01:13:02.600
it's a good question.
I think it's,

1351
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.740
we're really going to go through like a cultural

1352
01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:09.760
<v 4>change on how we think about that.
You know,
it's,
it's morphing so quickly,</v>

1353
01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:12.310
you know what I mean?
Um,
uh,

1354
01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:17.200
I'm very much because I am of this opinion that there is no such thing as like

1355
01:13:17.201 --> 01:13:19.390
perfect fairness.
And when we make those distinctions,

1356
01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:24.040
we're always choosing who to allow and because I think we should choose to allow

1357
01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:28.960
like trans people to participate in society.
I'm for an inclusive approach where,

1358
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.420
you know,
we're able to like find a,

1359
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:35.890
find like a model that allows those folks to compete fairly in a way that

1360
01:13:35.891 --> 01:13:39.160
everybody's happy with.
I think that's the,
I think that's what we should do,

1361
01:13:39.161 --> 01:13:43.210
you know?
Um,
and that to me is like,
that's what makes me like sports more,

1362
01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.230
you know?
Um,
is those comparisons like,
um,
you know,

1363
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:50.560
another thing that pissed me off so much was like,
uh,
oh fuck.
What's his name?

1364
01:13:50.561 --> 01:13:54.040
The um,
the disabled runner who then killed his girlfriend.

1365
01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:57.280
<v 3>Oh yeah.
The,
the story,
a story,
the story is right.</v>

1366
01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.160
And people were saying about this guy that his,

1367
01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:03.340
that his a prosthetic gave him an advantage.
Now first of all,

1368
01:14:03.341 --> 01:14:06.160
there's no fucking way that's true because he doesn't have muscles,

1369
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.000
muscles converting food into does give you an advantage.
I mean to do things.

1370
01:14:10.001 --> 01:14:12.070
So I think mechanically does cause their

1371
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.230
<v 5>springs.
They essentially,</v>

1372
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:19.150
the way his leg works with those things is you play,
you've seen him,

1373
01:14:19.151 --> 01:14:23.600
right?
They don't even look remotely like feet.
Yeah.

1374
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:28.470
It's a crazy like,
but dude,
the,
he's hold on that,

1375
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.300
that's not an advantage because how mechanics work,
right?

1376
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.590
Is that a spring you put energy into it and you get a little bit less energy
out.

1377
01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:37.900
Right.
So cause that's the laws of thermodynamics,
right?

1378
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:39.010
You can get more out than you put in,

1379
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:43.120
except a muscle does give you more than you put in because a muscle converts

1380
01:14:43.121 --> 01:14:47.530
food into energy for a brief period.
Right.
And so he does,
he has sprint,

1381
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:49.390
he doesn't have springs.
Sorry.
He has springs.

1382
01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.850
He doesn't have a machine in his leg.

1383
01:14:51.851 --> 01:14:55.470
The way the rest of us do that creates force out of food.
Well,
you know,

1384
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.090
question is whether or not the lower half of his legs,

1385
01:14:58.091 --> 01:15:02.110
which is what he's missing,
could make up for the,
the advantage,

1386
01:15:02.111 --> 01:15:04.690
the mechanical advantage of the shape of those things,

1387
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.760
which applies all sorts of really unusual leverage when you're running.

1388
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:14.230
Totally.
You're not,
I mean I don't,
I don't know if it's,
I mean,

1389
01:15:14.231 --> 01:15:17.350
I don't know if you took him with full legs and took him with those things if

1390
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:18.490
they'd run the same amount of time.

1391
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:22.780
But the thing that we can run fast as fuck with those things you've seen those

1392
01:15:22.781 --> 01:15:24.910
guys,
well he could write,

1393
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.750
but where's all the other double amputees who are like,
you know,

1394
01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.670
calming of the Marine Track and field.

1395
01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.100
How many of them are trying to pair Olympics is huge.

1396
01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:35.080
There's like a ton of Paralympic athletes.
You know,

1397
01:15:35.081 --> 01:15:38.500
like I've been told that it has an mechanical advantage by someone who actually

1398
01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:41.470
should know what they're talking about.
But I want to,
I would like to look it up.

1399
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.820
Do those um,
legs,
horse's legs.
I hard.

1400
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:49.570
I remember reading stuff at the time from,
you know,
uh,
uh,
you know,
exercise,

1401
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.190
whatever,
uh,
athletic scientists forget what it's called.
Um,
who said that?

1402
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:55.160
Who said that?
It didn't,
right.
It didn't,

1403
01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:57.740
but so that's a debate that we could have.
Right?

1404
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:01.780
But the point that I was trying to make was looking at that Olympics.
God,

1405
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:05.170
that's a better event with that guy in it.
You know,
I'm so happy he was in it.

1406
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.010
Right?

1407
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:10.870
Like if it does give you an advantage when he comes in second place,

1408
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:13.150
you know?
Well,
so,

1409
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:16.780
so the point is when we make the rules of a game,
right?

1410
01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:19.120
And this is the point of our episode about Games,
which is about the Olympics.

1411
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:21.430
Actually,
when we make the rules of a game,
we are,

1412
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:24.160
there's no such thing as a perfectly fair competition that would be designed by

1413
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:26.400
God to be perfect and be perfectly fair.
Right?
Right.

1414
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.440
We're always making choices about what kind of competition we want to have and

1415
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:35.320
what,
who we want to allow into it and what sort of outcome we want to have.

1416
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.570
You know what I'm in,
right?
Just like in baseball,

1417
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.460
too many home runs move the mount up or down.

1418
01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.770
You know how they change the rules a little bit because they want more homeruns

1419
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.720
same thing with same thing with track and field.

1420
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.080
We changed the rules a little bit to allow this person and not allow this
person.

1421
01:16:47.081 --> 01:16:49.030
Right.
I think that when we're talking about people,

1422
01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:52.450
we should always try to include more people,
not less.
We should,
you know,

1423
01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:53.440
like if and if,
hey,

1424
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:55.990
if you're a double amputee and you can get your way into the Olympics and you

1425
01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:57.010
can make a plausible case,

1426
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:59.740
I think we should try to entertain that notion and we should try to find a way

1427
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:03.670
to get that guy in there.
Right.
As far as trans athletes go,
you know,

1428
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:04.420
we could have,

1429
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.300
we could sit here and talk for three hours about like all the different ways

1430
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:09.980
that hormones might affect your body.
It might not your body,
and I'm not

1431
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.900
<v 6>an expert on that and I don't want to claim to be right.</v>

1432
01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:17.260
But a sports with a trans athletes who are,

1433
01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:22.640
uh,
you know,
competing with the,
you know,
with their gender,
right?
That's,

1434
01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:25.640
uh,
that is a sporting world that I'm Morgan trusted in.
Right?

1435
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.710
And I think we should find a way to make that happen.

1436
01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:31.930
I know it can be really complicated,
complicated and messy,
right?
Um,
and,
uh,

1437
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.930
there's gonna be a lot debate about it and it's gonna make it's gonna be

1438
01:17:33.931 --> 01:17:36.770
uncomfortable,
you know,
and gonna be a lot of arguments.
But,
you know,

1439
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.350
I hope that that's the world that we've moved forward to.
That's my,

1440
01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.250
that's my point of view.

1441
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:45.470
<v 2>My point of view is that there's a reason,
there's a distinction.</v>

1442
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.030
There's a reason why we make the distinction to have male athletics versus

1443
01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:53.600
female athletics.
The reason is that males have a physiological,

1444
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:58.010
physiological advantage over women.
So in most sports,
most physical sports,

1445
01:17:58.011 --> 01:18:00.470
we do not have males compete with females.

1446
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.860
The question becomes when someone who was male transitions and becomes female,

1447
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:10.220
do those same physiological advantages apply?

1448
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.650
And what are the,
what is the evidence?
Well,

1449
01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:16.340
the evidence and competition seems to be that it shows that it does apply,

1450
01:18:16.341 --> 01:18:20.810
particularly in weightlifting,
rugby,
mountain biking power,

1451
01:18:20.811 --> 01:18:24.860
heavy sports that are,
that favor larger people,

1452
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.240
stronger bodies,

1453
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.410
males that transition to females have a significant advantage and they're

1454
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:31.610
breaking world records.

1455
01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.830
So if you're a woman and you're a natural woman and you don't take any extra

1456
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:38.000
hormones or male hormones,

1457
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:40.910
you're not taking steroids or any sort of performance enhancing drugs,

1458
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:44.390
you're doing your very best to compete and you're at the top of the heap.

1459
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.430
But then someone comes along that was a man for 30 years and decides that

1460
01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:53.210
they're going to be a woman and this has happened and literally transition a few

1461
01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:57.590
months ago and compete as a woman and destroys records and dominates you in that

1462
01:18:57.591 --> 01:18:59.300
sport.
That's bullshit.

1463
01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:03.470
And that's not competing on a level playing field.
That's a,

1464
01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.060
a person who is biologically a male and who was a male for 30 plus years of

1465
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:11.510
having testosterone run through their body and affect their tendon strength and

1466
01:19:11.511 --> 01:19:16.130
affect the shape of their bones and the mechanical advantages of the male hips

1467
01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:17.240
versus the female hips.

1468
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:22.220
And then they're competing with smaller people who have been a woman their whole

1469
01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:23.620
life.
It's not fair.
It's,

1470
01:19:23.621 --> 01:19:28.340
it's is as much cheating as taking steroids when the other person doesn't,

1471
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.430
or taking performance enhancing drugs when the other person doesn't.

1472
01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:34.760
Maybe even more so maybe in more so because you also have,

1473
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.700
there's a bunch of advantages in terms of reaction time that males enjoy.

1474
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:43.670
It's like it's some significant difference in reaction time between males and

1475
01:19:43.671 --> 01:19:48.170
even untrained males versus female professional athletes.
Well,

1476
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.340
<v 6>uh,
I disagree.
And,
and what do you disagree,
but I've already,
well,
the,</v>

1477
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:55.490
my main point being the one that I already made,
right?

1478
01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.080
That like I don't think that there is such a thing as a perfectly level playing

1479
01:20:00.081 --> 01:20:04.000
field.
I think we decide what kind of playing field we want to have.
Sure.
Make the

1480
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.130
<v 2>distinction where we don't allow men to compete in a women's divisions.</v>

1481
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.820
<v 3>And I think that that distinction may be breaking down a bit.
Right.</v>

1482
01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:13.840
And I think it may be time to break down that distinction a little.

1483
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:16.650
So you think that male should be able to compete in the women's division of

1484
01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:21.210
weightlifting?
Uh,
no,
I don't necessarily.
Um,
but Ken,
if they transition,

1485
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:26.280
<v 4>uh,
well first of all,
uh,
uh,
the,
the,</v>

1486
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.500
there's,
there's a lot of stuff to break down,
right?
And I'm not,

1487
01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:29.990
I'm not an expert on the subject,
right?

1488
01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:34.010
So it's just sort of my off the top of my head.
Um,
one thing is,
you know,

1489
01:20:34.011 --> 01:20:38.510
you're postulating a particular person who decided to transition,
uh,

1490
01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.960
at the age of 30.
Right?
And they were very big and strong before,
right?

1491
01:20:41.961 --> 01:20:45.740
And they decided to transition.
Now that is a type of person that exists,
right?

1492
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:50.930
Um,
I think over the next certainly 30 years,
we're going to see,
you know,

1493
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:52.480
uh,
now that,
uh,

1494
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.820
people are starting to understand that being trans is just a way that people are

1495
01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.730
right.
There are just people who are trans,
you know,

1496
01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.380
and this is something that we're going to accept and support,
right?

1497
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:05.390
You're seeing folks,
Tra transition much,
much earlier age,
you know,
um,

1498
01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.960
uh,
and,
and,
and so if someone is,
if someone is,
you know,

1499
01:21:08.961 --> 01:21:13.520
transitioning from the age of like,
you know,
seven years old,
right?
Um,
and,
uh,

1500
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:16.850
you know,
working with those hormones,
you know,
uh,
from that age,
right,

1501
01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.750
they're not going to have their body's situations can be very different than the

1502
01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:23.600
one that you,
that you postulated.
Right.
Uh,

1503
01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:26.750
I also know from my trans friends that the,
uh,

1504
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:30.110
the effects that the hormones have on your body are like really profound.

1505
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.280
You know,
like really,
really profound.
Like we're not like,
um,
uh,

1506
01:21:34.281 --> 01:21:38.930
to a surprising degree.
Right.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
you know,

1507
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:43.720
I have,
look,
if the question is how does,
you know,

1508
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:47.330
how does a person who starts taking hormones at a,
at a particular age,
right?

1509
01:21:47.331 --> 01:21:50.450
How does their body change and how's that affect visa vi athletic performance?

1510
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:52.610
I don't know.
We're in such new territory here,

1511
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:54.700
<v 3>right?
Well,
we certainly are,
and we particularly,</v>

1512
01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:58.690
we just scratched upon the idea of kids transitioning at a very early age.

1513
01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.110
I mean,

1514
01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:02.470
there's been more scientific evidence of points that if kids don't do that,

1515
01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:05.590
then when they wanted to be trans at an early age,
they just become gay men.

1516
01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:08.130
And that there's nothing wrong with that either.
Um,

1517
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:13.200
there's no reason to give kids hormones and there's no reason to decide before a

1518
01:22:13.331 --> 01:22:17.170
person's frontal lobe is completely full,
completely fully developed,

1519
01:22:17.171 --> 01:22:21.010
which doesn't even take place until the 25 kid.
People don't know who they are.

1520
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.680
A seven year old,
you,
you won't even,

1521
01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.920
people don't even give their seven year old phones.
You don't let them vote.

1522
01:22:26.921 --> 01:22:29.800
You're going to let them decide what sex they're going to be for the rest of

1523
01:22:29.801 --> 01:22:32.620
their life.
The research that I've seen,
and again,

1524
01:22:32.621 --> 01:22:34.200
I'm not an expert on this and yeah,

1525
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.020
<v 4>you know,
I'd love to,
this is a conversation.</v>

1526
01:22:37.021 --> 01:22:40.230
This is the thing I'd love to talk about on our show and I'd specifically love,

1527
01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:40.770
you know,

1528
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:45.240
this is before does the kind of topic where I really want to make sure that I

1529
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:49.240
know the research and that I'm also speaking to Trans folks,
you know,
um,
in,

1530
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.500
in this conversation.
But,
so to touch on just what I've,
you know,

1531
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.930
my own experience and what I've,
the research I've seen,

1532
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:59.400
the research I've seen is that trans kids from a young age,
uh,

1533
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:02.260
they are incredibly consistent in there,
you know,

1534
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:06.050
when they're expressing their gender identity,
um,
big jail was in

1535
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:10.780
<v 2>that and that my,
a lot of human beings,
yeah,
yeah.
But that,
that's,
that's fit.</v>

1536
01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:13.600
I'm just narrative by saying they're incredibly consistent.

1537
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:16.240
But like if you polled these people,
like what are you talking about?
Like if you,

1538
01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:20.580
<v 4>I mean that's,
I,
I look,
I,
I don't have the research in front of me that I saw,</v>

1539
01:23:20.581 --> 01:23:24.330
so I can't like go into the details on it.
But like,
yeah,
it was,
I mean,
it was,

1540
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:24.840
you know,

1541
01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.840
it was a research that was surveying and tracking like trans kids who declared

1542
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:33.210
their identity from a young age.
Did it change?
The answer was,
uh,
generally,
no,

1543
01:23:33.211 --> 01:23:37.560
it really didn't.
Um,
and,
uh,
you know,
I have a friend who has a,

1544
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:40.800
who has a trans kid,
um,
don't know the kids exact age,
but you know,

1545
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:44.730
in the age range that we're talking about and you know,
he's explained that like,

1546
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:49.650
well,
you know,
my child from a very young age consistently like said,
I am a girl,

1547
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:53.190
like,
and has never contradicted themselves,
never changed their mind.

1548
01:23:53.191 --> 01:23:56.490
And so the humane thing and the thing that he felt was going to do as a parent

1549
01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.930
was to like,
embrace that choice on his child's part.
Right.
Um,

1550
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:02.540
and yeah,
that's the,

1551
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:06.160
<v 2>the embrace that choice,
meaning hormonally,</v>

1552
01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.410
I shouldn't even phrase it as a choice,
like,
like embrace that identity.
Um,

1553
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.740
but it is a choice,
right?
I mean,

1554
01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:15.340
if I had chosen to add hormones to a child's body,
that's a choice.

1555
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:18.270
<v 4>Uh,
it's a than the choice on that.
It's,
it's the,</v>

1556
01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:21.970
it's a choice on a point on the part of the parent.
Um,
it's not a choice in the,

1557
01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.600
on the,
on the,
uh,
on the part of the child to like,

1558
01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.660
in the same way that being said with it being gay isn't a choice.
Yeah.

1559
01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.690
<v 2>That's who they are.
If they think that they're a girl,</v>

1560
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.530
why do you have to give them hormones to make them more of a girl?

1561
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.410
Uh,
because,
uh,
I'm sorry,
can you expand on the question?

1562
01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.910
Simple question.
If you say that the child thinks it's a girl,

1563
01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:49.630
so you're going to give the child hormones [inaudible] if the child thinks it's

1564
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:53.530
a girl,
let it be a girl.
Like you don't have,
why are you adding hormones?

1565
01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:58.060
If you're shooting hormones into a child and you're affecting the child's

1566
01:24:58.061 --> 01:25:00.880
development,
you're saying that's not a choice.
That's nonsense.
Of course.

1567
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:05.830
It's a choice.
You're choosing to chemically change this child's body.

1568
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.240
He choosing to inject things into this child's body on a regular basis that are

1569
01:25:10.241 --> 01:25:14.850
going to radically affect the physical development of their body.
Yeah.

1570
01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.630
And you're saying that this isn't a choice.

1571
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:18.250
What's definitely a choice to do that?

1572
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.980
<v 4>So,
so what Trans People Express,
um,
and again,
I'm not an expert.</v>

1573
01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:25.820
This is from me talking to my trans friends and,
and you know,
uh,

1574
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.980
seeing what other trans folks say is that the experience of being trans and not

1575
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.570
receiving hormones,
right?
And not having the body that you identify with,

1576
01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:41.640
the feeling of Dysphoria,
right,
is extremely like painful.

1577
01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:46.410
Um,
and is a condition unto itself,
right?
Um,
and,
uh,
the,
the,

1578
01:25:46.411 --> 01:25:50.010
the feeling of not belonging with the body that you have of that mismatch,
right?

1579
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:54.300
That seems to be in the broad variety of humanity,

1580
01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:58.300
the way that some people are born,
right?
Where their inner self,
right.

1581
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.810
The self that they are,
they're like,
I am a,
you know,

1582
01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:03.000
they're not thinking they are a woman.
They're like,
this is the,

1583
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.870
that I am doesn't match the body that they have.
Right.

1584
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.700
And that gives them extreme distress,
right?
And that leads to suicide.

1585
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:14.960
That leads to,
uh,
you know,
uh,
uh,
other damaging behaviors.
Right.

1586
01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:20.320
And the best treatment for that that we know exists is to,

1587
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.930
uh,
you know,
have,
do gender confirmation via hormones.

1588
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:28.490
Um,
and

1589
01:26:28.690 --> 01:26:30.820
<v 2>that doesn't effect the suicide rate.</v>

1590
01:26:30.821 --> 01:26:32.890
The suicide rate for Trans People's very high,

1591
01:26:32.891 --> 01:26:37.030
postop and preop really doesn't get affected by whether or not you treat them

1592
01:26:37.090 --> 01:26:41.260
well.
The operation,
uh,
you know,
one of the questions conception is why is that?

1593
01:26:41.261 --> 01:26:44.800
Is that because they're not accepted by society and we're not more loving?

1594
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:48.490
Could it be underlying issues that are causing them to feel this way in the

1595
01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:52.270
first place?
Like what is it we don't know.
And I felt,
I'm sure it varies widely.

1596
01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:54.240
It looks,
so I,
all I can do

1597
01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:59.200
<v 4>is,
uh,
defer to the experts that,
that I know about this.
Right.</v>

1598
01:26:59.201 --> 01:27:03.530
So,
um,
uh,
you know,
for instance,
there's an author named Bren Tana Hill,

1599
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.240
who's a,
uh,
former,
uh,
uh,

1600
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:08.800
former military helicopter pilot.

1601
01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:12.160
I just interviewed her for my new podcast that's coming out soon called

1602
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:15.340
factually.
I'm doing it on Earwolf and it's like a long form interview podcast.

1603
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:20.620
Um,
and so she's one of the people who's affected by,
uh,
the,
uh,
Trump,
uh,

1604
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.480
uh,
military ban on Trans Service people,
you know,

1605
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:27.220
so that's why we brought her home because she's trans.
Yeah.
Um,
and uh,

1606
01:27:27.221 --> 01:27:30.520
she wrote a fantastic book called everything you need to know about trans that

1607
01:27:30.521 --> 01:27:32.830
like she's a,
she is now a researcher,
right?

1608
01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:35.380
And she went into really deep detail about like,

1609
01:27:35.381 --> 01:27:39.070
here is all of the medical science here is all of here's all the science about

1610
01:27:39.071 --> 01:27:41.620
it.
And so at this point in the conversation,
I would say like,
hey man,

1611
01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:43.510
I just got a bone up on,
you know,

1612
01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:46.630
on that because I don't want to speak to suicide rates.
My

1613
01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.800
<v 2>concern is with children.</v>

1614
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:53.830
My concern is not with young adults deciding to take steps to confirm their

1615
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:56.420
gender identity,
who they feel they really are.

1616
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.510
I'm all for you doing whenever you want to do when you're an adult,

1617
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:03.050
when your mind is formed.
But people change their mind.
They change their opinion,

1618
01:28:03.051 --> 01:28:03.890
they changed their thoughts.

1619
01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.440
There's nothing wrong with just deciding to be a gay man.

1620
01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:10.040
There's nothing wrong with your body.
Uh,
you know,

1621
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:13.850
as you grow and mature and develop,
you growing out of these ideas,

1622
01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.340
some wheel in some world and the ones who won't,

1623
01:28:16.341 --> 01:28:18.920
they always have the option to do something later on in life.

1624
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.180
But if you do something to hormonally block a child valley very early on,

1625
01:28:23.181 --> 01:28:24.410
there's no turning back from that.

1626
01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:27.070
<v 4>Well let me say it,
let me say a few things of that.
First of all,</v>

1627
01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:31.210
it's not wrong to be concerned about children and there's a reason this is the

1628
01:28:31.211 --> 01:28:34.540
most intense part of this conversation and I think it's correct,
right?

1629
01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:37.930
Because we're all very concerned about children.
Right?
But I do want to say,

1630
01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:40.960
first of all,
I don't think it's correct that trans people,

1631
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:43.090
if they don't receive four months from an,
from a young age,

1632
01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.540
they simply become gay men.
Because I know it happens very often.

1633
01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:47.950
I know trans people,
if you

1634
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:48.511
<v 2>can find that,</v>

1635
01:28:48.511 --> 01:28:51.000
cause it was a big article that was written about that recently where they were

1636
01:28:51.001 --> 01:28:56.001
talking about whether or not gender confirmation surgery and hormone blockers on

1637
01:28:56.341 --> 01:28:59.310
young children is ethical because of this fact.

1638
01:28:59.670 --> 01:29:01.020
And this was what they were talking about,

1639
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:05.010
where people at one point in time wanted to be trans and they listed several

1640
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:08.310
famous examples and then as they became older,
just decided to be gang,

1641
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:11.850
including women who wanted to be men who just became gay women.
And I think,

1642
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:17.040
what's that girl's name that was in John Wick?
Ruby rose.
She was one of those,

1643
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:20.520
she was a trans when she was younger and now she's just a gay woman.

1644
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.180
<v 4>So look,
I,
I,
I know,
I know quite a few,
uh,
trans folks.</v>

1645
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:29.830
Right?
Um,
and I have to be honest,
none of the ones that I know,
we're,

1646
01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:33.100
I don't know any trans women personally who are gay men up until they

1647
01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:38.050
transitioned.
Right.
I know quite a few trans women who are straight men.
Right.

1648
01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:42.160
Um,
or who,
you know,
lived their lives as to present it as straight men.
Right.

1649
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:47.240
And then transitioned.
Right.
Um,
as an order come lesbians.
Uh,

1650
01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:50.260
yeah,
I mean that's,
that's one of the ways that people can be,

1651
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:52.540
I really recommend that.
Um,
oh,

1652
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:56.350
the other thing I was going to say is that I do know also among the Trans folks

1653
01:29:56.351 --> 01:29:58.450
that I know where the Trans people who speak about this,

1654
01:29:58.451 --> 01:30:03.100
that I've heard so many of them say,
I wish I had access.

1655
01:30:03.101 --> 01:30:07.360
I knew this about myself at a very young age and I wish to God that I had,

1656
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:11.650
that we had,
I had had the ability to receive these hormones at a young age.

1657
01:30:11.651 --> 01:30:14.500
My life would be so much better.
And I'm not gonna Argue with those folks.

1658
01:30:14.501 --> 01:30:15.270
You know,
I wouldn't know

1659
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.921
<v 2>these folks either.</v>

1660
01:30:15.921 --> 01:30:19.130
But you have to address the fact that there are people that have gone through

1661
01:30:19.131 --> 01:30:21.890
transition surgery and said,
I wish to God that I never did this.

1662
01:30:22.330 --> 01:30:23.360
There's a lot of those people too.

1663
01:30:23.361 --> 01:30:25.820
So if you're looking for anecdotal evidence and you want to be objective,

1664
01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:26.340
you kind of have,

1665
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.560
<v 4>I'm sure we can.
I'm sure we can find the anecdotes.
Um,</v>

1666
01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:32.820
I'm very curious and this is what I'd go consult my friend,
uh,

1667
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:35.380
or my recent interview,
such a brand hit Tana hills,
uh,

1668
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.630
work on this to see how many,
uh,
how many are in each group.
Right.
And uh,
which,

1669
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:41.640
which,
which sets of these folks are the outliers.

1670
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:44.190
I think the folks that you're talking about are probably the outliers,

1671
01:30:44.191 --> 01:30:47.190
but I can't confirm that.
All sir,

1672
01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.860
<v 2>juries have potential costs.
However,</v>

1673
01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:52.970
according to a Swedish study of 324 patients,
three 40,

1674
01:30:52.971 --> 01:30:57.110
1% of whom were born female surgery was associated with considerably higher risk

1675
01:30:57.111 --> 01:30:58.190
for mortality,

1676
01:30:58.191 --> 01:31:03.191
suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population.

1677
01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.290
So that's people who got the surgery.

1678
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:10.850
<v 4>I am curious,
wait,
3.4,
1% of them.</v>

1679
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.900
I mean the d the devil of this is in the details,
right?
Because how much is the,

1680
01:31:14.901 --> 01:31:18.380
is the higher risk,
what does it mean?
3.1% of those who were born female,

1681
01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.120
<v 2>well,
some of them were born female and the other ones were born male.</v>

1682
01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.400
The males that transition to females is what it's saying.

1683
01:31:23.401 --> 01:31:27.180
It's only saying a small percentage of them were born female that transitioned

1684
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:30.750
to male,
but the larger percentage was males who transitioned to female.

1685
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.770
And that the surgery that they received was associated with considerably higher

1686
01:31:34.771 --> 01:31:36.000
risks for mortality,

1687
01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:41.150
suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population that's

1688
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.690
not healing them.

1689
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:47.340
That's saying that having that surgeries associated with higher risk of

1690
01:31:47.341 --> 01:31:50.790
mortality,
suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity.

1691
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.800
<v 4>But it also says above following surgery,</v>

1692
01:31:52.801 --> 01:31:56.550
patients report lower gender dysphoria and improved sexual relationships right

1693
01:31:56.551 --> 01:31:58.980
before they killed themselves.
Everything's awesome.
Well,

1694
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.600
this isn't saying that people are killing themselves.
You know,

1695
01:32:01.601 --> 01:32:02.434
you're looking for,

1696
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.440
you're looking for something that confirms established opinion you and as are

1697
01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:10.640
you,
you know,
I mean we're,
we're,
we're looking at this and just look,

1698
01:32:10.641 --> 01:32:14.950
it should be,
we should be,
we should always be careful of drawing too much from,

1699
01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:19.540
you know,
a single study and like look at it widely.
Right.
Um,
but,
uh,

1700
01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:24.450
uh,
what was the point I was about to make?
Um,
it flipped my head.
Uh,
I,

1701
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.810
I'm sort of at the,
Oh,
here's what it was.
Um,
surgery.

1702
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:29.900
Another thing I know from,

1703
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:32.470
from speaking to the Trans folks is that surgery is overemphasized,
right?

1704
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:37.060
And then,
and that surgery for those folks is not the,

1705
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:37.571
you know,

1706
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:40.480
we as sort of straight CIS people tend to put too much emphasis on like,
oh,

1707
01:32:40.481 --> 01:32:41.890
did you get the surgery yet?
Or not?
You know,

1708
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:45.060
and really it's more about what are you living as and what is,
you know,

1709
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:49.090
what sort of set of hormones do you have?
Right.
Um,
but I,
I would really,
uh,

1710
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:53.350
one of the,
I've sort of reached the limit of like my facility with this topic.

1711
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:57.520
I really want to shout out,
um,
uh,
videos made by a friend of mine.

1712
01:32:57.650 --> 01:33:00.080
Her videos are called Contra points.
Her name's Natalie when,

1713
01:33:00.081 --> 01:33:04.210
and she does these increase.
She's a former,
a philosopher,
former philosophy phd,

1714
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.520
and she does these incredibly funny videos about,
is not just about transitions,

1715
01:33:09.521 --> 01:33:11.470
about all types of things.
Um,
uh,

1716
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.080
she had a really great one about comedy recently,
um,

1717
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.980
but she really breaks down like a lot of these,
uh,
a lot of misconceptions,
right.

1718
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:20.380
And has really changed every time I watch.
One of her videos.

1719
01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:23.560
I'm like learning new things and new ideas are like pop,
pop,
pop in my head,

1720
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:25.410
you know.
Um,
and I,

1721
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:28.870
I think you should check them out and you might enjoy talking to her on the,

1722
01:33:28.871 --> 01:33:32.020
on the show.
She's like a really fascinating person.
Contra points.

1723
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:35.140
It's an incredibly complex subject really.
It had a really is fuck

1724
01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.920
<v 2>angel on the podcast before who transitioned from female to male,</v>

1725
01:33:39.921 --> 01:33:43.880
which is also a different and interesting thing.
Um,
you know,

1726
01:33:43.881 --> 01:33:47.990
and he said that his whole life just felt like he was a boy and he didn't

1727
01:33:47.991 --> 01:33:50.810
understand why he didn't have a penis.
He didn't understand like the whole,

1728
01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:53.690
it didn't make sense.
And then once he transitioned to being a male,

1729
01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:57.680
then he felt complete.
I don't deny that.

1730
01:33:57.770 --> 01:34:02.770
My entire concern is that you're making decisions for children and that this is

1731
01:34:02.991 --> 01:34:05.300
a completely new thing with no historical precedent.

1732
01:34:05.301 --> 01:34:06.380
We've never done this before.

1733
01:34:06.381 --> 01:34:11.381
There's not like a history of hundreds of years of hormone blocker is being used

1734
01:34:11.481 --> 01:34:16.400
on young children and whether or not that is healthy and promotes a positive

1735
01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:19.940
life.
I feel like if a child thinks there are girl,

1736
01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.620
let them live as a girl,

1737
01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:26.180
but you don't have to hormonally engage with their body with chemicals.

1738
01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:30.200
It just seems crazy.
It seems ill advised.
It does.

1739
01:34:30.201 --> 01:34:35.201
It seems like this movement of acceptance and progressive thinking in in in many

1740
01:34:36.621 --> 01:34:39.380
ways is a fantastic thing.
It's a fantastic movement,

1741
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:44.590
but this seems to me to be a leap and that you're making this leap to confirm

1742
01:34:44.751 --> 01:34:47.360
your ideology and to confirm that you know,

1743
01:34:47.361 --> 01:34:50.750
you're 100% cool with trans people and you're 100% cool and you,

1744
01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:54.490
you're going to recognize this child is trans,
but you're doing something.
You're,

1745
01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.140
you're doing something to this child's body that you can't turn around.

1746
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:02.530
And if this child decides at whatever age we decide that you can make rational

1747
01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:06.800
decisions to transition as trans,
let them fully develop first.

1748
01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:09.920
Let them be a person,
let them make these decisions.

1749
01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:14.540
But if you want identify as a woman you and you want to keep your penis,

1750
01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:16.970
that should be fine too.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1751
01:35:16.971 --> 01:35:18.530
If you want to keep a functional penis,

1752
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.340
you want to identify as a woman and not even take hormones.
Who Cares?
Do that,

1753
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:23.120
do that.

1754
01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.120
But when you're stepping in to a developing baby that's only been alive for six

1755
01:35:28.491 --> 01:35:33.491
years and you're shooting chemicals into its body to change the way it develops,

1756
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:35.150
show me the research.

1757
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:40.540
Show me the decades of peer reviewed studies on one of the most important things

1758
01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:45.360
that we know of the development of a human being where you're going to home more

1759
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.790
hormonally,
interact with their body in some sort of a random doctor,

1760
01:35:49.791 --> 01:35:53.540
Frankenstein sort of way,
like how much but what evidence do we know?

1761
01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.930
What evidence do we have that this is a a powerful,

1762
01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.720
absolute like intelligent,

1763
01:35:59.721 --> 01:36:02.870
smart way to handle a child's life over the long term.

1764
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:06.980
Like when these kids grow to be 60 as opposed to kids who don't get the hormone

1765
01:36:06.981 --> 01:36:10.490
shots when they're six,
these people are 15% more happy.

1766
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:11.570
There's nothing like that,

1767
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.960
but yet people are jumping into it because it seems like the thing to do because

1768
01:36:14.961 --> 01:36:17.150
it seems like the tide of society is moving in that

1769
01:36:17.170 --> 01:36:21.550
<v 5>direction.
Well,
I,
I don't jump into it for that reason.</v>

1770
01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:22.450
Um,

1771
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:27.450
I do think that when we're talking about an issue that affects those people,

1772
01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:32.500
right?
The first thing we should do is listen to those people,
right?

1773
01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:35.830
So the children listen to the children and listen to the adults,
right.
Who said,

1774
01:36:35.831 --> 01:36:37.960
I used to be that child.
Okay.
But they are

1775
01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:41.450
<v 2>that child.
And you know,
to you said,
look,
everyone's different.</v>

1776
01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:44.750
So for them to say,
I was that child,
that's nonsense.

1777
01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.990
You were a similar child in a similar situation.

1778
01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.600
<v 5>We're not that China.
They're not literally,</v>

1779
01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.160
<v 2>but they don't know how that child is feeling.</v>

1780
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.860
They don't know how much that child is being influenced by its environment.

1781
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.890
They don't know how much their thoughts and their expressions are being

1782
01:36:57.891 --> 01:37:00.170
encouraged by their parents.
They don't know that child.

1783
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:04.280
<v 5>Sure.
So my point is,
when we're taught,</v>

1784
01:37:04.281 --> 01:37:05.900
when you and I are talking about this right now,

1785
01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:08.180
we're speaking pretty hypothetically,
right?
We're,

1786
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:10.430
we're talking about a child that is not in the room that we don't have.

1787
01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:12.050
We're talking about a fictional child.
Right.

1788
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:15.620
So what we really care about are the actual people.
Right.
Um,

1789
01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:20.510
and when we talk to the actual trans folks,
right.
And,

1790
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:25.400
uh,
talk to,
you know,
say,
Hey,
what do you think?
You know,
how do you feel?

1791
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.820
And,
uh,
you know,
include them in the conversation.

1792
01:37:28.821 --> 01:37:31.220
I think we have a different conversation about it.
You know,

1793
01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:34.130
we do have an conversation,
but we also have a different conversation.

1794
01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:37.580
We talked to people that have regret from transition surgery cause there's a lot

1795
01:37:37.581 --> 01:37:40.760
of those.
Sure.
But we're not,
we don't have either of those folks in the room.

1796
01:37:40.761 --> 01:37:44.090
Right.
You know,
we have to acknowledge that they're real as well.
Yeah.
I don't,
uh,

1797
01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:46.290
I'm not,
I'm not dismissing that those people are real.

1798
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:50.210
<v 2>Say if you talk to Trans folks,
you get this impression.</v>

1799
01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.570
That's not necessarily true.
Um,

1800
01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:55.860
a wide range of impressions.

1801
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.210
<v 4>I wasn't just,</v>

1802
01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:01.500
I wasn't talking about specifically the impression that I wasn't saying we

1803
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:06.480
should reason from anecdotal evidence.
Right.
I'm saying that,
um,
look,

1804
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:11.430
the last conversation I had with a person about this was a,

1805
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:12.240
uh,

1806
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.040
was a trans military veteran who is a researcher who wrote a book on,

1807
01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:19.230
uh,
on these issues,
right.

1808
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:24.260
Comprehensively looked at the research and told me that the research shows that

1809
01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:28.830
the evidence that you're asking for exists maybe not on a 30 year timeline,

1810
01:38:28.831 --> 01:38:31.140
but there have been studies of this in here's what we know about them,
right.

1811
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:34.110
About Children's.
Uh,
uh,
yeah.
I mean that's,

1812
01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.960
that is my understanding of the reason I have not looked at the research myself.

1813
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.240
And you know,
I have not done the topic on my shows,

1814
01:38:39.241 --> 01:38:42.540
the positive benefits of children transitioning.
I don't think that exists.
Well,

1815
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:47.490
we can't solve that in this conversation right here.
Um,
but,
uh,
so my point is,

1816
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.070
look,
I'm not going to go out on a limb and tell you more than I can.

1817
01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:53.010
I can say off the top of my head,
right,
because I'm not an expert on the subject.

1818
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:55.860
Uh,
this is something that,
you know,
if I,

1819
01:38:55.861 --> 01:38:58.050
if this were something we had done on our show and I had doubt dive into the

1820
01:38:58.051 --> 01:39:00.330
research more,
I could tell you more.
I know it exists,

1821
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.800
but I can tell you what I have been told exists by people who have made it their

1822
01:39:04.801 --> 01:39:09.000
business to know,
you know.
Um,
so,
uh,
so,
you know,

1823
01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:12.990
that would be my next step in the conversation.
Um,
uh,
but,
you know,

1824
01:39:12.991 --> 01:39:15.320
that's what I'm saying is,
uh,

1825
01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.360
those are including those folks in this conversation is a really critical part

1826
01:39:21.631 --> 01:39:25.050
of it for me.
Um,
so yeah.
Uh,

1827
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.640
what's a conversation in the world needs to have for sure.
Yeah.

1828
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.650
And I think it's one that we will have and you know,
again,

1829
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:36.150
just to bring it back to athletics,
right?
Um,
I think that the,

1830
01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:37.373
uh,

1831
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:42.590
undeniable existence of trans children to teenagers to adults,

1832
01:39:42.751 --> 01:39:46.470
right.
Who want to compete.
Right.
Um,
and who make a compelling case to that,

1833
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:48.960
that they should be able to compete,
right.
Um,

1834
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:50.940
is going to be selling that we're going to have to grapple with.
You know,

1835
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:55.310
I think there's going to be easy answers to it.
Um,
and yeah,
I mean,

1836
01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.153
I think the real,

1837
01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:01.350
the legitimate solution is a trans leak or a trans division to have a male

1838
01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:04.710
division of female division of Trans Division if you want to compete

1839
01:40:04.711 --> 01:40:08.850
athletically.
That's fair to me.
That makes sense.
Well,
I hope that there's,

1840
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.710
you know,
like say with the,

1841
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.160
you've got the pair Olympics and the Paralympics is really like,

1842
01:40:14.161 --> 01:40:15.900
it's divided you,
you know how they do it,

1843
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:19.080
where they do like all the different levels for you've got this much amputated

1844
01:40:19.081 --> 01:40:21.120
or you're this mobile and you can compete in this way,
you know?

1845
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.700
And so that's really great to make a way that,
you know,

1846
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:27.850
those folks can compete on a level as a playing fields.
We can be given the,

1847
01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.190
the manifold variations in human bodies.
Right.
But the fact that I,

1848
01:40:31.210 --> 01:40:33.510
Oscar Pistorius,
which by the way,
we should bring up the gun.

1849
01:40:33.511 --> 01:40:36.480
He killed his girlfriend,
which is a very weird part of the story.

1850
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.140
And he said he thought she was a robber bazaar.
Completely bizarre.

1851
01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:43.410
But the fact that he was able to compete in the Olympics,
right,

1852
01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:46.530
not just in the Paralympics.
I think it's such a wonderful thing,
you know,

1853
01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.090
and so I would hope that whatever organization we come up with,
you know,

1854
01:40:51.150 --> 01:40:53.830
allows for the,
uh,
uh,

1855
01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:58.570
allows for humans and all their variations to compete in the Maine League as

1856
01:40:58.571 --> 01:40:59.404
well.
Right.

1857
01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.700
<v 2>Because it's fair as possible.</v>

1858
01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.570
They come up with bionic legs like Steve Austin from the $6 million man.

1859
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:10.130
There's some people out there that will cut their fucking legs off to run
faster.

1860
01:41:10.131 --> 01:41:10.964
And that's real.

1861
01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:14.330
There are people that want to win so bad they would cut the bottom of their legs

1862
01:41:14.331 --> 01:41:17.990
off to get bionic prosthesis.
They wasn't really for sure.

1863
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:21.740
100% would,
would you?
No,
I wouldn't,
but I'm not crazy.

1864
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:24.560
Look this people that raise their hands just cause they,
they,
they're,

1865
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:25.460
they are a bit,

1866
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:28.300
do you know that people have that feeling that they're supposed to be disabled

1867
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:30.510
so they amputated their hands?
Yes.

1868
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.420
This people with all sorts of psychological disorders,

1869
01:41:32.421 --> 01:41:36.680
but the need to win is so insanely strong in some people.

1870
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.360
And if they found out that,
hey man,

1871
01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.520
well who gives a fuck about your feet and your calves,
man,

1872
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:42.530
they're going to look just like feet and calves,

1873
01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.810
except they allow you to run 45 miles an hour.

1874
01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.320
But don't think people would do it.
Isn't that a little similar to the idea

1875
01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.450
<v 4>where people say,
oh,
trans bathrooms,</v>

1876
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.570
it's just so men are just going to lie about us.

1877
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:53.170
They can go in the bathroom and peep at women.

1878
01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.600
And then when you actually expand that,
right,
and you're like,
hold on a second,

1879
01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:00.250
you're telling me a dude is going to tell the entire world I am.

1880
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:02.950
I am not an aunt.
I'm a woman.
They're gonna start dressing differently.

1881
01:42:02.951 --> 01:42:05.950
They're going to take hormones.
They're going to like live with the stigma,
right?

1882
01:42:06.130 --> 01:42:08.800
They're going to one of the most stigmatized type of people you can be in

1883
01:42:08.801 --> 01:42:11.650
America today was a trans person and they're going to live with that stigma.

1884
01:42:11.651 --> 01:42:12.620
They're gonna change our whole lives.

1885
01:42:12.621 --> 01:42:16.090
And they're going to do all of that just so they can peep at women in the

1886
01:42:16.091 --> 01:42:18.190
bathroom.
It doesn't make any sense.

1887
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:21.030
<v 2>Highly Unlikely.
And it doesn't make any sense,
but it also,</v>

1888
01:42:21.031 --> 01:42:23.820
that's not entirely what could happen.
The,

1889
01:42:23.850 --> 01:42:27.210
what also could happen is you could get some creep who dresses up like a woman

1890
01:42:27.211 --> 01:42:31.110
and goes to the mail to the women's bathroom.
You can get that.
I mean,

1891
01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:34.360
I'm all for Trans People.
Listen,
but you can't have it now.
I'm all for it.

1892
01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:38.340
But if you have a bathroom that allows trans people and you get some creep who

1893
01:42:38.341 --> 01:42:41.220
says,
I'm just going to pretend to be trans.
If you don't think that's real,

1894
01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:44.340
then you're crazy.
Of course people do that.
Of course there's,

1895
01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.060
and people if arrested,
no,
no,
there is,
there's people who have been arrested,

1896
01:42:48.090 --> 01:42:52.320
men who were sex offenders who dressed up as women and went into the women's

1897
01:42:52.321 --> 01:42:55.700
room and harassed women.
There's already been a wrists.
This is,
but it's not.

1898
01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.740
But at least when they happen to be trans,
but here's the thing,

1899
01:42:58.741 --> 01:43:02.280
they're not trans people and people that are taking advantage of a loophole and

1900
01:43:02.281 --> 01:43:03.860
their creeps and they,

1901
01:43:03.861 --> 01:43:06.720
they probably want it to go into the female bathroom anyway,

1902
01:43:06.721 --> 01:43:07.980
but they just couldn't do it before.

1903
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:11.400
And now that there's trans exclusive inclusive bathrooms,

1904
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:15.030
some creeps have been arrested doing that.
They're not trans people.

1905
01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:17.310
The real problem is the creeps.

1906
01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:19.860
The real problem is not the Trans people using the women's room.

1907
01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:21.460
They should of course be able to use the women's room,

1908
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.960
<v 4>but the creeps can go like you don't need a law firm like it.</v>

1909
01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:27.520
So if they're not trans people,
right,

1910
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:32.440
they are not supposed to be in the bathroom right there from the same way trans

1911
01:43:32.441 --> 01:43:33.970
people and this is what people were worried about,

1912
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.750
but they have arrested people doing that,

1913
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:39.330
but so they could also do that even if it was not a gender inclusive bathroom

1914
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.250
because there would be breaking the rules of the bathroom and exactly the same

1915
01:43:42.251 --> 01:43:43.084
way

1916
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:47.820
<v 2>making the bathroom man and address versus them being trans.</v>

1917
01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:52.400
See,
if you see a trans person,
oftentimes tramps.
People look very masculine.

1918
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:54.560
<v 4>There's no need.
If you're just going to pretend to be trans,</v>

1919
01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:57.620
there's no need to hide what you have to ask address.

1920
01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:02.740
All you have to ask ourselves is if the hypothetical or if the extremely,

1921
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:06.530
extremely rare situation that you're discussing right,

1922
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.630
is so horrifying to us and such a,
uh,

1923
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:16.690
such a big problem that it's worth disenfranchising millions of people from the

1924
01:44:17.271 --> 01:44:21.260
ability to simply go to the bathroom when they need to,
you know,
if,

1925
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:25.580
if that extreme edge case or hypothetical case,
right,

1926
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:30.600
are we really going to,
uh,
are we really going to,
you know,
uh,

1927
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:34.070
hurt all,
all of these actual people who actually exist and say,
hey,

1928
01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.490
I just need to Goddamn go to the bathroom,
you know,
um,
in a,

1929
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:42.410
in a place that is,
uh,
you know,
safe for me.
Right.
Um,

1930
01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:45.390
and I don't think,
I don't think it is,
you know,
like we,

1931
01:44:45.391 --> 01:44:50.180
we can talk about that one edge case all day long,
but the end of the day,

1932
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:53.180
it's been more than one case.
But I think,
here's the question,

1933
01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:56.630
what were,
what are there more of,

1934
01:44:56.870 --> 01:45:00.650
are there more trans people or they're more sexual predators?

1935
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.730
100% more trans people than sexual predators who are specifically going to put

1936
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.380
on a dress.

1937
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:11.100
And in order to go into a bathroom specifically.
Yeah,

1938
01:45:11.101 --> 01:45:14.660
100%.
There's more trans people like by a factor of a million.

1939
01:45:15.010 --> 01:45:19.550
Well I don't know how many people are trans.
Uh,
what's the numbers on that?

1940
01:45:19.610 --> 01:45:22.820
You know,
I don't know.
But I would,
I would consult my,
a consultant,

1941
01:45:22.821 --> 01:45:25.530
my friend Brian's book to find out,
because I'm sure it's in,
I guess she,

1942
01:45:25.630 --> 01:45:29.030
she wrote a book that breaks down all of these statistics called everything you

1943
01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:31.460
need to know about trading mine field of a subject.
You know,

1944
01:45:31.461 --> 01:45:34.840
as soon as you start bringing this shit up,
people go crazy cause it's,
uh,

1945
01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:38.690
it's complicated and people,
they dig their heels in the ground,
in both sides,

1946
01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:42.410
you know,
and,
you know,
I,
I tried to have,

1947
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:44.300
I'm happy we're able to have a conversation about it.

1948
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.990
I try to have a conversation that's based on,
you know,
what,

1949
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:52.470
I try not to say more than I than I think I can say,
uh,
with,
you know,

1950
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:55.820
with surety.
Um,
and,
uh,
you know,

1951
01:45:55.821 --> 01:45:58.430
but my basic principle is,
man,

1952
01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:02.150
I just want to defer to the humanity of the people that I'm talking about.

1953
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:04.580
You know what I mean?
And rather than say,
oh,
well here's my idea,

1954
01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:08.420
here's my concern.
What about though?
What if,
uh,
you know,
what,
what if a,

1955
01:46:08.421 --> 01:46:10.630
a space alien were to come down to x,
Y,
z?
You know what I mean?

1956
01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.010
Rather than trying to come up with thought experiments about it,
you know,

1957
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:16.970
it was like,
hey,
there's some people in America,
they're making a polite request.

1958
01:46:16.971 --> 01:46:20.780
Can we use the bathroom?
Please go ahead.
You know,
that's,
that's my,

1959
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:22.800
that's what I default to write.
Or just killed it forever.

1960
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.060
And if they kill the performance and you don't have any issues,

1961
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.630
I think there's a way with sports again,
right?
I genuinely think,
hey my,

1962
01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.390
my default is I understand his problem.

1963
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:35.450
I understand you're going to have female athletes who,
who are,
who say,
Hey,

1964
01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:36.860
wait a second,
is this fair?
Right.

1965
01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.610
I think we can go forward with good faith and find a way.

1966
01:46:40.611 --> 01:46:42.860
Let's find a model that works for everybody.
You know,

1967
01:46:42.861 --> 01:46:46.670
I think we can do it in a way that respects the humanity of the trans athletes

1968
01:46:46.671 --> 01:46:50.300
and assists athletes.
I think that we can do that.
Um,
and that's the,

1969
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:51.550
that will always be mine.

1970
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:54.200
<v 2>It's easy to say as an outsider,
if you're a female athletes,</v>

1971
01:46:54.201 --> 01:46:57.690
it's been forced to compete with trans women who used to be men for most of

1972
01:46:57.691 --> 01:46:58.111
their lives.

1973
01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:01.200
I think you'd have a different opinion because I think they have a distinct

1974
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:04.190
physiological advantage that's been expressed many times.
I mean,
it's,

1975
01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:08.340
there's just a lot of records have been broken by Trans women who are now

1976
01:47:08.341 --> 01:47:11.940
weightlifters and there's that one who's the fucking dirt biker,

1977
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:16.950
who's was a professional dirt bike professional rider before as a man and then

1978
01:47:17.971 --> 01:47:21.690
transitioned over to a woman.
It's just dominating these things.
It's just,

1979
01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:25.590
I don't necessarily think it's fair.
I think just like,

1980
01:47:25.591 --> 01:47:27.660
it's not fair for a man to compete as a woman.

1981
01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:31.530
I don't think that all those disadvantages or those advantages rather go away

1982
01:47:31.710 --> 01:47:34.710
when you transition,
especially in a short time period.

1983
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.880
I just don't think they do.

1984
01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.770
And I don't think there's any evidence that shows they do,

1985
01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:41.520
there's a diminishing amount,
but how much so,
and in fact,

1986
01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:45.420
there's a doctor,
a board certified endocrinologist,

1987
01:47:45.450 --> 01:47:47.550
Dr Ramona Crut sick I think is her name.

1988
01:47:47.551 --> 01:47:51.900
We did a whole article on this about fighters,
about male fighters,
uh,

1989
01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:56.220
transitioning to becoming female and competing as female,
which has happened.

1990
01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:00.510
And they're saying that not only does the estrogen therapy,
uh,

1991
01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:02.940
it actually preserves bone density.

1992
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:07.500
It doesn't just turn them into a woman or turn them into female or so their

1993
01:48:07.501 --> 01:48:09.210
hormonal profiles similar to females,

1994
01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.580
but also preserves their masculine bone density.

1995
01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:14.820
Because one of the reasons why women lose bone density as they get older is a

1996
01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:16.790
lack of estrogen.
That's part of the reason why I asked her.

1997
01:48:16.791 --> 01:48:20.570
A process kicks in that that stops it in its tracks when you're,

1998
01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:24.330
you're injecting,
um,
female hormones into a male's frame.

1999
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:26.700
So they maintain this male bone density.

2000
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:31.490
Now there's also arguments that African American female bone density is on,

2001
01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:36.420
in many cases,
similar to a white European male bone density.

2002
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:38.180
So that's the,
um,

2003
01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:41.700
the argument about the outliers and about whether or not it's a level playing

2004
01:48:41.701 --> 01:48:42.720
field because it most certainly is.

2005
01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:47.450
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,
so that,
that's where I get back to the idea that,
look,</v>

2006
01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.720
could someone show that a athlete who a trans athlete who wants to compete is

2007
01:48:54.081 --> 01:48:58.580
going to have a physiological advantage because of their history of transition.

2008
01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:03.200
Right?
Could that be the case?
Sometimes.
Probably so.
You know,
I'm not gonna,

2009
01:49:03.201 --> 01:49:05.600
I'm not gonna argue that.
Well,
let's,
how about this,

2010
01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:08.270
because I actually don't want to know one way or the other because I have not

2011
01:49:08.271 --> 01:49:11.530
looked at any research on this,
so I don't wanna make any claim.
Um,
so let's just,

2012
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:15.140
let's just grant that for the sake of this thought experiment.
Right.
Okay.
Um,

2013
01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.120
so that being said,

2014
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:21.530
let's compare that against every single other advantage that every other

2015
01:49:21.531 --> 01:49:25.310
competitor could have.
Socioeconomic advantage,
right.
Country of origin.
Um,

2016
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:28.670
you know,
whether or not they live in Denver,
if they live below sea level,

2017
01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:32.000
you know,
like all those different things.
Right.
Um,

2018
01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:37.190
do is it humane to draw a line around that one unearned advantage,
right?

2019
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:42.350
Uh,
against all those other honor and advantages,
you know,
at what point does our,

2020
01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.010
uh,

2021
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:47.090
fantasy of having a level of having a true level playing field end up hurting,

2022
01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.360
you know,
end up,
end up excluding people.

2023
01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.940
And that's the conversation that I think we could have.
You know,
I,

2024
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:57.820
I heard a really great,
I,
this is just the beginning of a thought,
right?
Um,

2025
01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:01.750
but,
um,
it came up,
so just somewhere I was talking to,
um,

2026
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:06.260
uh,
uh,
uh,
some people about this,
uh,

2027
01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:09.730
and in sports,
one of the things,

2028
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.740
our assumption that men have an advantage over women,
right?
In sports,
in sports.

2029
01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:17.080
Yeah.
Our assumption.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
let me,

2030
01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:19.840
let me expand on our assumption that men have an advantage over women in sports,

2031
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.040
um,

2032
01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:25.840
is partially based on the fact that so many of the sports were designed for male

2033
01:50:25.841 --> 01:50:30.670
bodies,
right?
They're optimized for male bodies,
right?
Basketball for example.

2034
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:35.530
Right.
Um,
uh,
you know,
was an optimized for mailbox.
It's like the,

2035
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:40.420
uh,
the,
uh,
the height of the basket.
You know,
the,

2036
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:43.990
um,
uh,
the way that the ball moves around,
you know,
like,

2037
01:50:43.991 --> 01:50:46.790
like if we were at ball moves,
if we're going to say that,

2038
01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:51.640
if we're going to say that men and women have physiological differences,
right?

2039
01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:55.210
And then we're creating sports and the sports are sort of tuned to the

2040
01:50:55.211 --> 01:50:56.440
physiological differences.

2041
01:50:56.690 --> 01:51:01.100
<v 2>We're splitting hairs here.
We're talking about power,
speed,
athleticism,</v>

2042
01:51:01.130 --> 01:51:02.750
all those.
There's an advantage of that

2043
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:06.700
<v 4>when you look at say gymnastics,
right?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

2044
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:11.630
I would say that like women for the events that are in a women's gymnastic

2045
01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:15.620
competition,
right?
Having an advantage over men,
right?
Women don't,

2046
01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:20.300
women don't compete on the ring hold thing.
You know what I'm in.
Right?
Uh,

2047
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:24.710
men don't compete at,
at some of that crazy,
uh,
you know,
bar shit.

2048
01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:29.600
You know what I mean?
Like it larger there,
it's its height,
its flexibility.

2049
01:51:29.601 --> 01:51:31.010
It's like there's a lot going on,
right?

2050
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:34.400
So that's a rare case where Ge women's gymnastics,

2051
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:38.270
we've actually created events in that and like competitions that like only women

2052
01:51:38.271 --> 01:51:40.190
can do.
Right.
Um,

2053
01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:43.760
and so we sort of optimize that sport more for a female body.
Right.

2054
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:47.600
What if we did that with a lot more sports.
Right.
Um,
and how about this?

2055
01:51:47.630 --> 01:51:51.790
What if we were able to develop,
cause again the rules of the game,
right,

2056
01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:54.920
are not absolute.
The rules of the game are things that humans create.
Right.

2057
01:51:55.250 --> 01:52:00.230
And so why do we like maybe part of our assumption that men are better at sports

2058
01:52:00.231 --> 01:52:03.110
than women or men have an advantage of sports and women are that we have

2059
01:52:03.111 --> 01:52:03.651
constructed,

2060
01:52:03.651 --> 01:52:07.430
most of the Games that we've constructed are actually sort of biased towards a

2061
01:52:07.431 --> 01:52:08.570
male type of body.

2062
01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:10.470
<v 2>That sounds ridiculous.
First of all.</v>

2063
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And reason why gymnastics is like why women are good at gymnastics,

2064
01:52:16.921 --> 01:52:19.320
first of all,
their,
their flexibility,
their lightness,
all those things.

2065
01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:24.120
Also they're not competing against men in a one on one type of situation.

2066
01:52:24.121 --> 01:52:26.940
Like one's trying to defend the other one's trying to attack like a game of

2067
01:52:26.941 --> 01:52:31.941
basketball or a game of football or any other sort of team sport with any male

2068
01:52:32.251 --> 01:52:34.940
gymnast and trying to have them compete against the jets.

2069
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:37.080
That's not going to be a little those things.

2070
01:52:37.081 --> 01:52:38.910
It's a physical event as opposed to a sport.

2071
01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.420
So a physical event is you have to do this thing.
It's very athletic.

2072
01:52:42.421 --> 01:52:45.030
It's an athletic endeavor.
Sure do it as a balance.
You land.

2073
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.060
No one's trying to stop you from doing it again.

2074
01:52:47.061 --> 01:52:50.420
When you're shooting basketballs,
you're not just shooting basketballs.

2075
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:54.650
You're trying to shoot a basketball,
what people were trying to defend.

2076
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.360
You're trying to Juke left and then go right.
You're trying to be sneaky.

2077
01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:03.170
You're trying to shoot from the outside.
There's all this shit going on in.

2078
01:53:03.171 --> 01:53:07.220
A lot of,
it involves your ability to move fast,
to close distance,

2079
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:09.170
to have the physical strength,
the leap up in the air,

2080
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:13.730
and there's a huge physical advantage that men enjoy and this is not because the

2081
01:53:13.731 --> 01:53:17.960
sports designed this way.
It's because the support is very simple.

2082
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:20.870
There's a basket on one side of basket on the other side.

2083
01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:24.020
You got to get it in here.
They got to get it in there.
Ready,
go.

2084
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:27.890
If you're faster and your stronger,
you'll be able to accomplish that better.

2085
01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:29.750
Males are faster and stronger.

2086
01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:32.330
There's a reason why there's a male and a female division.

2087
01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:37.160
It's not that these sports were designed for males is that men are physically

2088
01:53:37.161 --> 01:53:41.330
bigger and stronger and faster than this.
These are physiological advantages.

2089
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.661
Yeah.

2090
01:53:41.661 --> 01:53:45.850
You can have a thing like a gymnastics balance beam event where women are going

2091
01:53:45.851 --> 01:53:49.130
to shine because they're lighter and more flexible and they can do things with

2092
01:53:49.131 --> 01:53:52.250
their body that men can't because of the shape of them.
All the mass,

2093
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:56.450
all the different things.
But that's rare.
That's the outlier.
I,
yeah,
I don't,

2094
01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:59.480
I don't think we actually disagree that much.
Um,
the reason it's rare

2095
01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:04.450
<v 4>is because historically we've created most of our sports around things that men</v>

2096
01:54:04.451 --> 01:54:06.340
have the advantage,
and you're,
you're not wrong.

2097
01:54:06.850 --> 01:54:08.050
<v 2>Boards are,</v>

2098
01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:13.360
most sports involves speed and power,
most ports,

2099
01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.660
but why men have an advantage in speed and power.
I know,

2100
01:54:16.661 --> 01:54:18.220
but we created those sports,
right?

2101
01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.310
Like what would we possibly be able to create where women would have an

2102
01:54:21.311 --> 01:54:26.311
advantage that is an athletic event where a man speed and power does not give

2103
01:54:26.921 --> 01:54:28.010
him an advantage.
I'm in La,

2104
01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:33.060
<v 4>look,
man,
this,
this is not,
again,
like I said,
this is the beginning of a thought,</v>

2105
01:54:33.061 --> 01:54:33.741
right?
I'm trying to,

2106
01:54:33.741 --> 01:54:35.980
I'm trying to use this as a thought experiment as sort of like a,

2107
01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:40.560
a possibility opening device.
Right?
Right.
But so you,
you postulate,
hey,

2108
01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:41.530
now you,

2109
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.400
you make a fair point that there's a difference between individual athletic

2110
01:54:44.401 --> 01:54:48.110
events like gymnastics and competitive one-on-one or events like,
you know,

2111
01:54:48.150 --> 01:54:52.680
grappling or,
or basketball or something like that.
Right?
And so,
um,
and again,

2112
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:56.250
I'm thinking this through myself as I'm talking about it,
right?
But,
um,

2113
01:54:57.390 --> 01:55:01.380
like I don't think it's impossible that you could come up with a one on one

2114
01:55:01.381 --> 01:55:04.350
competition that,
uh,
privileges that that is,

2115
01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:09.210
that is designed around the same athletic qualities that make a women make a

2116
01:55:09.211 --> 01:55:12.750
woman,
uh,
give her an advantage in a certain gymnastics event.

2117
01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:15.630
I don't think there's any reason you couldn't do the same thing for a find a one

2118
01:55:15.631 --> 01:55:20.280
on one competition that did the same thing.
Right?
Um,
there's also,
uh,

2119
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:24.530
what could it be a,
I mean,
well,
here's an example.
Uh,
for instance,
uh,

2120
01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:29.490
I believe,
I'm not sure,
I'm not 100% sure,
but I believe in like shooting events,

2121
01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:34.260
right?
Uh,
for example,
that women and men are on a level playing field.
Correct.
Or,

2122
01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:38.170
or that,
uh,
like,
you know,
sort of air rifle sort of thing.
Um,

2123
01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:41.220
that like there are events,
right?
Uh,
there,

2124
01:55:41.221 --> 01:55:44.260
there do exist athletic where,
uh,

2125
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.830
<v 5>you can have men and women in direct competition with each other,
right.</v>

2126
01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:47.760
Where that,

2127
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.760
where that event is not designed around a particular facet of a,

2128
01:55:53.070 --> 01:55:57.090
you know,
male or female body.
Right.
Um,
so,
uh,

2129
01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.330
my point is,
look,
men,
have we you,

2130
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:04.230
do you agree that men have run the country in the world for like most of

2131
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:07.380
civilization?
Like most every country.
Okay,
great.

2132
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:11.820
So men have been the ones setting up the sports.
So the fact that as you say,

2133
01:56:11.821 --> 01:56:15.840
it's rare that we have sports that are sort of more designed around a female,

2134
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:19.260
you know,
the differences between women as opposed to men.
Right.

2135
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.470
I think that might be because men had been setting up all the sports.
Right.

2136
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:26.730
And so my,
so my point is sports that women gravitate towards.

2137
01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:30.750
How do you mean there's sports that women gravitate towards that they really

2138
01:56:30.751 --> 01:56:33.810
enjoy this,
like women's volleyball.
She a witch,
right?
Oh No,

2139
01:56:34.050 --> 01:56:39.050
there's many women have traditionally gravitated towards gymnastics as you said

2140
01:56:39.211 --> 01:56:40.470
earlier,
is the example.

2141
01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:44.670
But those are way more women involved in gymnastics and men.
Oh,
absolutely.
Um,

2142
01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:47.520
but there,
those are the sports that get the less attention.

2143
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:49.890
Right now we have less huge amounts.
It sure does.

2144
01:56:49.891 --> 01:56:52.680
It's one of the rare examples of like ones where,
you know,

2145
01:56:52.681 --> 01:56:55.620
that is a real female forward,
you know,
female first sport,
right?

2146
01:56:55.621 --> 01:56:58.320
No one bothers me the most is the volleyball.
Why's that?

2147
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:59.790
Because the girls have to dress like hoes,

2148
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:02.580
like even in the Olympics that were thongs.

2149
01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:07.830
I fucking basketball players and address like that.
Yeah,
that's fucked up man.

2150
01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:11.550
They can choose what they're wearing.
I think.
What's her name?

2151
01:57:11.551 --> 01:57:15.290
The Muslim Egyptian team.
They dress in national guard.

2152
01:57:15.291 --> 01:57:18.450
What's the name of the volleyball player who has a,
has the black tape on?
Um,

2153
01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.640
very famous.
You know,
the,
the,
the two,
the two women,

2154
01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:23.160
the two women from the u s they're very famous volleyball players.

2155
01:57:23.161 --> 01:57:24.030
Whose names I can't remember.

2156
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:25.890
They probably aren't complaining about what they're wearing.

2157
01:57:25.891 --> 01:57:28.320
They're probably choosing what they're wearing.
I don't know.
Um,

2158
01:57:28.321 --> 01:57:30.990
I don't think anyone is forced them to wear that stuff,
but I mean,

2159
01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:33.330
when I tune into a Olympic volleyball,

2160
01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.700
my Tim like these girls in their underwear pretending they're at the beach,

2161
01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:37.350
they're not even at the beach.
It's a choice.

2162
01:57:37.351 --> 01:57:41.160
Apparently they want it to where they want to wear it.
Good move.

2163
01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:44.910
But is that a choice for the men?
Basketball players?
Can they wear thongs?

2164
01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:48.970
They can wear short shorts.
If they decided where they,
they could wear it like a,

2165
01:57:48.971 --> 01:57:53.010
a cut off with a midriff showing and a and a little booty shorts.

2166
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:53.851
They might be allowed to,

2167
01:57:53.851 --> 01:57:57.150
if they wanted to speak it back to CBS in their masculinity,

2168
01:57:57.151 --> 01:57:58.930
they might get shit in the locker room,
you know what I mean?

2169
01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:00.650
But maybe they make a point.

2170
01:58:00.651 --> 01:58:03.960
I like the short shorts that they used to wear a couple of decades ago,
so,
okay,

2171
01:58:03.961 --> 01:58:05.700
look,
yeah,
Larry Bird style.
You know,

2172
01:58:05.701 --> 01:58:09.840
one of the things I love about baseball and I started watching baseball is a,

2173
01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:12.330
you get to choose your own baseball pants.
He ever noticed that,

2174
01:58:12.331 --> 01:58:14.130
like they get to choose.
When you look at them.

2175
01:58:14.131 --> 01:58:17.670
Some of them were really tight baseball pants and then someone wear really baggy

2176
01:58:17.671 --> 01:58:20.070
baseball pants and I just love imagining,
I like clothes.

2177
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.950
I imagine them going to like the baseball Taylor and being like,

2178
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:27.720
dude I want to like sag my pants.
I want to,
you know,
show a little swag.

2179
01:58:27.721 --> 01:58:29.430
But you don't want to impede your performance.

2180
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:34.170
So I think the tight would be better as you're running swimmers shape their

2181
01:58:34.171 --> 01:58:35.790
bodies to be more aerodynamic.

2182
01:58:35.791 --> 01:58:38.700
I mean how much really if you're just running to first base,

2183
01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:42.310
how much does like baggy pants?
The wind,
the baggy pants.

2184
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2185
01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:45.610
<v 6>That is a real will you look at like Manny Ramirez had like the baggy his pants.</v>

2186
01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:49.240
I remember and like you had to imagine that guy was like a little bit suboptimal

2187
01:58:49.241 --> 01:58:51.840
with his baseball pants.
You know,
maybe cause he was at like

2188
01:58:52.130 --> 01:58:53.090
<v 2>and stuff.
Yeah.</v>

2189
01:58:53.210 --> 01:58:56.300
Maybe had big ass thighs and the only feel good with the baggy pants.

2190
01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.940
<v 6>Let me just put a bow on on what I was trying to get earlier.
Right.</v>

2191
01:58:58.941 --> 01:59:02.090
Cause I know I was,
I was sort of like getting to a pretty spacey place.
Um,

2192
01:59:02.150 --> 01:59:06.920
my point is just what our show is about so much is about showing how the things

2193
01:59:06.921 --> 01:59:08.420
that we take for granted in our world,

2194
01:59:08.421 --> 01:59:11.810
like the way the world is so much of the time is just something that we built.

2195
01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:13.520
Right,
right.
And we can question it.

2196
01:59:13.730 --> 01:59:17.900
And so when we say men are men have evangelists in women over sports,
I'm like,

2197
01:59:17.901 --> 01:59:18.561
well,
hold on a second.

2198
01:59:18.561 --> 01:59:22.370
Let's look at how we set the sports up and is it possible that we could set up,

2199
01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.080
set it up in a different way,
right.

2200
01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:26.690
That would allow more people to compete in sports.
Right?

2201
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:27.860
It might not be the same sports.

2202
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:31.790
I'm not going to say that women should play in the NFL against men.
Right.

2203
01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:33.620
I don't think it would be safe.
I don't think anyone should play in the NFL.

2204
01:59:33.621 --> 01:59:38.240
Frankly.
I think it's way too dangerous.
Uh,
it's very bad for people.
But um,
uh,

2205
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:41.210
is it like,
is our assumption just based on,
Hey,

2206
01:59:41.211 --> 01:59:42.710
these are the sports that we invented.

2207
01:59:42.711 --> 01:59:45.080
We happened to invent sports that were men have the advantage.

2208
01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:49.220
Can we imagine a world where 90% of sports are ones where women have an

2209
01:59:49.221 --> 01:59:52.490
advantage of would we be having a different conversation?
And if that's the case,

2210
01:59:52.730 --> 01:59:55.190
could we come up with some sports that like everybody,

2211
01:59:55.650 --> 01:59:57.960
you know that where there's no,
uh,
does it

2212
01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:01.630
<v 2>nonphysical sports?
I think.
Um,
but I think yeah,</v>

2213
02:00:01.631 --> 02:00:05.770
you could come out with competitions were women and female,

2214
02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:09.280
traditional female characteristics would have an advantage for sure.
You could,

2215
02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:11.620
I mean,
it could definitely be done,
you know,

2216
02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:15.610
it's just the ones that exist now when that involve running and lifting things

2217
02:00:15.611 --> 02:00:20.420
and moving fast physical lot physiologically males have an advantage.
Yeah.

2218
02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.270
That's why we have these distinctions and went to,

2219
02:00:22.271 --> 02:00:25.510
while we have men's divisions and women's divisions over hundreds and hundreds

2220
02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:28.570
of years ago.
You know what,
that's just not fair.
It's not fair,
you know?

2221
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:34.000
But you know,
I mean,
it,
is,
it the like that's the,

2222
02:00:34.001 --> 02:00:36.040
that's the notion of fairness we have now.
And you know,

2223
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:39.250
I think the interesting thing about the question trans athletes is it's going to

2224
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:41.320
challenge that notion.
It's going to lead to conversations like this one.

2225
02:00:41.321 --> 02:00:43.750
You know,
I think that's really cool and that's what I think we're sort of,

2226
02:00:43.751 --> 02:00:47.620
we should be down to have as a society,
right?
You're talking about things,

2227
02:00:47.621 --> 02:00:50.170
especially when there's a disagreement is the only way to solve them.

2228
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:51.581
But you know,

2229
02:00:51.581 --> 02:00:56.110
I think these conversations oftentimes become these shouting matches and I,

2230
02:00:56.111 --> 02:00:56.531
you know,

2231
02:00:56.531 --> 02:00:59.380
everybody digs their heels in and as you were talking about before about how

2232
02:00:59.381 --> 02:01:04.381
people's identities get really locked into ideas that they've held strong to,

2233
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.860
whether it's,
um,

2234
02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:10.540
I did an identities about religion or identities about politics,
right?

2235
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.780
I mean,
that's why when you were talking about Alphas and Betas,
people like,

2236
02:01:13.781 --> 02:01:16.570
why is this show getting political?
This is how Dorky people get.

2237
02:01:17.190 --> 02:01:20.740
There's nothing political about that.
But you think it's political because it,

2238
02:01:20.741 --> 02:01:23.560
it represents these rigid ideology.

2239
02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:25.650
<v 6>Exactly.
It did,
it,
it was,</v>

2240
02:01:25.651 --> 02:01:28.650
we stumbled across something that was like a really deep,

2241
02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.650
this men's rights activist types.
And then they connect that to their,

2242
02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:35.220
to their national politics and their sex,
gender,
politics and everything.
And,

2243
02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.860
and it was just like,
just the idea of questioning that really them off.
Right.

2244
02:01:39.861 --> 02:01:43.940
But what I'm about is questioning all these things,
you know,

2245
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:44.990
this conversation that we had,

2246
02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:47.450
this disagreement to the extent that we were disagreeing,
um,

2247
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:49.670
I think is a really good one to have.
You know,

2248
02:01:49.671 --> 02:01:54.671
and I'm always testing what I think I know and trying to sort of undermine it

2249
02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:57.560
and say like,
do I know this for sure.
I mean,
dude,
on our show,

2250
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:59.780
we have done more than one segment.

2251
02:01:59.781 --> 02:02:02.690
We have another one coming out later this year where we like go back and we

2252
02:02:02.691 --> 02:02:03.710
correct our own mistakes.

2253
02:02:03.711 --> 02:02:07.190
We correct the things that we've done wrong on our show.
What was a big one?
Um,

2254
02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:09.350
let's see.
A really big one,
uh,

2255
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:14.210
that we have a coming out.
Um,
I'll give you a preview.

2256
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:19.220
Um,
we did one about,
uh,
uh,
there was,
uh,

2257
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:23.030
uh,
we did a topic about sugar and fat about how,
you know,

2258
02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:27.980
Americans are like obsessed with,
uh,
uh,
cutting fat,
the low fat craze.
Right?

2259
02:02:28.630 --> 02:02:33.020
Um,
and a lot of that was,
uh,
uh,

2260
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:36.280
there,
there was an early research,
there's early research,
uh,

2261
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:40.040
by this one researcher who showed that a sugar costs a lot of heart disease,

2262
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:43.790
you know,
and obesity and stuff like that.
Um,
and the,
uh,

2263
02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:48.320
basically the sugar lobby shut him down,
you know,
um,
and uh,

2264
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:49.250
you know,
uh,

2265
02:02:49.251 --> 02:02:52.310
we're sort of funding research that really showed that that was the problem and

2266
02:02:52.311 --> 02:02:53.660
that research,
uh,

2267
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:57.450
sort of took over and that really led to the sort of anti-fat craze.
Right.

2268
02:02:57.650 --> 02:03:01.430
We did a story on that topic.
Um,
we later found out that like,

2269
02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:06.460
sort of the way that we had characterized the story of that happening was not a

2270
02:03:07.530 --> 02:03:10.280
accurate,
you know,
was or,
or does that make sense?
Like the,

2271
02:03:10.410 --> 02:03:13.740
the narrative part of it,
like it's true this guy's research existed.
Right?
Right.

2272
02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.670
Um,
it's true that the sugar lobby hated it,
you know,

2273
02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:19.180
but the research that showed that fat is bad,
you know,

2274
02:03:19.210 --> 02:03:21.050
that fat causes heart disease as well.

2275
02:03:21.230 --> 02:03:24.620
It wasn't like totally shitty research and like this sort of narrative isn't the

2276
02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:27.110
only reason that that other research fell out of favor.
Does that make sense?

2277
02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:31.190
And so,
uh,
we talked about that as a way that leg,

2278
02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:34.970
the story of there was this good guy researcher who is sort of like stifled by

2279
02:03:34.971 --> 02:03:36.380
the bad guy researcher in the lobby,

2280
02:03:36.710 --> 02:03:41.210
a sort of misled us down that down that path.
It's more complicated than that.

2281
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:43.970
Exactly.
And that's what happens when you're doing a show that has,
you know,

2282
02:03:43.971 --> 02:03:45.830
six minute segments,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

2283
02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:48.490
<v 3>That's what I was getting at.
It's like,
well,
when we were talking about earlier,</v>

2284
02:03:48.491 --> 02:03:51.400
like the times constraints on some subjects,

2285
02:03:51.401 --> 02:03:55.150
like think about how much time we spent just talked about Trans people and Trans

2286
02:03:55.151 --> 02:03:59.730
athletes,
maybe an hour at least to cis males talking about something.

2287
02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:00.970
You have no personal experience.

2288
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:03.550
And that's one of the reasons we've wanted to do that topic on the show.

2289
02:04:03.551 --> 02:04:04.181
But we're like,
man,

2290
02:04:04.181 --> 02:04:07.660
we really want to do justice to it and it's really hard to do in six minutes.

2291
02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:11.170
I'm looking to go longer in my,
in my career.

2292
02:04:11.171 --> 02:04:14.550
I'm looking to find ways to go longer.
Well,
why can't you do it online?
Like,

2293
02:04:14.590 --> 02:04:17.370
like say it,
that NCAA thing doesn't pay as well contract,

2294
02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:20.980
but do you have a clause in your contract to take some issues that you would

2295
02:04:20.981 --> 02:04:24.730
like to talk about and like that the,
the network wouldn't let you talk about,

2296
02:04:24.731 --> 02:04:28.890
look,
Ncaa couldn't you do like your own version of it?
Yeah,
totally.
I mean,
I,

2297
02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:32.710
I'd have to find a way to fund it,
you know,
definitely not.
Adam ruins everything.

2298
02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:36.580
I totally,
totally get that show.
I mean,
so far I've talked about it here.
Right?

2299
02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:37.860
Um,
and uh,

2300
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.660
<v 6>I I do want to say,
by the way we talk about the,</v>

2301
02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:43.410
the thing that we have a very cool network.
They,

2302
02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.060
that was the one time they ever called the topic.

2303
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.020
And what they did allow us to do was in an episode we have coming out later this

2304
02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:52.090
year,
we talk about on the show the fact that they killed that topic and we,

2305
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:53.900
we talked about how as you know,

2306
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:56.630
we're on advertising supported TV and occasionally we,

2307
02:04:56.650 --> 02:04:59.370
we tear into advertisers,
you know,

2308
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:01.740
and occasionally we have to have a conversation with the network or the network

2309
02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:02.220
says,
ah,

2310
02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:05.730
actually Gatorade kind of sponsors the network and you're talking about Gatorade

2311
02:05:05.970 --> 02:05:07.110
and then we have to have a conversation.

2312
02:05:07.111 --> 02:05:08.910
We still didn't get it did our Gatorade topic,

2313
02:05:08.911 --> 02:05:13.310
but we had to like have a talker too and know sugary sports drinks,
we talk,

2314
02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:18.210
we said okay,
all of the sports drinks overemphasize,
hydration as a problem,

2315
02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:21.660
you know.
Um,
uh,
and so we,
you know,

2316
02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:25.890
we did a whole segment examining how much does advertising effect the show.

2317
02:05:25.891 --> 02:05:28.230
Right.
And,
and as a result of the NCAA,

2318
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.140
we had to kill that segment and the network let us say that on TV.

2319
02:05:31.141 --> 02:05:32.670
So that was really,
that was really cool.

2320
02:05:32.671 --> 02:05:36.420
Then they allowed us to like bring up that conflict on the show.
But yeah,
no,

2321
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:38.580
there's nothing stopping me from going on the Internet.
It's just,

2322
02:05:38.610 --> 02:05:42.840
it just so happens that,
you know,
I'm a comic and,
uh,
you know,

2323
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:45.850
I had the wonderful opportunity.
I've always wanted to have my own TV show.

2324
02:05:45.851 --> 02:05:47.460
I had the wonderful opportunity to create one.

2325
02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:51.390
If I hadn't had that chance four or five years ago,
I would have,

2326
02:05:51.391 --> 02:05:54.220
I would probably be on youtube right now doing like,
you know,

2327
02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:57.210
hour long explainer videos with me doing jokes straight to camera.

2328
02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:01.770
And I love folks who do that,
like,
uh,
like,
uh,
uh,
and you know,
maybe I'll,

2329
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.280
maybe I'll find myself doing that again someday.

2330
02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.430
But right now I'm just like too busy making,

2331
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:09.270
it's hard enough doing 16 episodes a TV a year to like also figured out how to

2332
02:06:09.271 --> 02:06:12.390
write and research or thing that straight to camera.
But you can only imagine.

2333
02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:15.600
And you,
you did start out doing that,
right?
You started out on Youtube.
Yeah,

2334
02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:17.430
in college humor.
We,
uh,
uh,

2335
02:06:17.431 --> 02:06:21.120
I was a writer there and I developed a Adam ruins everything while I was there.

2336
02:06:21.121 --> 02:06:25.790
And then we sold it to true TV.
I will say on my,
on my live shows now,
um,

2337
02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:29.250
I,
I've just been on tour with my new show mind parasites,

2338
02:06:29.251 --> 02:06:31.440
which is like me trying to figure out how,
what I do,

2339
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:35.580
how to do what I do in a standup context,
right.
And so,
uh,

2340
02:06:35.581 --> 02:06:39.150
I took that all across the country.
I'm hoping to set up some more dates soon.
Um,

2341
02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:44.180
it's this really cool show about how these biological parasites that control

2342
02:06:44.191 --> 02:06:47.580
like their hosts,
minds,
like this fungus that takes control of an aunt and like,

2343
02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:51.710
um,
uh,
let's see,
uh,
a lot,
a lot of weird things.
Like,

2344
02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:54.330
it's like literally their minds become controlling this parasite that infects

2345
02:06:54.331 --> 02:06:56.340
them and they use that as a way to talk about,

2346
02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:58.620
I use that as a way to talk about the cultural parasites that are controlling

2347
02:06:58.650 --> 02:07:01.500
our minds,
like advertising,
like,
uh,

2348
02:07:01.501 --> 02:07:06.180
the social media algorithm like alcohol.
In my case,
I,
I quit drinking recently.

2349
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:10.770
How long ago?
Uh,
about a year ago.
Uh,
no,
not at all.

2350
02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:14.070
Not at all.
Not at all man.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

2351
02:07:14.071 --> 02:07:16.980
I know you'd love to get me in a Musk moments and a show me

2352
02:07:18.810 --> 02:07:23.550
a lot less news.
Very happy not drinking.
I lost a ton of weight right away.

2353
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:27.420
Well yeah,
I'll call is bad for you.
Uh,
but yeah,
so that's,

2354
02:07:27.421 --> 02:07:32.190
that show is me going longer.
Right?
And,
and I'm up on stage for like a theme.

2355
02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:34.980
It's a theme.
Yeah.
It's like got a title.
It's got a,

2356
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:36.520
it's got sections and I'm right here.

2357
02:07:36.710 --> 02:07:40.640
<v 2>It has a theme like in initially as you like have a framework for it.
Yeah.</v>

2358
02:07:40.710 --> 02:07:45.710
<v 6>Did I did and that was so hard to write because as a comic you're used to going</v>

2359
02:07:46.431 --> 02:07:49.190
up and just like,
well I'm just going to riff on a new idea.
Oh that's a chunk.

2360
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:51.560
And then I'll combine it with that other chunk and then that's my special.
Right.

2361
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:54.260
But I was like,
Hey,
I want to figure out a way to do what I do,

2362
02:07:54.261 --> 02:07:55.500
which is like come up with a,

2363
02:07:55.570 --> 02:07:59.570
an argument and a and some information and put it in a framework.
So I was like,

2364
02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:02.240
all right,
mind parasites,
I'll talk about these biological parasites.

2365
02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:05.000
I also want to go buy advertising time to write some jokes.

2366
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:08.210
And that was hard as hell to do it.
Felt like doing it backwards.

2367
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:12.420
But I worked it out a lot on stage and,
and eventually founded.

2368
02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:15.530
And the show's really a really clicking now.
I'm really a hardship

2369
02:08:15.630 --> 02:08:19.500
<v 2>PNR.
We're just talking about that cause Arusha fear is doing that with his most</v>

2370
02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:24.490
recent hour.
Who's his most recent recent hours?
Entirely about his,
uh,
history,

2371
02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.800
uh,
in Orthodox Judaism.

2372
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:31.690
Like he was a serious orthodox Jews spend a lot of time and uh,

2373
02:08:31.691 --> 02:08:32.980
in Israel,

2374
02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:37.030
like living in one of those religious commune type deals,

2375
02:08:37.031 --> 02:08:40.670
what do they call those rich yeshivas?
Oh yeah.
What they call it anyway.
Yeah,

2376
02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:42.160
I think,
yeah,
I think that's what it's called.
I mean,

2377
02:08:42.161 --> 02:08:46.960
he studied the Talmud and the tour.
I studied it all day long.
No,

2378
02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:51.550
that,
yeah.
I mean he's with 12 hours a day and then said this is nonsense.

2379
02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:53.980
The fuck am I doing?
And then became Ari.

2380
02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:58.450
And so his most recent special that he's in the middle of creating right now is

2381
02:08:58.451 --> 02:08:59.284
called Jew.

2382
02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:04.060
And it's the first time that he's ever done a total special from top to bottom

2383
02:09:04.061 --> 02:09:08.350
on one subject.
And he's piecing it together like a sort of,

2384
02:09:08.351 --> 02:09:11.650
in many ways it was influenced by some of the hours that he saw when he went to

2385
02:09:11.651 --> 02:09:13.750
Edinburgh.
Yeah.
And a saw the festival,

2386
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:16.450
but he'd said that he wanted to do it American style,

2387
02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:19.270
whereas they had these themes but they didn't necessarily emphasize the

2388
02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:21.420
punchlines and the standup and the left

2389
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:22.810
<v 6>I that's the same problem.
I,</v>

2390
02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:25.300
that's the same problem I had because when you're writing that way,

2391
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.180
you need to make a point and it's often hard.
Like you're like,
all right,

2392
02:09:28.181 --> 02:09:30.550
that joke was pretty good,
but I need,
I could juice it more,

2393
02:09:30.551 --> 02:09:32.320
but I need to get to the next point,
you know?

2394
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.570
And so that's a challenge with writing that way.

2395
02:09:34.571 --> 02:09:37.900
But I've just been doing it enough on stage that I've been able to like you,

2396
02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:40.210
you know,
like it's,
it's,
look,

2397
02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:42.490
I'm not going to say I'm the funniest guy on the planet and funniest

2398
02:09:42.491 --> 02:09:44.980
motherfucker ever,
but like,
it's got the punchlines I wanted to have,
you know?

2399
02:09:44.981 --> 02:09:45.640
That's awesome.

2400
02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:48.040
<v 2>Yeah,
it's cool.
The thing about it that way too,</v>

2401
02:09:48.041 --> 02:09:49.360
as a framework and then start from there.

2402
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:51.130
I know Chris Titus does it that way too.

2403
02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.320
A lot of guys do it that way where they'll,

2404
02:09:53.321 --> 02:09:57.850
they'll try to make a framework and then have all their ideas fit inside of that

2405
02:09:57.851 --> 02:09:58.590
frame.

2406
02:09:58.590 --> 02:09:59.670
<v 6>Yeah.
I mean,
the,</v>

2407
02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:03.390
the thing that I found out is the reason people ask me how I got into this,

2408
02:10:03.391 --> 02:10:07.560
you know,
and I was just a comic in New York,
just going up on stage.
And you know,

2409
02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:09.090
after awhile you learn how to make people laugh,

2410
02:10:09.091 --> 02:10:12.390
but you don't know how to make people give a shit about you.
Right?
Like,
okay,

2411
02:10:12.391 --> 02:10:15.630
Greg,
I'm forcing audience to make a noise all at once.
You know what I mean?

2412
02:10:15.631 --> 02:10:17.190
But I can't make them remember me.
Right.

2413
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:20.730
And so when I started talking about the stuff that I've learned,
you know,

2414
02:10:20.731 --> 02:10:23.070
I'm just an information sponge,
I just pick up shit like this,
you know?

2415
02:10:23.250 --> 02:10:24.900
And I started talking about,
you know,
Oh,

2416
02:10:24.901 --> 02:10:28.440
do you know that the diamond engagement ring was a scam on the part of the Beers

2417
02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.690
Corporation in the 30s and everyone just forgotten that we think it's tradition,

2418
02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:32.370
right?
That was the first one I ever did that with us.

2419
02:10:32.371 --> 02:10:35.840
My most sort of sit famous signature bed.
People start paying more attention,

2420
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.650
you know,
and uh,
like,
oh my God,
I didn't realize that,
you know,

2421
02:10:39.651 --> 02:10:42.260
and now I'm in this weird niche,
no one else does what I do.

2422
02:10:42.261 --> 02:10:47.060
I do like educational investigative comedy,
right?
When you watch me,
you laugh.

2423
02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:51.350
And then also you learn some mind blowing shit that you're going to remember a

2424
02:10:51.351 --> 02:10:54.230
year from now,
you know?
And no one else is doing it.

2425
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:58.520
And so the cool thing about it is when I go up there,
I'm not running in this,

2426
02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.380
you said earlier,
make your own race,
you know,

2427
02:11:00.381 --> 02:11:03.170
or like don't run the same race as everybody else.
Every other comic,

2428
02:11:03.171 --> 02:11:05.980
I'm like every other comics trying to win the hundred meter dash and maybe you

2429
02:11:05.981 --> 02:11:08.360
bolt's bolts in the race with them,
right?
That's Bill Burr,
whoever.

2430
02:11:08.361 --> 02:11:11.060
You know what I mean?
Usain bolt's trying to beat him and they're like,
fuck,

2431
02:11:11.061 --> 02:11:13.370
I can be pretty fast,
but I'm never gonna be number one.
You know,

2432
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:16.640
I'm running a race.
I'm the only person doing this.
You know,
like I,

2433
02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:20.180
I'm just doing a race off to the side where like my show,

2434
02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:24.080
if you go to see bill Byrd,
there's more punchlines per second per sure.
For sure.

2435
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:26.960
Right?
You're,
you're going to,
you're,
uh,
but I,
my show,

2436
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.840
you're going to learn about some weird bugs and you're going to think

2437
02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:32.440
differently about social media.
You know,
you're going to,

2438
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:35.360
you're going to come away with a new idea.
And so that's what I have to offer.

2439
02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:37.360
Yeah.
I've engineered it that way.
And,

2440
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:40.760
and so that's what I try to tell other comics when they're just talking,

2441
02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:42.860
you know,
when people see my show and I'm like,
oh,
how'd you write this?
I'm like,

2442
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:46.610
just figure out what you can give people that other people aren't giving them,

2443
02:11:46.670 --> 02:11:50.150
you know?
And like it's possible to write in a different,
in a different way.

2444
02:11:50.151 --> 02:11:52.220
You know?
I miss doing straight state,

2445
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:55.430
like I have my straight standup hour or I just go and I tell you my stupid

2446
02:11:55.431 --> 02:11:59.360
observations about Shit,
you know?
Um,
and I love doing that material,

2447
02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:02.870
but that material is not going to get me a Netflix special,
you know,

2448
02:12:02.871 --> 02:12:05.410
because it's not different enough.
You know?

2449
02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:06.191
<v 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

2450
02:12:06.191 --> 02:12:09.900
So you've kind of like know you have a strategy for a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2451
02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:13.120
That's also what I want to talk about.
It's not just cynical,
but yeah.

2452
02:12:13.150 --> 02:12:16.810
It's not like you're being disingenuous.
This is who you are.
Yeah.

2453
02:12:16.811 --> 02:12:19.990
It's cool that you found a niche like that you found this little groove that you

2454
02:12:19.991 --> 02:12:21.850
could cut into and I'm just working on,

2455
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:25.390
I have a few bits that I do that are scientific reality that people don't

2456
02:12:25.391 --> 02:12:29.770
believe in that or that people wouldn't imagine until you hear about it,

2457
02:12:29.771 --> 02:12:31.420
particularly biological stuff.
But,

2458
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:35.290
but mine parasites is one that we've brought up in this podcast a fucking

2459
02:12:35.291 --> 02:12:38.740
thousand times.
We had some Polsky on,
Oh,
who's that?
Uh,

2460
02:12:38.770 --> 02:12:40.090
Robert Sapolsky from Stanford,

2461
02:12:40.091 --> 02:12:43.930
who's a top researcher and one of the top researchers has talked to talk a,

2462
02:12:44.250 --> 02:12:46.630
<v 6>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I talk about that a little bit in my,
in my show,</v>

2463
02:12:46.890 --> 02:12:48.760
listen to his lectures on it's chlorine.

2464
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:53.700
That stuff is nuts to toxoplasmosis is wild.
15 million Americans have it.

2465
02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:55.170
Yeah.
Probably me.
Yeah.

2466
02:12:56.010 --> 02:13:00.240
In your brain that the parasite and my understanding,
I want you,

2467
02:13:00.241 --> 02:13:02.400
I got this guy's research,
the research that I saw was like,

2468
02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:06.690
not quite definitive enough to be able to say this affects your behavior.
Right?

2469
02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:10.260
It's like they think maybe,
probably.
So.
I was like,
that's not enough for me,

2470
02:13:10.290 --> 02:13:14.130
for my show.
But like,
so,
you know,
I talk about,
but I,
you know,

2471
02:13:14.131 --> 02:13:18.120
what I talk about is the way that like,
the social media algorithm,
right.
Um,

2472
02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:21.240
is designed,
it's just like evolution,
right?
It's like,

2473
02:13:21.241 --> 02:13:24.000
it's just testing on you every single second year online.

2474
02:13:24.001 --> 02:13:27.960
And instead of trying to see whether the genes perpetuate themselves,

2475
02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:32.190
this test is saying,
can I get you to click a interested,
are you upset?

2476
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.570
<v 2>Are you gonna engage?
Exactly.</v>

2477
02:13:33.571 --> 02:13:35.340
And the best way to get you engaged to piss you off.

2478
02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.630
<v 6>Exactly.
And if I can get you to click,</v>

2479
02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:40.660
all they do is they just reproduce that same stimuli with little changes,

2480
02:13:40.661 --> 02:13:42.280
just like evolution.
And by doing that,

2481
02:13:42.281 --> 02:13:45.610
they're able to control our behavior in a real fucking way.
And people know this,

2482
02:13:45.611 --> 02:13:46.990
you know,
but it really is

2483
02:13:47.150 --> 02:13:50.150
<v 2>happening to you.
Do you,
um,
listen at Sam Harris' podcast?
Uh,</v>

2484
02:13:50.151 --> 02:13:52.310
I've heard a couple times.
Yeah.
He's got a great one.

2485
02:13:52.311 --> 02:13:54.700
I'm pulling it up right now that I just recommend.
Yes.

2486
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.020
If I'm going to recommend it again cause it that fucking good.

2487
02:13:57.260 --> 02:14:00.590
And it's a about Facebook and about how this is all set up.

2488
02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:03.130
It's called the trouble with Facebook.
And uh,

2489
02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:08.060
the guy's name is Roger Mcnamee,
n.

2490
02:14:08.090 --> 02:14:10.870
E.
M.
E.
E,
but it's a episode one 52.
Yeah.

2491
02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.670
But it's really fascinating because one of the things they take into

2492
02:14:13.671 --> 02:14:16.040
consideration is that this company,

2493
02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:19.340
Facebook makes their money off of collecting your data.

2494
02:14:19.341 --> 02:14:21.590
The best way to collect your data is to get you to engage.

2495
02:14:21.591 --> 02:14:24.260
The best way to get you to engage.
It's put things in your newsfeed,

2496
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:28.500
they're going to piss you off.
And it's like there's this division that's,

2497
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:33.200
that's rising in this country is coincides with social media.

2498
02:14:33.201 --> 02:14:34.430
And it's not coincidentally,

2499
02:14:34.610 --> 02:14:37.130
<v 6>and here's the thing,
they don't even,</v>

2500
02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:40.700
the really fucked up part is the people who created these algorithms,

2501
02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.440
that is not their intent.

2502
02:14:42.590 --> 02:14:45.920
They're not trying to piss you off and they're not trying to create division.

2503
02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:47.450
All they're doing is they're like,
look,

2504
02:14:47.451 --> 02:14:50.150
we just want people spend as much time on the site as possible.
Algorithm,

2505
02:14:50.210 --> 02:14:52.930
watch what they're doing and give them more like that.
Right?
And then,

2506
02:14:52.931 --> 02:14:54.430
so it's happening accidentally.
Yeah.

2507
02:14:54.431 --> 02:14:56.660
And so then when we're all looking at Facebook on like,

2508
02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:59.400
look what Facebook is doing,
they're like,
what are you talking about?
Right.

2509
02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:02.120
It's just about,
we don't need to change anything.
You know?
Um,

2510
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:07.250
we just have an algorithm rewards engagement.
Yeah.
I know,
I know that you,

2511
02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:10.400
I know that you had a Jack Dorsey on,
I did not hear that interview.

2512
02:15:10.401 --> 02:15:15.230
I just know you had him on.
I know that people are pissed off at,
you know,
like,

2513
02:15:15.610 --> 02:15:15.970
um,

2514
02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:20.720
and my own personal pissed off with them is that like they don't,

2515
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:23.330
they don't take enough ownership of it,
you know,
like,
and,
and that's not just,

2516
02:15:23.331 --> 02:15:27.110
I don't wanna just focus on Dorsey Zuckerberg is the worst with it,
you know,
um,

2517
02:15:27.140 --> 02:15:28.460
that they,
uh,

2518
02:15:28.461 --> 02:15:32.060
these algorithms are causing these behaviors and then they're saying,
oh,

2519
02:15:32.061 --> 02:15:34.820
that's not,
oh well,
no,
we're not doing that.
We've just like,

2520
02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:37.640
we're just trying to get people to be on the site more like,

2521
02:15:37.670 --> 02:15:40.670
it's to connect people and so they don't change it.

2522
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:45.210
<v 2>Well,
what if they had no algorithm?
What if they just allowed it to exist as a,</v>

2523
02:15:45.211 --> 02:15:48.260
just a,
a virtual message board?
You know,
Twitter,
no,
moderate

2524
02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:52.120
<v 6>Twitter.
Well that's,
that's a problem itself,
right?
Cause like that's like,
okay,</v>

2525
02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:56.650
a virtual message board with no moderators is like,
um,
like let,

2526
02:15:56.651 --> 02:15:58.890
let's just talk about fighting for instance,
right?
Like,
okay,

2527
02:15:58.930 --> 02:16:02.860
when you've got a UFC fight,
right,
you've got to referee,
right?

2528
02:16:02.861 --> 02:16:06.490
You've got a situation you've created,
you've got,
you got to a ring,

2529
02:16:06.730 --> 02:16:08.920
you know you've set things up.
So hey,
people are going to get hurt,

2530
02:16:08.921 --> 02:16:13.180
but not more than you want them to write.
A No moderators.
That's like,
Hey,

2531
02:16:13.181 --> 02:16:17.710
let's have a street fight with nobody watching,
right?
No one's,
there's no rules.

2532
02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:19.270
There's an unlimited number of people in there.

2533
02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:21.250
It's just people wailing on each other where people are going to get hurt.

2534
02:16:21.330 --> 02:16:25.110
You know?
So like I think when you are,
uh,

2535
02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:29.530
creating the platform,
you're creating the place where the discussion happening,

2536
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:32.590
you have a responsibility for what kind of discussion happens in that place.

2537
02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:35.200
You know,
because you're the one who set up the ground rules.

2538
02:16:35.630 --> 02:16:37.550
<v 3>They're trying to do that with youtube for awhile.</v>

2539
02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:41.150
They were trying to say that like if you have a youtube page and your comments

2540
02:16:41.151 --> 02:16:44.540
are filled with antisemitic hate that you can get in trouble for that,

2541
02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:47.780
but you were supposed to clean up your comments and then people went,

2542
02:16:47.781 --> 02:16:51.020
what the fuck are you talking about?
And Youtube was like,
ah,
forget it.
Yeah.

2543
02:16:51.021 --> 02:16:51.860
So I backed off

2544
02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:55.870
<v 6>on Youtube.
Right.
That's youtube.
Youtube is the one that allowed that to happen.</v>

2545
02:16:55.871 --> 02:16:58.350
The con is that Youtube is the one saying that we're not going to moderate any,

2546
02:16:59.060 --> 02:17:01.760
<v 3>could they?
How can they,
well,
I mean you,
you,</v>

2547
02:17:01.761 --> 02:17:05.000
you literally need physical moderators.
Yeah,
I know.

2548
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:08.000
And then that's the contradiction that they're faced with the people.

2549
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:11.510
There's so many people.
Yeah.
And this is the issue with Facebook.

2550
02:17:11.511 --> 02:17:14.600
This is the issue with Twitter.
The real question is like,

2551
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:18.530
who gets to decide what is offensive?
What is not?

2552
02:17:18.531 --> 02:17:22.790
I'm sure you're aware of the learn to code fiasco.
Uh,
oh.

2553
02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:27.440
I planned to her hand for saying learn to code.

2554
02:17:27.710 --> 02:17:32.690
And it was really mocking this idea that people were telling coal miners who are

2555
02:17:32.691 --> 02:17:36.850
losing their jobs,
you know,
hey,
there's jobs in computer programming this out,

2556
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:38.630
you should learn to code.

2557
02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:43.130
And so people started mocking people by saying learn to code and then learn to

2558
02:17:43.131 --> 02:17:46.070
code.
Apparently according to Jack Dorsey and Vigia,

2559
02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:50.270
it got connected to a antisemetic remarks and hate remarks.

2560
02:17:51.050 --> 02:17:56.040
And then I decided out this level of Internet,
Internet nonsense.
Fascinating.

2561
02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:58.700
Because that doesn't mean anything like learn to code is not offensive.

2562
02:17:58.701 --> 02:17:59.240
It's like,
yeah,

2563
02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.780
well it's ridiculous to ask a 50 year old man as a coal miner to learn to code

2564
02:18:02.781 --> 02:18:05.870
and it doesn't have a formal education.
That is ridiculous.

2565
02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:08.600
But I mean the fact that you get banned for life for saying that.

2566
02:18:08.601 --> 02:18:09.990
So that's actually even more Riddick.

2567
02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:15.540
<v 6>Yeah.
But then there are cases where people go and they try to create like a,</v>

2568
02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.610
if someone,
if someone who look there are antisemites out there,
right.

2569
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:24.450
They do try to come up with like ways to indicate antisemitism to each other

2570
02:18:24.451 --> 02:18:27.960
that other people won't detect.
You know what I mean?
Via you know,
slang.

2571
02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:31.110
Basically her slang.
Right?
Um,
and,
uh,

2572
02:18:31.111 --> 02:18:33.900
at some point someone needs to be able to say,
okay,
wait one second,
this is,

2573
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:37.000
we figured out this an 87 x slang,
so we're not going to allow you to say it.

2574
02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:38.790
You know what I mean?
It's like shit,
like 88 or what,

2575
02:18:38.791 --> 02:18:40.070
isn't that a thing where it's like,
yes,

2576
02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:42.090
<v 3>yeah.
H H how Hitler</v>

2577
02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:43.870
<v 6>the problem,
right?
There's the,</v>

2578
02:18:43.871 --> 02:18:48.040
this is the exact problem that you're talking about.
Um,
so,
but the contrary,

2579
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:50.890
the contradiction that all of these platforms have,
right,

2580
02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:55.240
is the early days of the Internet.
Remember the early days it was like,
uh,

2581
02:18:55.540 --> 02:19:00.540
people were really concerned that people would start suing websites because of

2582
02:19:00.931 --> 02:19:04.870
what was on the website,
right?
Like,
um,
like the pirate bay,
the big torrent site,

2583
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:07.300
you know,
like you're gonna get sued because you've got DVD screeners on there.

2584
02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:09.550
No hold.
I said,
we're just,
this is just where people can upload the shit.

2585
02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:12.690
You know,
Google getting sued because they would,
you know,

2586
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.360
direct someone or the DVDs crunch,
they searched for leaks,
DVD screener,

2587
02:19:16.361 --> 02:19:17.194
you know what I mean?

2588
02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:19.780
And so that was a big concern in the early days of the Internet,
right?

2589
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:22.120
And so we established this precedent that like,
no,
no,
no,

2590
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:24.790
these sites don't have responsibility for that right there.

2591
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:28.070
Just how people are connecting to things.
They're not people doing the bad shit,

2592
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:29.830
right?
You go over the people doing the batch shit,

2593
02:19:29.850 --> 02:19:34.730
not the people who made it possible to find the bad shit.
Right now though,

2594
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:36.710
we're in such a place where,

2595
02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:39.650
so all these businesses built themselves on the idea of youtube,
right?

2596
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:41.960
We don't make anything right.
Youtube,

2597
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:45.860
we just give you a place to upload your videos,
right?
So at first that's fine.

2598
02:19:45.861 --> 02:19:48.860
All right.
Just take down the antisemitic,
you know,
white supremacy videos,
right?

2599
02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:53.450
Whatever.
Right?
But now there's so,
so many of them.
Right?
And also,
not only that,

2600
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.730
Youtube's algorithm is directing people towards them,

2601
02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.380
and Youtube is selling ads against them and making money at them.
Right?
Um,

2602
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:04.970
and at the same time,
like,
you know,
these,
these videos exist,
right?
Um,
uh,

2603
02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:07.220
and,
uh,
at the same time,
there's still trying to say,
well,

2604
02:20:07.221 --> 02:20:09.440
we had no responsibility for that happened.
[inaudible],

2605
02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:14.520
you guys built a system where any kind of content is allowed and you are,

2606
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:17.690
you've also got the sentence and that's directing people to that content and you

2607
02:20:17.691 --> 02:20:19.700
build a system that's making money off of that content.

2608
02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:21.920
Think you guys have a little bit of responsibility.
Now.

2609
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:25.400
I agree that the question of who polices it or whatever,

2610
02:20:25.401 --> 02:20:27.830
that's an extremely complicated conversation.

2611
02:20:27.831 --> 02:20:30.350
But like that's what I'm just saying about these companies trying to have it

2612
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:31.011
both ways.

2613
02:20:31.011 --> 02:20:35.000
They're trying to say we have no responsibility for what's on the platform,

2614
02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:39.590
but also we've allowed this kind of content to go up,
you know,

2615
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:44.320
<v 3>don't know if you to profits on antisemetic videos.</v>

2616
02:20:44.370 --> 02:20:45.203
I don't know.

2617
02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:50.620
I talk about in my show of a demonetizing aspect of youtube that affects people

2618
02:20:52.061 --> 02:20:55.060
whenever anything's even remotely controversial,
controversial.

2619
02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:58.710
<v 6>They've started,
they've started doing that.
Um,
up until like,
there was a case,</v>

2620
02:20:58.711 --> 02:21:01.440
I talk about it in my show,
um,
uh,
like a year,

2621
02:21:01.470 --> 02:21:05.080
year or two ago where they were like running under Armour brand a underarmour

2622
02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.580
ads on like white supremacy,
youtube videos,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

2623
02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:10.990
And that that was like,
and their algorithm was causing this,

2624
02:21:11.250 --> 02:21:12.450
what's causing that to happen?
Right?

2625
02:21:12.451 --> 02:21:14.940
And these are videos getting a hundred thousands of hits and it was like major

2626
02:21:14.941 --> 02:21:16.710
brands and those brands found out.
Oh Wow.

2627
02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:19.830
<v 3>Wow.
And then the title of these video,
like we'll kind of,
we'll get on it.</v>

2628
02:21:19.831 --> 02:21:21.630
They say obvious antisemitic thing.

2629
02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.910
<v 6>These were,
these were obvious enough that anybody would be pissed off about him.</v>

2630
02:21:24.911 --> 02:21:29.650
Yeah.
Um,
and uh,
so that's where the demonetization thing came from,
right?

2631
02:21:29.651 --> 02:21:32.740
Because they're like,
oh shit,
now the people who actually pay us,

2632
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:35.920
the advertisers are pissed off,
right?
Yeah.
So,
okay,

2633
02:21:35.921 --> 02:21:38.590
let's put a bandaid on the problem and let's do monetize videos.
Right?

2634
02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:40.330
Here's the problem.
Now they're doing that.

2635
02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:42.010
They're just doing that algorithmically,
right?

2636
02:21:42.011 --> 02:21:44.020
They're choosing which videos to demonetize algorithmically.

2637
02:21:44.021 --> 02:21:46.210
So sometimes they demonetize stuff that they shouldn't.

2638
02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:49.900
That's definitely happened a ton and a lot of shit is still getting through the

2639
02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:53.410
cracks,
you know?
And again,
they're saying,
okay,
we did what we did,

2640
02:21:53.411 --> 02:21:54.191
what we had to know.

2641
02:21:54.191 --> 02:21:57.130
You guys didn't solve the fucking problem because now people are pissed off

2642
02:21:57.131 --> 02:21:57.964
again.
Right.

2643
02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:02.320
So that is the vine that these companies rent there based on this premise of we

2644
02:22:02.321 --> 02:22:05.380
don't moderate,
moderate anything.
But when you do that,

2645
02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:08.590
a lot of shit comes in and now you're in the position where,
sorry,

2646
02:22:08.591 --> 02:22:10.720
it's still your house.
The Shit's happened in your house.

2647
02:22:10.810 --> 02:22:13.990
You had through the House party dude.
Like stuff like the base got broken.

2648
02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:14.621
It's your fault.

2649
02:22:14.621 --> 02:22:17.200
At the end of the day you have to take some responsibility for it.
And then,

2650
02:22:17.201 --> 02:22:19.060
well how am I supposed to police do a hundred kids?
I don't know.

2651
02:22:19.061 --> 02:22:22.990
You're the one who threw the party.
That's a good analogy because it sits right.

2652
02:22:23.050 --> 02:22:26.790
<v 3>The scale.
That's the problem.
It's probably more like 200,000 kids in a house.</v>

2653
02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:29.520
Totally.
Cause it's,
there's,
it's unmanageable.
Yeah.

2654
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:32.190
When you think about how many different people are on youtube and how many

2655
02:22:32.191 --> 02:22:34.560
different countries are uploading videos and you know,

2656
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:37.260
some of them are isis beheading videos.
Those,
those,

2657
02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.580
like there's a bunch of cartel videos that people have sent me to on Youtube and

2658
02:22:41.581 --> 02:22:43.560
they stay up for a little while.
Yeah.
You know,

2659
02:22:43.561 --> 02:22:46.350
you get to watch some horrible shit for a little while before they catch on.

2660
02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:47.530
Or like I talk about these

2661
02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:50.840
<v 6>videos,
uh,
in my show where like the,</v>

2662
02:22:50.841 --> 02:22:54.210
the weird nonsense kids videos on youtube where it's like people in Spiderman

2663
02:22:54.211 --> 02:22:57.360
costumes doing like weird community theater.
You know what I mean?

2664
02:22:57.361 --> 02:23:01.050
In like Spiderman,
Elsa videos or like so strange.

2665
02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:04.440
There's so many,
if you look at kids youtube,
it's still so full of it.

2666
02:23:04.441 --> 02:23:07.590
Like they've tried to stamp it out.
There's still tons of it.
And these videos,

2667
02:23:07.591 --> 02:23:10.470
like literally I show a video,
which is just total nonsense,

2668
02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:11.730
like looks like it was made by a computer.

2669
02:23:11.731 --> 02:23:14.820
It's just weird garbage doesn't look wrong until you actually watch it closely.

2670
02:23:14.821 --> 02:23:16.860
And then you're like,
this video is saying we are nonsense.

2671
02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:21.900
The video has 600 million views,
right?
And it's just garbage.

2672
02:23:21.901 --> 02:23:22.380
Right?

2673
02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:26.640
And I have literally spent my whole life trying to make good internet content,

2674
02:23:26.641 --> 02:23:30.390
make condoms the funny entertaining that people like and I can't get close to

2675
02:23:30.391 --> 02:23:31.021
that number to hits.

2676
02:23:31.021 --> 02:23:34.170
And it's because the algorithm is controlling what people are watching,
right?

2677
02:23:34.171 --> 02:23:36.690
So penny towards people towards nonsense.

2678
02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:37.510
<v 3>Well,</v>

2679
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:40.930
so that people are watching this because it has Elsa or Spiderman or they're

2680
02:23:40.931 --> 02:23:41.560
watching this,

2681
02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:44.620
<v 6>they're watching it because they're a five year old and the video was given to</v>

2682
02:23:44.621 --> 02:23:49.621
them up next by youtube and the video's title and key words and like content has

2683
02:23:50.171 --> 02:23:51.640
managed to hack the algorithm,

2684
02:23:51.641 --> 02:23:55.210
find the weird edge case in the algorithm that put it in front of those kids

2685
02:23:55.211 --> 02:23:56.044
over and over it.

2686
02:23:56.050 --> 02:23:59.230
<v 3>You've seen the ones where they break down those videos where it's weird like</v>

2687
02:23:59.231 --> 02:24:01.910
there's always like a baby and alcohol.
Yep.

2688
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:05.170
And someone always gets hurt from a broken bottle like you over and over and

2689
02:24:05.171 --> 02:24:06.240
over again.
These things happen.

2690
02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:09.670
They do that because it's sort of like they've found that people that make those

2691
02:24:09.690 --> 02:24:13.200
<v 6>videos have found how to hack the out because algorithms are not that smart.</v>

2692
02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:16.500
Right?
They're not brilliant things.
They're just like a little bit of code.

2693
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:18.300
It's just like in a video game you don't have,

2694
02:24:18.301 --> 02:24:21.090
when you're playing a video game and you like figure out,
you're like,
oh,

2695
02:24:21.091 --> 02:24:24.480
the video game thinks that when x happens.
I'm trying to do why,

2696
02:24:24.481 --> 02:24:27.290
but now that I figured that out,
I can exploit that.
Right,
right.

2697
02:24:27.350 --> 02:24:29.100
I can figure out how to freeze that guy in place or,

2698
02:24:29.101 --> 02:24:31.110
or just like when you're a kid and you could figure how to scroll.

2699
02:24:31.111 --> 02:24:34.110
The enemy's off the screen in nes games go left then.
Right.
Oh,
they disappear.

2700
02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.720
You know,
you'd figure out how to,
how to hack the algorithm.

2701
02:24:36.721 --> 02:24:40.020
That's what the people who make these videos have done with the algorithm as

2702
02:24:40.021 --> 02:24:41.150
well.
They figured out a little whole

2703
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:43.790
<v 3>in a way that works and they forgot it.
Oh,
if we just do this,</v>

2704
02:24:43.791 --> 02:24:47.090
the video gets shown again and again and again.
And here's the thing,

2705
02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.040
70% of all videos watched on youtube are being served by the algorithm.

2706
02:24:51.041 --> 02:24:54.410
70% people are watching a billion hours of youtube a day.
So,

2707
02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:58.250
so people are not choosing what we're watching the algorithms choosing and the

2708
02:24:58.251 --> 02:24:59.780
people that the video is,

2709
02:24:59.781 --> 02:25:02.960
the algorithm is showing us are the ones that people are like hacking.
You know,

2710
02:25:02.970 --> 02:25:06.480
I like these weird fucked up video,
my shoulder,
this algorithm.
Yeah,

2711
02:25:06.530 --> 02:25:07.610
that is really interesting.

2712
02:25:07.611 --> 02:25:10.130
And it's also interesting that these companies have figured this thing out.

2713
02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:14.300
Like A,
I don't know if you ever get,
you see,
um,
like whenever I post something,

2714
02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:17.510
um,
they're always be like if I post something on Instagram,

2715
02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.850
there'll be look within the first,
second or two,

2716
02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:24.070
four or five of these accounts that like a,
are you just going to pretend

2717
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:27.100
<v 5>I don't have a giant booty?
And you're like,
what is this?</v>

2718
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:32.310
And you go to it and it's some weird sneaky sort of computer generated thing

2719
02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:35.500
where it'll say it on with a bunch of different accounts.

2720
02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:39.730
The exact same thing with emojis and then you go to it and it's some ripped off

2721
02:25:39.731 --> 02:25:43.180
pictures of some girl with a big ass,
right?
Yeah.
And then somehow or another,

2722
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:44.080
the trying to get you,

2723
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:49.290
but they've capitalized on this comment section to find people that have posts

2724
02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:54.040
that get a lot of comments and you get a lot of views and then they go right to

2725
02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:57.760
it.
And then that's how they tap into it.
And that's my point of,

2726
02:25:57.850 --> 02:26:00.910
of how this works,
right?
So Instagram set up a set up a comment system.

2727
02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:03.670
These people have figured out how to hack the comment system to get their

2728
02:26:03.671 --> 02:26:05.610
bullshit spam on the top within seconds.

2729
02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:08.260
I mean it's so fast they couldn't possibly have written it yet.

2730
02:26:08.261 --> 02:26:10.600
Like it has to be a program and that's,

2731
02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:13.840
and that's Instagram's fault for allowing that to happen at the end of the day.

2732
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:16.570
You know what I mean?
Like that's Instagram's problem to solve.
You know?

2733
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:18.580
And that's the problem.
All of these platforms have that.

2734
02:26:18.581 --> 02:26:21.610
The Prime Youtube has as a problem Twitter has.
And so whenever they say,
oh no,

2735
02:26:21.611 --> 02:26:24.430
it's just a couple of bad apples,
it's like you guys threw the party,

2736
02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:28.440
you guys figured out how to fix it.
Right?
Shitty orchardson yeah.

2737
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:32.780
I mean youtube is amazing in that,
you know,

2738
02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:36.880
you really can be entertained with things like for someone who's into obscure

2739
02:26:36.881 --> 02:26:39.680
things in particular,
it's one of the best resources ever.

2740
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:43.450
I a career off of Youtube.
Yeah.
I mean it's,

2741
02:26:43.451 --> 02:26:45.790
but it's also like if you want to watch old things,

2742
02:26:45.791 --> 02:26:47.200
you want to watch interesting things.
I mean,

2743
02:26:47.201 --> 02:26:50.770
you can find almost everything on youtube,

2744
02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:52.960
including things that are not true.
Let's,

2745
02:26:52.961 --> 02:26:56.470
this is like whether cracking down on certain things like earth videos,

2746
02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:58.090
it's a library of Alexandria man.

2747
02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.350
Like I remember there used to be like in New York,
uh,

2748
02:27:02.351 --> 02:27:03.430
I never actually went and did this,

2749
02:27:03.431 --> 02:27:07.330
but there was like a museum that had like lots of old archival TV.
You know,

2750
02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:07.901
you could go back,

2751
02:27:07.901 --> 02:27:10.030
you could watch the first episode of Johnny Carson or whatever.

2752
02:27:10.031 --> 02:27:12.460
You know what I mean?
I was like,
oh,
that's so cool right now.

2753
02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:15.070
You don't need to go to that library.
You can just,
it's literally on Youtube.

2754
02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:18.560
The first episode of Johnny Carson ever is on Youtube was the guest.
Uh,

2755
02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:21.880
I don't remember.
Um,
I don't think I'm exaggerating.
I have seen it on the web.

2756
02:27:21.881 --> 02:27:25.360
I saw like his very first appearance.
Sure.
It's up there,
or at least the early,

2757
02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:27.610
you know,
cause maybe the early ones weren't taped,
but it was like super,

2758
02:27:27.611 --> 02:27:31.930
super early.
It's got like black hair,
you know?
Wow.
Um,
and so like,
you know,

2759
02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:36.700
every episode of the daily show ever is on the Internet,
you know,
and so,
uh,

2760
02:27:36.701 --> 02:27:40.940
and you know,
say you like,
uh,
you know,
name a Sonos,
Sonos,
I go send,

2761
02:27:40.970 --> 02:27:43.270
I just go watch a,
you know,
name an old jazz musician.
You can,

2762
02:27:43.271 --> 02:27:44.920
won't go watch him play live.
You know what I mean?

2763
02:27:44.930 --> 02:27:47.410
We watched the loneliest monk closeups of his hands,
you know what I mean?

2764
02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:51.310
That's incredible.
That's incredible.
And so like,

2765
02:27:51.430 --> 02:27:56.230
and I still hope in my heart of hearts that like that is at the end of the day,

2766
02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:59.470
Youtube is serving a good purpose because we still have access to all that

2767
02:27:59.471 --> 02:28:03.100
information.
You know,
my videos do pretty well on youtube.
My videos aren't,

2768
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:07.450
aren't white supremacist,
you know,
Spiderman nonsense,
they're good,
you know,

2769
02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:10.090
so hopefully they're doing some good in the world.
But at the,
you know,

2770
02:28:10.330 --> 02:28:12.580
I as I hope in my heart of hearts that like,
you know,

2771
02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:15.520
this is still a positive force for humanity.
I think it's a positive for us.

2772
02:28:15.521 --> 02:28:17.830
But overall,
the problem that we're talking about,

2773
02:28:17.831 --> 02:28:20.920
whether it's problem with youtube or the problem with the Facebook algorithm,

2774
02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:21.860
any of these things,

2775
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:24.860
<v 3>it's people that suck.
That's the problem.
Yeah,
it's not,</v>

2776
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:28.130
it's not people that are putting up videos of Thelonious monk.
It's not,
you know,

2777
02:28:28.131 --> 02:28:31.640
someone making something educational on vitamins or something like that.

2778
02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:34.640
It's bullshit.
The bullshit,
the problem,

2779
02:28:34.641 --> 02:28:39.020
the problem is people exploiting the system and using that system to stick

2780
02:28:39.021 --> 02:28:41.030
nonsense or,
or bad things up there,

2781
02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:44.450
but if you're the company that's allowing that bullshit to happen and you make

2782
02:28:44.451 --> 02:28:48.680
money off of it,
you know it's an issue,
but it's also,

2783
02:28:48.681 --> 02:28:51.290
it's like part of it is a really interesting to me,
like part,

2784
02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:52.970
I don't like the fact that it's all this.

2785
02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:56.120
I don't like the fact that there's some ungodly number of kids.

2786
02:28:56.121 --> 02:28:58.950
I think the fucking world is flat because they watched a youtube video and there

2787
02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.510
was no one who is there while the guy was making the youtube video to go stop.

2788
02:29:02.511 --> 02:29:05.750
That's not true.
I'll show you how.
This is how you do it.
There you go.

2789
02:29:05.751 --> 02:29:08.930
There's the data.
Okay,
next.
Keep going.
Stop.
That's not true either.

2790
02:29:08.931 --> 02:29:11.360
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Of course it works like that.

2791
02:29:11.361 --> 02:29:13.460
This is why it works like that.
And this is what it means.

2792
02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:15.710
Did you see our video on the moon landing?
No.
Oh,

2793
02:29:15.711 --> 02:29:16.790
this is one of my favorite videos.

2794
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:19.970
<v 6>Did.
So,
uh,
you know,
it's about how the moon land,</v>

2795
02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:22.760
th the thesis is the moon landing could not have been faked.

2796
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:26.640
It would have been harder to fake the moon landing then it would have been to

2797
02:29:26.930 --> 02:29:31.930
actually go to the moon because the technology to fake it did not exist when we

2798
02:29:32.031 --> 02:29:36.620
talked to a,
uh,
forensic film guy.
Right?
And he was like,
spins.

2799
02:29:36.621 --> 02:29:41.090
He's got like a,
he's got a fucking Oscar for,
um,
you know,
analyzing old films.

2800
02:29:41.091 --> 02:29:43.040
Right?
And he walked us through it.
He's like,
look,

2801
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:48.090
<v 3>the shadows are parallel.
Right?
They're not diverging.
You know,
a close light</v>

2802
02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:51.830
<v 6>source.
The shadows would,
would diverge.
Right?
Um,
so</v>

2803
02:29:51.930 --> 02:29:53.130
<v 3>wait a minute.
You know that that's like,</v>

2804
02:29:53.131 --> 02:29:57.210
one of the big arguments for the moon hoax is that the shadows intersect.

2805
02:29:57.211 --> 02:30:01.780
The shadows indicate multiple light sources.
Uh,
well that is because,
uh,

2806
02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:06.360
when,
but that's one of the main arguments.
That is a,

2807
02:30:06.361 --> 02:30:09.480
I believe that's reflected light.
Okay.
I'm getting past my memory of the segment,

2808
02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:14.510
but used to be a full on moon hoaxer I fully believed we never went to the,

2809
02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:15.390
I shouldn't have brought this up.

2810
02:30:15.391 --> 02:30:20.391
Watch the documentary that was on Fox TV while I was on news was like 1995 or

2811
02:30:20.581 --> 02:30:23.460
something like that.
I was fucking convince these radios,

2812
02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:26.040
one of my favorite sitcoms ever by the way.

2813
02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:28.780
That is a unacknowledged classic.
Uh,

2814
02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.880
I have watched the whole series like three times.
Um,
that show is so,
I'm sorry,

2815
02:30:32.881 --> 02:30:35.120
just go ahead and set this up.
Anyway.
Um,

2816
02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:40.520
back then Fox News actually aired a full one hour show calling co called

2817
02:30:41.731 --> 02:30:43.950
conspiracy theory.
Did we land on the moon?

2818
02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:48.300
And it had me fully convinced there was all this shit that they showed,

2819
02:30:48.301 --> 02:30:52.770
like the same background being used in multiple moon missions that were supposed

2820
02:30:52.771 --> 02:30:56.010
to be on completely different parts of the moon.
Like how is this possible?

2821
02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:57.900
It's supposed to be like nowhere near each other,

2822
02:30:57.901 --> 02:31:00.650
but they have the same background and that is a,

2823
02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:04.440
it looks like the astronauts are on wires and it looks like the light sources

2824
02:31:04.441 --> 02:31:09.420
are there,
multiple light sources and the shadows are intersecting.
And you know,

2825
02:31:09.421 --> 02:31:13.380
all the fucking astronauts,
when they came back,
they did this,
uh,

2826
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:16.910
Apollo 11 post flight,
a press conference,

2827
02:31:16.911 --> 02:31:20.040
and it looked like they're completely full of shit.
I was all in dude,

2828
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.580
<v 2>all in,
all in and now you're all out.
No,
I realized,</v>

2829
02:31:23.610 --> 02:31:25.950
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.
That's one of the,

2830
02:31:25.951 --> 02:31:29.430
we all need to be a problem with being all in with air,
with anything.

2831
02:31:29.850 --> 02:31:34.590
But we also found that they did fake some things for publicity purposes.

2832
02:31:34.591 --> 02:31:37.360
Photographs that were used that were,
uh,

2833
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:41.940
photographs from tests that they did inside a warehouse with all safety

2834
02:31:41.941 --> 02:31:44.820
equipment and then they blacked out all the safety equipment in the background.

2835
02:31:44.821 --> 02:31:48.270
And s pawn those photos off as spacewalk photos.

2836
02:31:48.510 --> 02:31:52.440
But I think that's overzealous publicists.
It doesn't mean no one went to space.

2837
02:31:52.840 --> 02:31:57.240
It's like making leaps.
Is it public?
Well,
what's the simplest explanation?

2838
02:31:57.241 --> 02:32:01.350
If you did fake some footage,
well,
it's probably a bunch of simple explanations,

2839
02:32:01.351 --> 02:32:03.150
but overzealous publicists,

2840
02:32:03.151 --> 02:32:06.740
people wanted to show people video that they didn't have video of.
Maybe the,

2841
02:32:06.741 --> 02:32:09.330
the photos didn't come out so well,
so they fake some of them.

2842
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:13.550
<v 4>Well,
let me let,
let the,
the thing about the shadows diverging,</v>

2843
02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:15.580
my memory of this is,
we don't talk about that.

2844
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:17.480
When people say they see the shadows diverge,
right?

2845
02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:19.460
If you actually go outside on a sunny day,

2846
02:32:19.461 --> 02:32:22.160
when you have a single point of light like that with light reflecting,

2847
02:32:22.161 --> 02:32:24.200
you will see two shadows of yourself going in different,

2848
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:27.260
there's one dominant shadow and then there's a,
there's a secondary one,
right?

2849
02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:31.670
But if the shadow,
if the sun is actually far away,
right?
For the main shadow,

2850
02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:34.520
you will see the same shadows be parallel,
right?
If you had a close light source,

2851
02:32:34.521 --> 02:32:38.060
like on a film,
on a film set,
you see the shadows diverge,
right?
So at this film,

2852
02:32:38.061 --> 02:32:39.950
Forensic Guy,
come on and tell us,
look,

2853
02:32:40.100 --> 02:32:44.120
if you wanted to get perfectly straight light like that,
you would need lasers.

2854
02:32:44.121 --> 02:32:45.230
You would,
and you would also,

2855
02:32:45.231 --> 02:32:48.530
but you'd also need multicolored lasers because at the time all that existed

2856
02:32:48.531 --> 02:32:50.630
were red lasers.
Right.
They had not existed.

2857
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:53.060
They're not an invented anything other than red lasers.
Right.

2858
02:32:53.300 --> 02:32:56.480
So NASA would have had to have multi,

2859
02:32:56.990 --> 02:33:01.970
multi decade advanced laser light technology in order to fake this.

2860
02:33:02.210 --> 02:33:06.920
Another part of it is that they just hard Kubrick,
he'd figured out,
I mean,
no,

2861
02:33:06.921 --> 02:33:10.130
I mean this is,
this is what we demonstrated in our segment.
You know,

2862
02:33:10.131 --> 02:33:13.460
another part of it is people forget the moon broadcast.

2863
02:33:13.461 --> 02:33:17.030
The moon landing broadcast was something like a six hour live broadcast with no

2864
02:33:17.031 --> 02:33:21.440
cuts,
you know,
and at the time,
that was something you could do with TV,

2865
02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:23.480
but you literally couldn't do it with film.
Right.

2866
02:33:23.481 --> 02:33:25.570
There was no way to record film as,
sorry,

2867
02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:29.120
there's no way to record TV at the time you had live TV and you had recorded

2868
02:33:29.121 --> 02:33:32.630
film.
Right.
So if they were going to record it in advance,
right.

2869
02:33:32.631 --> 02:33:37.100
And then play it back,
they would have needed a six hour long reel of tape.

2870
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:41.780
There's no commercials.
And they're,
uh,
I don't believe so.
Um,
and so,
uh,

2871
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:43.490
they would have had to say,

2872
02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:45.970
so we should probably know if there was commercials cause that's a fair point.

2873
02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:47.061
But you know,

2874
02:33:47.061 --> 02:33:50.700
you would have needed like an enormous film canister that also didn't exist.

2875
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:52.910
It was going to have an enormous film canister.

2876
02:33:52.911 --> 02:33:55.930
It'd be those fucking hoaxers at NASA.
Well done.

2877
02:33:56.330 --> 02:34:00.290
And well part of the premise of the,
part of the premise of the,

2878
02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:03.530
we didn't go to the moon argument is that we didn't have the technology to go to

2879
02:34:03.531 --> 02:34:05.600
the moon.
So they fixed it.
Right,
right.
But it's like,
okay,

2880
02:34:05.601 --> 02:34:08.610
well if you have to postulate that they had decades ahead of its time filmmaking

2881
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:11.870
technology,
why can't you accept that they just went to the fucking moon,

2882
02:34:11.871 --> 02:34:12.281
you know?
So the,

2883
02:34:12.281 --> 02:34:15.710
at the end when you go through all the things that would have to happen,
right,

2884
02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:17.980
in order to make it,
have you really go through it and look at what

2885
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:19.060
<v 5>is the simplest explanation.</v>

2886
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:21.280
The simplest explanation is that we went to the moon because it would have been

2887
02:34:21.281 --> 02:34:24.250
fucking easier.
I don't know if it would have been easier.

2888
02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:28.360
If it was impossible to go to the moon,
it would be insanely difficult to fake,

2889
02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:29.283
no doubt.

2890
02:34:29.470 --> 02:34:34.470
But if you had an incredible budget and if you had someone who really had the

2891
02:34:36.161 --> 02:34:40.270
very top of the food chain knowledge in terms of special effects,

2892
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:45.610
what Kubrick did in 2001 one one was,
when was that?

2893
02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:49.960
When did 2001 come out and want to sell at 71 or some shit like that?

2894
02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:54.130
When does that come out?
Uh,
see,
yeah,
look it up.
I think it was earlier than that.

2895
02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:56.740
Maybe 68 68 okay,

2896
02:34:56.741 --> 02:34:59.650
so we're talking about before the moon landings,

2897
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.840
Cooper cats and pretty astonishing special effects in 2001 yeah,

2898
02:35:04.841 --> 02:35:08.740
but the,
the,
I mean,
the argument is that like even given,
again,

2899
02:35:08.741 --> 02:35:12.520
this is like film maker sang this,
given the film technology of the time,

2900
02:35:12.521 --> 02:35:16.780
the specific features that we see in the moon footage are not favorable.

2901
02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:19.840
You know,
another part of it is,
for instance,
the slow jumping,
right?

2902
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:22.990
The slow boom,
boom.
You know,
you're on the moon,
right?

2903
02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:27.250
The big argument that the moon true Thurs make is that it was regular speed

2904
02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:30.670
footage and it was slowed down.
Right,
right.
And there's this dude on,

2905
02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:32.190
I can't read the name of it.
Um,

2906
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:34.390
but if you search or is there a filmmaker on youtube,
right.

2907
02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:35.320
And he just breaks down.

2908
02:35:35.321 --> 02:35:40.000
Why like the ability to overcrank and like shooting slow mo like that.

2909
02:35:40.001 --> 02:35:44.380
Like didn't,
that wasn't how film cameras worked at the time,
you know.
Um,
uh,

2910
02:35:44.381 --> 02:35:48.110
and so couldn't air things in slow mo back then.
Um,

2911
02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:50.260
look you're good at,

2912
02:35:50.261 --> 02:35:52.450
you're good at asking questions cause you asked me to get into details that I

2913
02:35:52.451 --> 02:35:55.680
don't have a up top of my head,
but that's the,
that's the argument that,

2914
02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:57.120
that the dude makes.
Um,

2915
02:35:57.140 --> 02:35:59.230
it's not one of the arguments that we make specifically on our show because we

2916
02:35:59.231 --> 02:36:00.840
only had six minutes,
so we did the best ones.

2917
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:04.150
It's always an interesting argument when you're talking about the moon landing.

2918
02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:07.360
I also know about how much your audience do you think is going to be fucking

2919
02:36:07.361 --> 02:36:09.730
furious at me for talking about this because they believe the moon landing was

2920
02:36:09.731 --> 02:36:13.960
faked.
It like 15% I was exactly going to be my guest.

2921
02:36:13.961 --> 02:36:15.640
It's always a number,
man.
There's a number of years.

2922
02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:17.440
I think that vaccines cause autism.

2923
02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:23.300
Dr Peter Hotez on here who is an expert in tropical diseases and autism safety

2924
02:36:24.281 --> 02:36:28.210
and he's explaining that they've isolated five environmental factors that

2925
02:36:28.390 --> 02:36:32.920
contribute to autism.
When it's in the child's womb,
they've isolated genes.

2926
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:36.670
They think they've got an understanding of what's causing this or how it's how

2927
02:36:36.671 --> 02:36:38.680
it,
at least it's happening,
but it's happening in the womb.

2928
02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:43.330
They don't think there's any connection to vaccines and autism.

2929
02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.650
They think there's people who have autism who get vaccinated in their autism

2930
02:36:47.651 --> 02:36:51.550
symptoms show up,
but they were probably going to have those symptoms anyway.

2931
02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:53.560
And there's a human correlation that they make.

2932
02:36:53.890 --> 02:36:57.160
It doesn't mean that some people don't get adversely affected by vaccines

2933
02:36:57.161 --> 02:36:59.890
because people have very strange reactions to all sorts of things.

2934
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:01.540
Cause we very biologically,

2935
02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:04.720
it doesn't mean that vaccines are giving people autism.

2936
02:37:04.721 --> 02:37:07.450
And when you say that people go fucking ballistic,

2937
02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:11.650
the comments fill with hate and Zionist shill and this and that.

2938
02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.010
It's wild.
I get that shit a lot.
But,
but what we're doing here,
you and I

2939
02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:17.810
<v 4>are,
even if we disagree,</v>

2940
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:20.510
this is what I think is one of the most important things of our time,

2941
02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:23.360
is the ability to have reasonable conversations.
I agree.

2942
02:37:23.690 --> 02:37:27.740
And I try to tell people,
um,
when they disagree with me,

2943
02:37:27.741 --> 02:37:29.810
because when people come in and meet with a lot of heat on the Internet,

2944
02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:32.120
you know,
a lot of times I don't have time to get into it,
you know,

2945
02:37:32.121 --> 02:37:37.070
but I do like to occasionally,
you know,
reply and say,
you know,
someone like,
Oh,

2946
02:37:37.071 --> 02:37:39.830
you're so full of shit.
Like you lied about this and that,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

2947
02:37:39.831 --> 02:37:43.010
blah.
You know,
and I tried to get new essay say,
and I,
and I say,
hey,

2948
02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:46.370
thanks for watching the show.
You know,
um,
I don't feel that we lied.

2949
02:37:46.371 --> 02:37:48.620
This is where evidence says,
you know,
what,
what do you think?
You know?

2950
02:37:48.621 --> 02:37:50.060
And I try to take their temperature down,
you know,

2951
02:37:50.061 --> 02:37:53.000
and I don't match their anger is the most important part.

2952
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:55.790
I'm like much nicer than their anger demands,
you know?

2953
02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:00.470
And that usually cools them off right away.
And then we have a conversation,

2954
02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:05.270
you know,
and a lot of the time when I do that,
uh,
they leave going,

2955
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:09.650
okay,
you know what,
we,
we don't disagree that much,
you know,
or,
or okay,

2956
02:38:09.651 --> 02:38:11.380
thanks for talking to me,
you know.
Um,

2957
02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:14.730
but the most important thing I say to them is,
uh,

2958
02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:19.550
even if I don't turn them around on whatever the issue was,
um,
I say okay.

2959
02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:22.250
They say I'm never going to watch your show again cause you lied about this,

2960
02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:24.110
you know,
cause I disagree with it but you're wrong about this.

2961
02:38:24.111 --> 02:38:26.210
I'm never watching Shogun.
And I say,
okay,

2962
02:38:26.211 --> 02:38:27.860
why would you never watch the show again?

2963
02:38:27.861 --> 02:38:30.350
Just because you disagree with me about one thing.

2964
02:38:30.410 --> 02:38:34.250
Like I watched tons of stuff with people I don't disagree,
you know,

2965
02:38:34.310 --> 02:38:38.880
like don't really mean that.
They just want you to feel bad.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,

2966
02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:42.940
yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.
Followed five,

2967
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:45.710
never watching you again followed like,

2968
02:38:45.711 --> 02:38:50.630
does anybody think it's a good idea to only consume shit that you already agree

2969
02:38:50.631 --> 02:38:54.140
with?
I think it's better to challenge yourself and to watch things that you,

2970
02:38:54.170 --> 02:38:55.670
that you don't agree with all the time.

2971
02:38:55.671 --> 02:38:58.010
You Watch Fox News at least one hour every week.

2972
02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:02.210
Do you really watch it an hour and just go,
what the fuck?

2973
02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:07.210
But it's happening.
Yeah.
I mean there's a lot of,
you know,

2974
02:39:07.211 --> 02:39:10.220
they're like,
I want to know what white people really up to.

2975
02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:15.290
They're scared all the time when they're around me.
They lie.
I need to know.

2976
02:39:16.390 --> 02:39:18.530
I'll have to be,
I would have to get high with Laura Ingram,

2977
02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:22.700
see how she's getting in trouble for laughing at Nipsey a hustles funeral.

2978
02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:26.870
That was very bizarre.
Strange.
It's very strange to be,

2979
02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:31.850
they're laughing to be so dialed in to that.
Look,

2980
02:39:31.851 --> 02:39:34.370
I understand when you're in,
when you're one of those hosts,
right?

2981
02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.830
You have a message,
you're dialed into it.

2982
02:39:36.831 --> 02:39:39.980
You got to say that message every single day.
Every single time you're like,

2983
02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:45.110
you're a monomaniacal about it.
You know what I mean?
But to do that about,

2984
02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.770
about someone's death specifically bizarre,
you know?

2985
02:39:48.771 --> 02:39:52.520
And that sort of gives you sometimes I think that TV shows or like a curse,

2986
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:55.880
you know,
um,
like I feel for anybody who has to be on TV every day,

2987
02:39:56.450 --> 02:40:00.470
their life narrows down to that Little Camera Lens and they can't have a thought

2988
02:40:00.471 --> 02:40:03.500
outside of it.
You know what I mean?
So all those paper,
Tucker,
Tucker,

2989
02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:06.530
Tucker Carlson,
Rachel Maddow,
Laura Ingram,
you know what I mean?

2990
02:40:06.531 --> 02:40:11.180
Like they like chambers.
Yeah.
Apart from me disagreeing with,
you know,

2991
02:40:11.181 --> 02:40:14.100
some of them on various things.
I disagree with all folks on occasion.

2992
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:19.230
<v 6>Um,
like to live your life right in that Lens,
saying the same thing every night.</v>

2993
02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:21.490
It must really impoverish your point of view in a,

2994
02:40:21.491 --> 02:40:24.590
in a way that's really a bummer.
And me seeing her do that,
it's like,
yeah,

2995
02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:26.780
<v 3>that's a great perspective.
Impoverished in your point of view.</v>

2996
02:40:26.781 --> 02:40:27.614
I think you're onto that.

2997
02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:30.750
<v 6>Well,
thank you.
I,
I mean,
that's when I saw,
when I saw that clip of her,</v>

2998
02:40:30.751 --> 02:40:34.550
I was like,
I can't,
I can't believe you know,
but it,
it,
it,

2999
02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:37.200
it's t being on TV makes you crazy person

3000
02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:41.620
<v 3>probably does man with them.
With Laura Ingram.
It was also,</v>

3001
02:40:41.621 --> 02:40:45.840
they had just played a clip of one of Nipsey hussle is videos for one of his

3002
02:40:45.841 --> 02:40:48.170
songs that was called Fuck Donald Trump.
Yeah.

3003
02:40:48.310 --> 02:40:50.920
And they were mocking the song and laughing and I'm like,
look,

3004
02:40:50.921 --> 02:40:53.560
it's not about the guys aren't the guy's dead.

3005
02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:57.610
He was murdered in Los Angeles and obviously you look at all the hundreds of

3006
02:40:57.610 --> 02:41:01.130
thousands of people that are mourning him in the streets.
They loved him.
Yeah.

3007
02:41:01.150 --> 02:41:02.890
Why did they love him?
Maybe look at that.

3008
02:41:02.891 --> 02:41:04.600
Maybe because he was giving back to the community.

3009
02:41:04.601 --> 02:41:07.630
Maybe it's because the guy became successful and still wanted to be in the

3010
02:41:07.631 --> 02:41:11.590
community and help people out because he was a positive influence on a lot of

3011
02:41:11.591 --> 02:41:14.860
young people.
Yeah.
So he had a song called Fuck Donald Trump,
whatever.

3012
02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:19.570
And then we're,
and you know,
the worst thing I think,
what's that on that song?

3013
02:41:19.571 --> 02:41:24.571
But it's not his why g what is the one ice cubes got a dope song about the

3014
02:41:25.781 --> 02:41:29.170
president.
He might,
it might be like,
kill the arrest,
the president.

3015
02:41:29.410 --> 02:41:32.320
It might be called the rest of the president.
Pretty fucking good.
You know,
the,

3016
02:41:32.490 --> 02:41:35.770
the,
the worst thing that I think is his new ice cubes,
new shit.

3017
02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:41.990
<v 6>Uh,
the,
the,
the worst thing I think that people say is like,
um,</v>

3018
02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:44.960
uh,
the,
the perspective that she had was okay,

3019
02:41:44.961 --> 02:41:47.850
because he doesn't like Donald Trump.
He's not worthy of respect right here.

3020
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:48.291
I'm not,

3021
02:41:48.291 --> 02:41:50.870
I'm not going to be sad he's dead because he said something mean about Donald

3022
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:51.450
Trump.
Right?

3023
02:41:51.450 --> 02:41:55.820
Dad is such a malignant version of the way that so many people feel like the

3024
02:41:55.821 --> 02:42:00.180
most frustrating thing people say to me is,
um,
you know,
on,

3025
02:42:00.181 --> 02:42:03.050
on our comp,
no comments page on youtube page.
This guy's a liberal.

3026
02:42:03.051 --> 02:42:05.480
This guy's a Democrat,
so I'm not going to listen to them.
I'm like,
okay,
well,

3027
02:42:05.481 --> 02:42:06.314
first of all,

3028
02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:10.850
we criticize Democrats and liberals all the time on the show.
You know,

3029
02:42:10.851 --> 02:42:13.550
so those people are like dual responsibility.
They're like,
does it Adam?

3030
02:42:13.551 --> 02:42:17.210
Conover realize he's criticizing a Democrat priority.
And I'm like,
yeah,

3031
02:42:17.290 --> 02:42:21.890
I all the time,
you know,
like we,
uh,
are,
we do not do a political show.
You know,

3032
02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:24.410
look,
I live in Los Angeles,
right?
I went to college.

3033
02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:26.820
I didn't vote for Donald Trump.
You know what I mean?
Um,
uh,

3034
02:42:26.821 --> 02:42:29.130
like most people who didn't.
All right,
so I'm going to,

3035
02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:30.380
I'm going to fess up to that.
Right.

3036
02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:35.240
Why does that mean that you would never listen to anything I ever had to say or

3037
02:42:35.241 --> 02:42:38.480
that you would treat me with disrespect,
right.
Trying to make you feel bad,
bro.

3038
02:42:38.530 --> 02:42:43.110
Yeah.
Talking about it right now.
So they win.
Uh,
all fair enough.
Fair enough.
Yeah.

3039
02:42:43.130 --> 02:42:45.140
Okay.
We can move off of it,
but you know,
that I,

3040
02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.370
that idea of someone who disagrees with me is like not a person who I'm going to

3041
02:42:49.371 --> 02:42:52.760
listen to anymore.
What a,
what a bummer.
Yeah.
It wasn't the people from all,

3042
02:42:52.761 --> 02:42:55.010
all perspectives and backgrounds.
That's my goal.

3043
02:42:55.170 --> 02:42:57.480
<v 3>Even more insidious.
What they're doing is they're trying to say,</v>

3044
02:42:57.481 --> 02:43:02.481
this whole life that was just lost is this one clip that says fuck the fuck

3045
02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:04.530
Donald Trump.
That's so stupid.

3046
02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:07.320
He's obviously a lot of things like that's quote mining.

3047
02:43:07.321 --> 02:43:11.650
You're taking a little tiny piece of some things that he did out of context and

3048
02:43:11.651 --> 02:43:14.230
you putting it on your show and then you're mocking his death.

3049
02:43:14.730 --> 02:43:18.970
And it's unfortunate.
But again,
I think it's these echo chambers.
He's,

3050
02:43:18.971 --> 02:43:20.470
people think it's okay to do that.

3051
02:43:20.890 --> 02:43:23.200
They know that the other people that are like them,

3052
02:43:23.201 --> 02:43:24.280
we're going to react the same way.

3053
02:43:24.281 --> 02:43:29.140
Like what the guy had a song called Fuck Donald Trump.
I mean,
hey fuck,
kill her.

3054
02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:30.310
And then they just get,

3055
02:43:30.311 --> 02:43:33.010
they all just repeat that and they think that's like the people that were

3056
02:43:33.011 --> 02:43:34.390
shocked that Trump won.

3057
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:37.420
They couldn't believe anybody would vote for Trump because everybody around you

3058
02:43:37.421 --> 02:43:40.420
would not see it.
You get stuck in these echo chambers.

3059
02:43:40.421 --> 02:43:42.250
You don't understand how other people outside see it.

3060
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:45.040
And I think that's what's happening.
You know,
with this,

3061
02:43:45.041 --> 02:43:48.820
it's just a hundred percent sad.
It's a guy's fucking dead guy was murdered.

3062
02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:52.630
<v 6>Yeah,
we did a,
um,
you know,
we did a segment on,
on guns,
right?</v>

3063
02:43:52.631 --> 02:43:53.470
We didn't episode on guns.

3064
02:43:53.471 --> 02:43:55.510
And I always thought that I said at the beginning of our show,

3065
02:43:55.511 --> 02:43:57.730
we'd never do an episode on guns because it's too divisive.

3066
02:43:57.731 --> 02:44:00.250
And as soon as we did the topic,
people,
everyone had fold their arms.

3067
02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:01.840
And these are,
you can do an episode on guns.
Well,

3068
02:44:01.841 --> 02:44:05.840
you better say what I want you to say,
or I'm changing the channel.
Right?
And we,

3069
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:08.140
uh,
but we been doing the show for four years.
I was like,

3070
02:44:08.141 --> 02:44:11.620
I think we can finally do it.
And here's the thing,
everybody is wrong about guns.

3071
02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:14.320
That's the premise of our show.
Everyone's wrong about everything.
You know,

3072
02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:16.960
if you think you know about something,
you probably don't,
and anything,

3073
02:44:16.961 --> 02:44:19.250
any topic that I do,
I'm going to tell you something you don't know.
Right.

3074
02:44:19.340 --> 02:44:23.970
And so we specifically did an episode that's about,
you know,
we,
we had a,

3075
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.010
you know,
a gun gun rights advocate at gun control advocate.

3076
02:44:27.011 --> 02:44:31.450
I'm talking to both of them.
And they're both making mistakes,
right.
Um,
about it.

3077
02:44:31.900 --> 02:44:35.530
Um,
and,
uh,
that was the point.
Was that like,

3078
02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:38.410
the thing that liberals not,
I don't want to say liberals,

3079
02:44:38.411 --> 02:44:40.180
the thing that gun control advocates,

3080
02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.800
right often fail to do is they failed to take seriously that the gun rights

3081
02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:49.860
advocates are like real people who live in the same country as them,

3082
02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:54.310
who they need to deal with as humans.
Right?

3083
02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:57.790
Like the NRA is,
has a lot of,

3084
02:44:58.180 --> 02:45:00.280
I'm not going to defend the NRA for a second.
Right?

3085
02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:04.060
I think the NRA is a very extreme organization that is not productive,
you know.

3086
02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:09.190
Um,
but like the average gun con,
the average gun owner in your community,
right,

3087
02:45:09.191 --> 02:45:10.630
is a real person you have to deal with.
Right?

3088
02:45:10.631 --> 02:45:12.680
And if you're just in your echo chamber and you're not taking that person

3089
02:45:12.681 --> 02:45:16.600
seriously,
then you're not gonna make any progress.
Right.
Um,
and so you need to,

3090
02:45:16.601 --> 02:45:20.230
you know,
uh,
gun control advocates are,
and just as much need of correction,

3091
02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:24.040
you know,
and just as much need of,
of checking themselves and,
you know,

3092
02:45:24.041 --> 02:45:28.480
examining their own biases and,
you know,
getting closer to the truth as,
uh,

3093
02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:30.550
uh,
as gun rights advocates.
Yeah.

3094
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:34.590
<v 3>Particularly if you want to ever resolve it or come to any sort of an agreement,</v>

3095
02:45:34.650 --> 02:45:36.480
you can't treat the other people like they're stupid.

3096
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:40.260
Like you fucking morons don't get it.
Okay,
well that's not helping anybody.

3097
02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:43.800
And that the issue with people that also get angry at people who voted for
Trump,

3098
02:45:44.130 --> 02:45:45.930
they want to say they're all stupid.
Okay.
You want to say that?

3099
02:45:45.931 --> 02:45:49.670
Half the country stupid.
That's not a good idea.
That's not smart.
Yeah.

3100
02:45:49.740 --> 02:45:50.640
I want to say the reason

3101
02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:52.680
<v 6>I said I,
I went to college,
I didn't vote for Donald Trump.</v>

3102
02:45:52.681 --> 02:45:55.310
Not because a lot of college,
a lot of people went to college,

3103
02:45:55.320 --> 02:45:57.360
did vote for Donald Trump.
The trend is that they is,

3104
02:45:57.361 --> 02:45:58.380
that they didn't vote for him,
you know,

3105
02:45:58.381 --> 02:46:00.150
so I was trying to say I'm in a different demographic,

3106
02:46:00.151 --> 02:46:04.380
but I don't want people to think of what I was replying.
I believe so.
Yeah.
Um,

3107
02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:06.850
it's,
I mean that's sort of how it breaks down.
Like people,
you know,

3108
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:10.280
people with bas or higher tend to,
tend to vote for.
So I'm just like giving

3109
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.040
<v 4>a nod to the demographics here.
This is how it breaks down.
Right.
Um,</v>

3110
02:46:13.090 --> 02:46:16.530
I've got to wrap this up as a man.
It was a lot of fun.
Absolutely o'clock.

3111
02:46:16.580 --> 02:46:20.000
Can you believe it?
Holy Shit.
Three oh five for a while.
Thank you.
Uh,
Oh,
