1
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Mike Baker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you sir?</v>

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I am too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very well thank you.</v>

4
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Very happy to be coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see Ya.</v>

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.533
<v Speaker 1>This world's in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to talk to a rational man like </v>

7
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:21.371
<v Speaker 1>yourself who's got the inside scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never been built that way before,</v>

8
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bonus in this irrational world.</v>

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Your rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

10
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're deemed a rational man.</v>

11
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been lowering the bar,</v>

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.733
<v Speaker 1>lowering our expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking before the show started </v>

13
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>about the current cover of the economist</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has Donald Trump dressed up like,</v>

14
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>because Uncle Sam and it just says </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

15
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's what you want to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody who has jumped that chasm.</v>

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a stand that everybody's upset.</v>

18
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>People are angry people if for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>their motivation,</v>

19
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:54.014
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

20
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get Jones got up,</v>

21
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>look at that fucking cover.</v>

22
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're down to.</v>

23
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>That's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do you get to,</v>

24
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>how do you get from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

25
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>he's entertaining and I understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to be entertained.</v>

26
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:10.044
<v Speaker 1>To some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you get to the point from </v>

27
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>saying it's entertaining to leader of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the free world?</v>

28
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.603
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand when I talk to people who </v>

29
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

30
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely supporting him.</v>

31
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you as a man who's been deep in the </v>

32
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 2>world of security or CIA operative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

33
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.653
<v Speaker 2>you've got the inside scoop would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this machine runs to a certain </v>

34
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:31.274
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that at this point it's </v>

35
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:34.814
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so complicated that almost no one </v>

36
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>wants to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

37
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.553
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a job that like people are </v>

38
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 2>scrambling to get any more,</v>

39
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in their right mind would want to</v>

40
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>put themselves through it or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>unless you're independently wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

43
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just don't care.</v>

44
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

45
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

46
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.033
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about the kid who wants to </v>

47
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>become president of the young </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans club right in,</v>

48
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in middle school,</v>

49
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.053
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>all through his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all he wants.</v>

51
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be an elected official </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

52
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.314
<v Speaker 1>So he goes maybe to the town council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then eventually in his big goal was to </v>

53
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>become a congressman and God forbid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he gets that and he goes on,</v>

54
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain personality type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

55
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>that's way up its own ass that allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to think that.</v>

56
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sh I should be president of the </v>

57
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look in the mirror every morning and I</v>

58
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:23.581
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

59
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I should lead the free world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right there,</v>

60
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I think you've got a flaw in all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are pursuing elected office,</v>

61
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>but then you've got the money that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

62
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>You've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be independently wealthy.</v>

63
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to disappear down a rabbit hole,</v>

64
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I lived on the east coast before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved out to Idaho,</v>

66
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>which is a great state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

67
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

68
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.791
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:43.291
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

70
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

71
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And if we probably shouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything</v>

72
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 2>orphans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's flat or something.</v>

73
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:49.960
<v Speaker 2>If I had this conversation with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>two guys,</v>

74
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

75
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>About it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

76
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly farms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what it is.</v>

78
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of agriculture,</v>

79
00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has more,</v>

80
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

81
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting fact about Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can write this down.</v>

82
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.723
<v Speaker 1>If you took an iron and iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho flat and then you did that with </v>

83
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.134
<v Speaker 1>all the other states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way the state that would be </v>

84
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>bigger would be Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same for river frontage,</v>

85
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.210
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The river miles of rafting is,</v>

86
00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>is insane out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

87
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.150
<v Speaker 1>but the point being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it,</v>

88
00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:20.240
<v Speaker 1>before we moved out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the east coast and um,</v>

89
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>my wife is involved in politics to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

90
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but we spent some time in Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right watching,</v>

91
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

92
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the governor race there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>and they would have to go from town </v>
<v Speaker 1>council,</v>

94
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>the town council,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it workspace that way.</v>

95
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.053
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get the vote of the </v>

96
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party of the Democratic Party</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the town council.</v>

97
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And the first question any of them would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever ask was,</v>

98
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>can you self fund?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

99
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money do you have?</v>

100
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.243
<v Speaker 1>And so you put that together with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that nobody wants to open their </v>

101
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>family up to the ridiculous scrutiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's involved and you,</v>

102
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.103
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

103
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>We get what we get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get this,</v>

104
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>this crazed campaign season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.434
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we're down the assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only people who want to be it and </v>

106
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of an old Kook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's an asshole.</v>

108
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got all these asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a nice guy actually with a</v>

109
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.380
<v Speaker 1>lot of good ideas socially and I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

110
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

111
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the biggest example in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of picking the lesser evil.</v>

112
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>That's how I'm looking at this campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

113
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:24.244
<v Speaker 1>what's the lesser evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be Hillary Clinton who </v>

114
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>basically I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

115
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.153
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel any sincerity from her at </v>

116
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>

117
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.293
<v Speaker 1>She's been in the business for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's been involved in politics for so </v>

118
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she knows how to be just</v>

119
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

120
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

121
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>my problem with Hillary is it's purely </v>
<v Speaker 1>an operational one.</v>

122
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I know that if I had handled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even in a conservative way,</v>

123
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:50.644
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what she did with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>email server and her colleagues or </v>

124
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>cohorts did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.271
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

126
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:55.811
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

127
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>it and conservative way I'm looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>at how bad it was.</v>

129
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>If I had done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been sent to prison.</v>

130
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.220
<v Speaker 1>And I know because we had various </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter intelligence operations and else</v>

131
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>or you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to find the lake,</v>

132
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to find the problem.</v>

133
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.953
<v Speaker 1>you watch people get banged up for less </v>
<v Speaker 1>egregious acts then what she's been </v>

135
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:18.980
<v Speaker 1>involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my problem with Hillary is looking,</v>

136
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you one set of rules for everybody,</v>

137
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

138
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>David Petraeus is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hands over some,</v>

139
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information to his mistress who had a</v>

140
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>security clearance and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets a couple of years probation,</v>

141
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large fine has to plead guilty.</v>

142
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she literally handed it over to the </v>

143
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians and any other state and non</v>

144
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>state sponsored a hacker out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain which again,</v>

145
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>for people who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she for whatever her motivations,</v>

146
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:48.234
<v Speaker 1>she initially said it was simply a </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of ease after saying that she </v>

147
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>didn't really know because it wasn't her</v>
<v Speaker 1>gig.</v>

148
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>She set up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.533
<v Speaker 1>a private email server in her bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bathroom in her bathroom at her </v>

150
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>house in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a server in their bathroom.</v>

151
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I know that seems like a weird choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're multitasking.</v>

153
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't have that much time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

154
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And she's constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did not use that excuse as I recall.</v>

155
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It still doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

156
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.313
<v Speaker 1>I know they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have no extra rooms in the </v>

157
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Clinton House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a small place.</v>

158
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>You made about $190 million over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years.</v>

159
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So we're supposed to believe she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in a one bedroom,</v>

160
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>one bath place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>800 square feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she,</v>

162
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.353
<v Speaker 1>she used this and essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is she traffic was directed </v>

163
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.190
<v Speaker 1>through this unprotected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 1>server that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and she's arguing semantics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's saying,</v>

166
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:44.054
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that it was classified and </v>

167
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.143
<v Speaker 1>yet it's either classified or it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it at when and when you </v>

168
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.254
<v Speaker 1>sign on to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a senior official at her </v>

169
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:54.164
<v Speaker 1>level or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some milk that's walking around just </v>

170
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>carrying papers at the agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>

171
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.723
<v Speaker 1>you sign agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that you will protect classified </v>

172
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

173
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't say it has to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified.</v>

174
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.743
<v Speaker 1>It says that you are aware because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through a briefing about what is and </v>

175
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:11.594
<v Speaker 1>what is and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how you look at a piece of </v>

176
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.664
<v Speaker 1>information to determine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's saying it wasn't classified </v>

177
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>when she saw it or when it hit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>server,</v>

178
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.473
<v Speaker 1>but what they were doing is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting and pasting from classified </v>

179
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 1>documents so that they could bypass </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic and what their motivation was.</v>

180
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea whether they thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was quicker,</v>

181
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>whether it was easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't read a lot of nefarious intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read,</v>

183
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an egregious mishandling of classified </v>

184
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>information that anybody else would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished for.</v>

185
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:40.814
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the bureau is engaged in a </v>

187
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:43.574
<v Speaker 1>couple of different investigations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have all the information </v>

188
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 1>they would need to put the ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

189
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>or move for an indictment.</v>

191
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think the DOJ is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

192
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>So what is their motivation to ignore </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

193
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

194
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's political top cover because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>

195
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 1>there's only one other person running </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Democratic Party.</v>

196
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people aren't too excited about</v>

197
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 1>having Bernie Sanders become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

198
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

199
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

200
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.051
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

202
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:09.884
<v Speaker 1>the left makes fun of the Republicans as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should because look what we've got </v>

203
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>is our front runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

204
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>they make fun of the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans were all upset because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're anointed one,</v>

207
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:21.180
<v Speaker 1>whether it's rubio or whomever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

208
00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 1>is in the dust right now it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way on the other side.</v>

209
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

210
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people,</v>

211
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our knickers in a twist on the,</v>

212
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:28.064
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left upset that perhaps they are </v>

213
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:31.184
<v Speaker 1>anointed one isn't going to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If if whom Abbott in or one of her </v>

214
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>cohorts who was involved in this who </v>
<v Speaker 1>also were being looked at in a very,</v>

215
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>very serious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one of them gets banged up for this,</v>

216
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know how it doesn't spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>to her.</v>

217
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 1>She was in charge and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that shit rolls downhill.</v>

218
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.643
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that seems like the only way it </v>

219
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't is the whole thing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about her in the first place,</v>

220
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>that she's just so deeply entrenched</v>

221
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v Speaker 3>in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so political and she's washed so </v>

222
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 3>many hands and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

223
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.973
<v Speaker 3>they're all tied in together and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fabric that sort of keeping her </v>

224
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 3>afloat right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her whole sort of,</v>

225
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political operating mechanism.</v>

226
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.313
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's just so deeply entwined in the </v>

227
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Washington system and that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's keeping her from,</v>

228
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.153
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this was going on and if somehow or </v>

229
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 3>another this was someone like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who is an outsider,</v>

230
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would chase him down.</v>

231
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about it.</v>

232
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

233
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:30.680
<v Speaker 3>this is a remarkable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

234
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from it and I get it not taken away.</v>

235
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 3>She's got a lot of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

236
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

237
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

238
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the guy.</v>

239
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

240
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of good things about him.</v>

241
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

242
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty,</v>

243
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how else to put it.</v>

244
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 3>We've got trump on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got,</v>

245
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>we've got hillary under investigation on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side.</v>

246
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:54.654
<v Speaker 3>We've got Bernie Sanders and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand why people like Bernie </v>

247
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.210
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

248
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 3>who wouldn't you like free stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free stuff is,</v>

249
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I'd give me some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

250
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 3>I've got three little boys I've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put through college.</v>

251
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people feel like there's an imbalance</v>

252
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 3>and they feel like this is the only guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's saying,</v>

253
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's imbalanced.</v>

254
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.633
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that understand economics or </v>

255
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 3>apparently upset at him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand economics.</v>

256
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky I don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people that,</v>

257
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.574
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was a fucking accountant and shoot </v>

258
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jump off a bridge.</v>

259
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that understand that are like</v>

260
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 3>this guy's policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not going to work.</v>

261
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Like none of this is gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an argument for other people.</v>

262
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 3>But the people that feel like we got </v>
<v Speaker 3>screwed in 2008 with the,</v>

263
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.301
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

264
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole bailout and the,</v>

265
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 3>the banks and all the craziness with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic collapse,</v>

266
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 3>they feel like at least some guys coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>

267
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 3>this is addressing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's the only one.</v>

268
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 3>So that's what people are gravitating </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards.</v>

269
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.213
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of social stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>his gravitating towards the black lives </v>

270
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:51.144
<v Speaker 3>matter movement and wanting to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana legal and all that </v>

271
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:54.864
<v Speaker 3>stuff that I understand too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it does not one person that stands </v>

272
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 3>out where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's my guy,</v>

273
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.470
<v Speaker 3>there's my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

274
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

275
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.901
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

276
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could take Bernie,</v>

277
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:05.724
<v Speaker 3>cause I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things people like </v>

278
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 3>about Sanders's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been consistent over the years.</v>

279
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.541
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

280
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 3>So he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not changing.</v>

281
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

282
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.883
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is something to be said here or </v>

283
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:16.254
<v Speaker 3>this political system where apparently </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to evolve your </v>

284
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:19.584
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

285
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flip flopper yeah.</v>

286
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:21.891
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

287
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:22.724
<v Speaker 3>Well you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it's so that part of it or you can't </v>

288
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 3>negotiate a compromise as if somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weakness.</v>

289
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Negotiating and compromising is how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get shit done,</v>

290
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 3>whether it's in government or business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

291
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to stamp people like sanders.</v>

292
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 3>They like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

293
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his consistency.</v>

294
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the social side of it.</v>

295
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes good sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

296
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like you,</v>

297
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:42.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spent most of my life overseas,</v>

299
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.553
<v Speaker 3>some of them in some pretty crappy </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries where socialism has been </v>

300
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.124
<v Speaker 3>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I understand he's a democratic </v>

301
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 3>socialist and so it's a kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentler form.</v>

302
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've</v>

303
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>seen some pretty harsh results from </v>
<v Speaker 1>those systems overseas.</v>

304
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

305
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that there,</v>

306
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I understand young people jumping on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that train.</v>

307
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just surprised that the,</v>

308
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other folks who are on board,</v>

309
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people up in Wall </v>

310
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Street that are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

311
00:12:14.241 --> 00:12:15.074
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie is going to tax the shit out of </v>

312
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:17.780
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

313
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said as much so I don't know how much</v>

314
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>he's going to tax people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to pay attention to how the,</v>

315
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:25.264
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially what he wants to do is </v>

316
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>anyone who makes more than a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

317
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 1>he wants to impose a very large tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>above that certain amount.</v>

318
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil figured out whatever that number </v>

319
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's $10 million a year,</v>

320
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything over that,</v>

321
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to attack the fuck out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

322
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for everything he needs.</v>

323
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 1>He needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he that tax is going to roll down to the</v>

324
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:46.114
<v Speaker 1>middle class and the lower middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the elephant in the </v>

325
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.534
<v Speaker 1>room that nobody wants to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hilary's ben talking about it a </v>

326
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.770
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's been bringing this up but,</v>

327
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.823
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans have been talking about </v>

328
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:57.424
<v Speaker 1>it cause I don't think they view him as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as anybody that they're going to be </v>

329
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 1>facing in the general election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

330
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:02.104
<v Speaker 1>taxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxing that 1% the 2% to 3% whatever it </v>

331
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:05.584
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.723
<v Speaker 1>you could raise those taxes up to 99% </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pay for free </v>

333
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and education for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

334
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's always complaining about the</v>

335
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much government.</v>

336
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>The government's intruding in our lives.</v>

337
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.523
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this government is that when you charge </v>

338
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>more taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take more taxes.</v>

339
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You creating more government.</v>

340
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:24.723
<v Speaker 1>That's just what you're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money's not going to go or directly </v>

341
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:28.324
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a check in the </v>

342
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:30.064
<v Speaker 1>mail folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go to the government and </v>

343
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:35.650
<v Speaker 1>then the same incompetent fucks that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>handling the irs and all the other shit.</v>

344
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be handling this money.</v>

345
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you think they're going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to create more jobs.</v>

346
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for less.</v>

347
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna make more money and work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get less shit done,</v>

348
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be more catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

349
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a cluster fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many goddamn people is too.</v>

350
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when 2008 hit,</v>

351
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:53.914
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the economy really went in the </v>

352
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Shitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 1>growth in terms of employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:13:57.821 --> 00:13:58.490
<v Speaker 1>where it happened.</v>

355
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.323
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of this country was in Washington </v>

356
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:00.814
<v Speaker 1>DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

357
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.973
<v Speaker 1>you saw the growth of government as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the economy was absolutely heading </v>

358
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just,</v>

359
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:09.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain,</v>

360
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.030
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

361
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.093
<v Speaker 1>big government that hold true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's here or outside this </v>

362
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

363
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:16.361
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I look at Bernie and I think I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

365
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>

366
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent.</v>

367
00:14:21.071 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you look at the Republican side</v>

368
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and then we go back to that picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and you think,</v>

369
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>how does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that fucking happened?</v>

370
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 1>How do you get to this point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think about poor,</v>

371
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Kelly.</v>

372
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>The astronauts coming down after a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep up in the space station.</v>

373
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I hope to hell that they haven't told </v>
<v Speaker 1>them shit about what's happening.</v>

374
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.763
<v Speaker 1>Cause how funny would it be for him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>land and trump is the leading candidate </v>

375
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and nobody said anything to him yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just comes home,</v>

376
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 1>turns on the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Super Tuesday,</v>

377
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:48.910
<v Speaker 1>trump's one everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to be,</v>

378
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dealing with gravitation and all </v>

379
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this isn't</v>

380
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 3>his biggest deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't take kid like Internet up there.</v>

381
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they do.</v>

382
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 3>He's got satellite pregnancy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivery.</v>

383
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to know,</v>

384
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

385
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 3>you'd go crazy if you're completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed from life when you're up there.</v>

386
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

387
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

388
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

389
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.263
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to think that he doesn't </v>

390
00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:13.720
<v Speaker 1>know and he'd be the one person who'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get gobsmacked when he shows up here</v>

391
00:15:13.721 --> 00:15:14.710
<v Speaker 1>and finds out what's going on.</v>

392
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 3>You could run last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

393
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:16.821
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

394
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

396
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

397
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:19.740
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

398
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.573
<v Speaker 3>there's no one else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Hillary gets tossed up in this email </v>

399
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:24.944
<v Speaker 3>exchange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she gets in trouble for this and you </v>

400
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:28.161
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

401
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 3>it's Bernie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it on the,</v>

402
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 3>on the democratic side and on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican side,</v>

403
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially down to mean cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like he's fallen out of it.</v>

404
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.150
<v Speaker 3>It's Marco Rubio and Donald Trump and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubio is a distant second and people are</v>

405
00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 3>so excited about trump because he talks </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

406
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's bold and brash.</v>

407
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 3>He insults people and he's got his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

408
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.363
<v Speaker 3>He says a bunch of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a great picture of him </v>

409
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 3>where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a photo shopped picture of a,</v>

410
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.634
<v Speaker 3>somebody made a picture of him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a gun and he's pointing it out of </v>

411
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 3>the window of a car and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in Pussy.</v>

412
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.693
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make America great again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems like there's so many </v>

413
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:08.834
<v Speaker 3>like goofy white guys who are ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're ready and psyched to have trump </v>

414
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 3>as president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some insulting reality star,</v>

415
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 3>kind of a president</v>

416
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 1>who wants to impose trade sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do when when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is troubled and weak,</v>

418
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a great idea is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to shut down international trade.</v>

419
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.170
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always proven to be right.</v>

420
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Smart thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the picture.</v>

421
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Look at this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

422
00:16:38.141 --> 00:16:39.440
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my screen saver.</v>

423
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.490
<v Speaker 3>See as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be excited about this.</v>

424
00:16:42.491 --> 00:16:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be.</v>

425
00:16:43.361 --> 00:16:44.194
<v Speaker 3>I should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to have a great four years </v>

426
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.160
<v Speaker 3>when you have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have to,</v>

427
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.053
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no work involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would just go on the Internet and </v>

428
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.000
<v Speaker 3>it would be a rush to get to the stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickest with the material.</v>

429
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.013
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be the problem because </v>

430
00:16:56.561 --> 00:17:00.400
<v Speaker 3>everybody's going to have the same jokes</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the folly will be outrageous.</v>

431
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 3>I think people are excited though that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got his own money.</v>

432
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.730
<v Speaker 3>He's not entrenched in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Washington system.</v>

433
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.440
<v Speaker 3>But God dammit,</v>

434
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.690
<v Speaker 1>no it can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>

435
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't have this happen.</v>

436
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.643
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have more crisis around the world </v>

437
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.960
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More hotspots,</v>

438
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.170

439
00:17:22.171 --> 00:17:25.950
<v Speaker 1>very serious conflicts going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now is the time you would think,</v>

440
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Speaker 1>whether it comes from the left or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right that you want really clear minded,</v>

441
00:17:29.191 --> 00:17:31.020
<v Speaker 1>strategic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

442
00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:33.720
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoned leadership.</v>

443
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.000
<v Speaker 1>An essay that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

444
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure this is going to piss off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

449
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many trump supporters </v>

<v Speaker 1>but the fact that we've been having a </v>

461
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 1>conversation about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>

462
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 1>whether a guy like trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

463
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>is suited to be president is astounding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

464
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get that far in the weeds.</v>

465
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.950
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't even have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

466
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 1>You should be up at the 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot level.</v>

467
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's push that to decide.</v>

468
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 1>who oddly is impressive to me is Ben </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carson.</v>

470
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.863
<v Speaker 1>I know he believes a lot of wacky stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not entirely convinced that </v>

471
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 1>evolution is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

472
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 1>he's quite wrapped his head around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

473
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Yet he's got some wacky ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's got a great picture of himself</v>

474
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.153
<v Speaker 1>that he's painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had done at his home where it's </v>

475
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>him and Jesus is behind him and Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>has his hands on his shoulders.</v>

476
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

477
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

478
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.950
<v Speaker 1>and that is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

479
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.823
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We found it.</v>

480
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.390
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was Jesus,</v>

481
00:18:58.391 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd fucking smack him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is my head so small?</v>

482
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Why are my hands so big?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I wearing a bathrobe?</v>

483
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you and I can extenuate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird evil widow's peak thing going</v>

484
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.514
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a crease in his head like a pit </v>

485
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:10.750
<v Speaker 1>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>

486
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.603
<v Speaker 1>He looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ready to bite your face off the </v>

487
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>clean line had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right Jamie and he's wearing it.</v>

488
00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Comfy hotel bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that looks like.</v>

489
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

490
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garb from,</v>

491
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.700
<v Speaker 1>from the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Necessary at all.</v>

492
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Looks like he's just walked out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

493
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I talked to your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think they have bleach back</v>

494
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have bleach in the Jesus days?</v>

495
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean things were like natural cotton </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it.</v>

496
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they had no tide </v>
<v Speaker 1>capsules or even though I don't like how</v>

497
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 1>he made Jesus smaller than him either.</v>

498
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

499
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 1>that's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

500
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.820
<v Speaker 1>who knows who painted it for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with that.</v>

501
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that I get and get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about someone who's reasoned.</v>

502
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that he's reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not,</v>

503
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.053
<v Speaker 1>we got to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not presidential and we've gotten </v>

504
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:54.120
<v Speaker 1>to that point where there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with our system.</v>

505
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:57.040
<v Speaker 1>But one of the problems is I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

506
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.650
<v Speaker 1>are hell bent on finding the candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they agree with everything on it,</v>

507
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.583
<v Speaker 1>agrees with them on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've got my three little boys are </v>

508
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.181
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

509
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:07.014
<v Speaker 1>six and four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they know they're not going to get </v>

510
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:09.610
<v Speaker 1>everything they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

511
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>But they also know that if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they work at enough,</v>

512
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.940
<v Speaker 1>they'll get some of what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

513
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And then they're going to be happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and they'll go off and you know,</v>

514
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.240
<v Speaker 1>the day continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust their expectations,</v>

515
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 1>their expectations.</v>

516
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But nobody wants to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been in politics.</v>

517
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.993
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting everybody's splintering </v>

518
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

519
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worry obviously,</v>

520
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's not an epiphany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people talking about all the time on</v>

521
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the republican side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

522
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:33.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people throw these verbal hand grenades </v>

523
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:38.280
<v Speaker 1>out and there's no way to repair the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage once there is some nominee,</v>

524
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>if there is a nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's trying to do that.</v>

525
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Christie's now friends with Donald</v>

526
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's endorsing Donald Trump,</v>

527
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.473
<v Speaker 1>jeff sessions and Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newt Gingrich is reportedly talking to </v>

528
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

529
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.740
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>

530
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.690
<v Speaker 1>this sounds wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>

531
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 1>how do you get to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can set aside,</v>

532
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your concerns and agree to step </v>

533
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.290
<v Speaker 1>forward and say that he's the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

534
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works,</v>

535
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.090
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

536
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 1>there's not one person that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine.</v>

537
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.343
<v Speaker 1>So what you have to do is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look for the combination of character </v>

538
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:15.460
<v Speaker 1>and experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we used to do.</v>

539
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all bread and circus now.</v>

540
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit doesn't matter anymore.</v>

541
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:20.734
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going towards the third </v>

542
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>party at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>

543
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:27.631
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a president that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has any secrets.</v>

544
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.253
<v Speaker 1>They can't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of a weird kink or weird </v>

545
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:34.384
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like could you imagine if JFK was alive </v>

546
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:37.744
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of shit they would dig up on </v>

547
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:42.660
<v Speaker 1>that guy's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh cause he was at free.</v>

548
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great President.</v>

549
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.540
<v Speaker 1>But he was a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was a sexual freak and,</v>

550
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.413
<v Speaker 1>and the press corps kept that segment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it just like what they did with </v>

551
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:53.530
<v Speaker 1>the Roosevelt and being in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheelchair tacit agreement.</v>

552
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to bring this up.</v>

553
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.713
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was how they did it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then because they felt like they had a </v>

554
00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:00.760
<v Speaker 1>duty to keep America strong and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

555
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody just kept it to themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept their mouth shut.</v>

556
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean taft taft was crazy and you </v>

557
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.340
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Preston and bring up any of his</v>

558
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.833
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about when Lyndon Johnson literally </v>

559
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 1>was doing a press conference while he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a shit?</v>

560
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a true story.</v>

561
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Press conference on the toilet,</v>

562
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 1>taking a shit in front of a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporters.</v>

563
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.890
<v Speaker 1>He would talk to his cabinet guys or </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys would come in and,</v>

564
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 1>and he would be dictating notes and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

565
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squatting on the,</v>

566
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 1>on the pot there and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire,</v>

567
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:29.080
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was comfortable in his own skin.</v>

568
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

569
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 1>everything's gotten sliced and diced.</v>

571
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which is by itself also very </v>

572
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.470
<v Speaker 1>divisive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more that you do that,</v>

573
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the more you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:22:39.461 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>the country and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

575
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:41.224
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to slice this up in the </v>

576
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:42.604
<v Speaker 1>various demographics and sectors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and opinions and we're going to </v>

577
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:45.954
<v Speaker 1>go after this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well by definition you're going to end </v>

578
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:51.030
<v Speaker 1>up pitting groups against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we've been seeing.</v>

579
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's in part why we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we're so fuck now.</v>

580
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:56.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

581
00:22:56.911 --> 00:22:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a new phenomena.</v>

582
00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to throw all that on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current administration.</v>

583
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:01.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been,</v>

584
00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I think they've been more divisive than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have been unifying.</v>

585
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall as a country.</v>

586
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:07.894
<v Speaker 1>And part of it may be the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and all the rest of this </v>

587
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just seems like,</v>

588
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

589
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.743
<v Speaker 1>we're getting to the point where I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to get rid of the </v>

590
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 1>two parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

591
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep the two party system,</v>

592
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but we're gonna have to have a third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a fourth.</v>

593
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.703
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be more potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for people because that's </v>

594
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:24.960
<v Speaker 1>what they're demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

595
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:25.803
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

596
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.191
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

597
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I think there shouldn't be a president </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

598
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a ridiculous ideas to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet.</v>

599
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Just a committee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just having one guy that's in show me,</v>

600
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 1>we know he's not really in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know there's just too much shit going</v>

601
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he could be.</v>

602
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>There's not mean when something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something goes wrong,</v>

603
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said to me something,</v>

604
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>a drones,</v>

605
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.380
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about drones and Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>has blood on his hands.</v>

606
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:49.214
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really think he's in charge of </v>

607
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 2>all that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really think there's any way this</v>

608
00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:56.300
<v Speaker 2>guy could be on top of the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be on top of international trade?</v>

609
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 2>It could be on top of international </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations.</v>

610
00:23:58.281 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 2>And he's also piloting drones.</v>

611
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lawyer in the White House </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

612
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.074
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who makes that call on high value </v>

613
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 1>targets and whether we get to go or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>go a lawyer,</v>

614
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.580
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

615
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go figure.</v>

616
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>How does it know with no real national </v>
<v Speaker 1>security experience?</v>

617
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Who's The guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even say his name.</v>

618
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 1>I won't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say the name,</v>

619
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.513
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this guy decides whether or not it's </v>

620
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:23.340
<v Speaker 1>worth the potential casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

621
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.233
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a shitload of work that goes on </v>

622
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.313
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

623
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.210
<v Speaker 1>in getting to that point where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

624
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 1>we've got the target package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

625
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we go or not go?</v>

626
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

628
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people think that the,</v>

629
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agencies out there,</v>

630
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>

631
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>create a one world government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a screw everybody over.</v>

632
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

633
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck could that ever happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all that shit</v>

634
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.733
<v Speaker 2>drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FBI and CIA can't even get along </v>

635
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:51.970
<v Speaker 2>long</v>

636
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:52.631
<v Speaker 1>and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I mean,</v>

637
00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:54.750
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you don't get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

638
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.670
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are so many,</v>

639
00:24:56.671 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and maybe cause we talk about checks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>balances,</v>

640
00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 1>we talk about the Intel committees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

641
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.313
<v Speaker 1>the sort of that nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe what maybe what really keeps </v>

642
00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:06.050
<v Speaker 1>us safe from the one world government </v>
<v Speaker 1>has affected,</v>

643
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much territorial pissing that</v>

644
00:25:07.891 --> 00:25:11.280
<v Speaker 1>goes on between the different agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being is that once you get</v>

645
00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that target package and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

646
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.623
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go get approval and the </v>

647
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:17.190
<v Speaker 1>approval is not housed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the agency.</v>

648
00:25:17.191 --> 00:25:18.024
<v Speaker 1>It's not housed at the Pentagon final </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision makings over at the White </v>

649
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.281
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

650
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:23.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

651
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.150
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a legal perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once that's done,</v>

652
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.080
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you can,</v>

653
00:25:28.081 --> 00:25:30.050
<v Speaker 1>you can fire a rocket up their ass if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.000
<v Speaker 1>if they're still where they are and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get the decision made quick enough.</v>

655
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.770
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

656
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.671
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

657
00:25:35.671 --> 00:25:36.540
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>

658
00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:37.740
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your point is correct.</v>

659
00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:38.574
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president,</v>

660
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a CEO of a company,</v>

661
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know what the hell is going on</v>

662
00:25:43.261 --> 00:25:47.700
<v Speaker 1>past his division leaders or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>

663
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.133
<v Speaker 1>there's no way he could possibly know </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that are going on that </v>

664
00:25:52.891 --> 00:25:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the United States is involved with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>

665
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

666
00:25:56.731 --> 00:25:57.564
<v Speaker 1>what do we have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many different paces don't we have </v>

667
00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:01.360
<v Speaker 1>like bases in more than a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries?</v>

668
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

669
00:26:02.731 --> 00:26:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you just define a base as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>u s you know,</v>

670
00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.700
<v Speaker 1>permanent or semipermanent presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

671
00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

672
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no,</v>

673
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:10.080
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just that,</v>

674
00:26:10.081 --> 00:26:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but I mean every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every other operation that goes on,</v>

675
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>every other activity that goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

676
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.190
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

677
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.093
<v Speaker 1>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say that's why you want at </v>

678
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:21.030
<v Speaker 1>the top while we still have a president.</v>

679
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.420
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want someone who's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoned and,</v>

680
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear-eyed,</v>

681
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not thin skinned.</v>

682
00:26:27.571 --> 00:26:28.404
<v Speaker 1>She wants someone who can negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want someone who doesn't think </v>

683
00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:30.864
<v Speaker 1>they're the smartest person in the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they need to be able to pull </v>

684
00:26:34.951 --> 00:26:38.760
<v Speaker 1>together the cabinet that is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually start making decisions.</v>

685
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think presidential candidates even</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this stage,</v>

686
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 1>should be required to WHO's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their cabinet.</v>

687
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Who would be your choice for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for these various,</v>

688
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

689
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't really get brought up,</v>

690
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:52.044
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

691
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

692
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:53.151
<v Speaker 1>I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

693
00:26:53.151 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would make a big difference.</v>

694
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 1>You want to know who their team is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be and you know,</v>

695
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:00.563
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would cause a scramble for </v>

696
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.453
<v Speaker 1>top people and then you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that was all that </v>

697
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:05.210
<v Speaker 1>would mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

698
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say it's a very disappointing</v>

699
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:09.264
<v Speaker 1>political season.</v>

700
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 1>My big fear is that we're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and then one day</v>

701
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:15.234
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>govern world policy and world world </v>

702
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

703
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.443
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm a Carter for thinking this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there's a co was going </v>

704
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:28.140
<v Speaker 1>to come a point in time where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish rules of operation,</v>

705
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do no harm or do the least harm </v>

706
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

707
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:35.010
<v Speaker 1>these are the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the parameters that we need to</v>

708
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in.</v>

709
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:37.590
<v Speaker 1>These are the rules that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce.</v>

710
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And this is when something gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something like Isis,</v>

711
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>when it gets to a point where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>agrees,</v>

712
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a,</v>

713
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.700
<v Speaker 1>we have a tremendous issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to do something militarily,</v>

714
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.520
<v Speaker 1>strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

715
00:27:49.521 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 1>some choices have to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

716
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And that you could punch this in somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another to something,</v>

717
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.960
<v Speaker 1>some sort of artificial intelligence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will dish out some sort of a decision</v>

718
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.690
<v Speaker 1>based upon the rules of engagement based</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon the,</v>

719
00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 1>the agreed upon parameters that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

720
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

721
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:09.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of marching it,</v>

722
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I know what the world would get to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

723
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:12.384
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we certainly work games scenarios out </v>

724
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.423
<v Speaker 1>where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're running a large number of </v>

725
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.000
<v Speaker 1>potential possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

726
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.530
<v Speaker 1>through the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

727
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and it is literally like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spitting out,</v>

728
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely outcomes.</v>

729
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.523
<v Speaker 1>And you're weighing that against me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one big part that it's always </v>

730
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 1>missed because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

731
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:30.900
<v Speaker 1>there's this tendency to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

732
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 1>people are just out there doing shit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell of it,</v>

733
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.673
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big risk versus gain </v>

734
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.654
<v Speaker 1>calculation that goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's at the agency or the </v>

735
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 1>military anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're constantly evaluating this</v>

736
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 1>and part of that eventually becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>political risk,</v>

737
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 1>political blow back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

738
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the Benghazi thing.</v>

739
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.460
<v Speaker 1>How did I end up on that?</v>

740
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you look at Benghazi and you think,</v>

741
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the part I don't understand about</v>

742
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not that you asked,</v>

743
00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:57.684
<v Speaker 1>but all they had to do during the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that attack and they had no idea how </v>

744
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:03.354
<v Speaker 1>long that attack was going to go on for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they had to do was put the birds up </v>

745
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 1>with the guys in them and head towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bengazi.</v>

746
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>That's all they had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this would not have ever been a</v>

747
00:29:13.261 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably wouldn't have gotten there</v>

748
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 1>in time to save lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would've gotten there.</v>

749
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:19.320
<v Speaker 1>They would have been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have secured the facility,</v>

750
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they would have helped with the dust to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean up and they it,</v>

751
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.183
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't have been an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that they could all be </v>

752
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:29.490
<v Speaker 1>sitting around in the war room watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and not have that,</v>

753
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop in their heads because three to four</v>

754
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>weeks down the road was a national </v>
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

755
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And all I could imagine was who's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be some goat rope.</v>

756
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.463
<v Speaker 1>And they couldn't get the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where they thought there'd </v>

757
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 1>be zero risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't any sense.</v>

758
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:42.544
<v Speaker 1>All those guys on the ground wanted was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know that the calvary had been </v>

759
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't expect to be saved,</v>

760
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 1>but they thought that help would be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>its way because that's what you do.</v>

761
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.991
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

762
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you talk about,</v>

763
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:53.404
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios in war gaming and potential </v>

764
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:56.794
<v Speaker 1>political blow back and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating world where you sit </v>

765
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 1>in a war room and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides are being debated.</v>

766
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.973
<v Speaker 1>My perspective on my gaseous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand why they didn't </v>

767
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 1>just try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they had to do.</v>

768
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.330
<v Speaker 1>And so we would have been a stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the election.</v>

769
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:11.843
<v Speaker 1>I think there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were more political </v>

770
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 1>operatives in that room then a then </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactical operators.</v>

771
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think that somebody got jammed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

772
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to spin them up and send </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

773
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it was probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

774
00:30:25.941 --> 00:30:26.774
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand it's speculation and I get </v>

775
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:29.494
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not one of those people that </v>

776
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 1>said they could have saved those lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't happen.</v>

777
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.393
<v Speaker 1>But I just don't understand the simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept that one of those political </v>

778
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 1>operatives who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

779
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 1>if we don't try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

780
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 1>we might get fucked on this.</v>

781
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't there also be a scenario or at</v>

782
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:45.244
<v Speaker 3>least a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a rule in place that whenever </v>

783
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 3>there's an attack you send in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops,</v>

784
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.383
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the component that you're </v>

785
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:51.514
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be keeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a promise is supposed to be </v>

786
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:53.884
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I promise that's a great </v>

787
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:55.940
<v Speaker 3>way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why all those,</v>

788
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 3>all the guys have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:59.100
<v Speaker 3>in the folks that were in that program</v>

790
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody I know was,</v>

791
00:31:00.901 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 1>is people say why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you be fixated on this?</v>

792
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.341
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

793
00:31:05.341 --> 00:31:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this important?</v>

794
00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.051
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:08.220
<v Speaker 1>like Hillary Clinton said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Ma,</v>

796
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.030
<v Speaker 1>what difference does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

797
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.873
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for that reason that you said there </v>

798
00:31:13.081 --> 00:31:13.914
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this understanding that you </v>

799
00:31:16.801 --> 00:31:17.634
<v Speaker 1>will make the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll try and nobody out there on that </v>

800
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.940
<v Speaker 1>pointy edge of the spear expects that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be saved.</v>

801
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.160
<v Speaker 1>But they do expect that someone's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to call the calvary</v>

802
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.040
<v Speaker 3>and throw the idea that you're left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging to be hung out to dry with an a.</v>

803
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's no resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it doesn't make any sense.</v>

804
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no sources.</v>

805
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's so disturbing to people.</v>

806
00:31:37.791 --> 00:31:39.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like if this was a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision,</v>

807
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like to try to minimize blow back </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the election coming up.</v>

808
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.920
<v Speaker 3>So let's just not do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that was the decision,</v>

809
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:46.933
<v Speaker 3>well that that's contrary to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose of having military in the first </v>

810
00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:50.174
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's a fucking attack he </v>

811
00:31:51.441 --> 00:31:52.274
<v Speaker 3>supposed to send in the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly attack on your facilities </v>

812
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.843
<v Speaker 3>and particularly to make sure that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking never happens again because you </v>

813
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.613
<v Speaker 3>know that every time there's an election</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up and well they're not going to </v>

814
00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:04.364
<v Speaker 3>do shit because there's an election </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up in two weeks now we can go in </v>

815
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:07.910
<v Speaker 3>and it's time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

816
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy precedent to set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

817
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Well it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

818
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:10.920
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

819
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>

820
00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

821
00:32:13.881 --> 00:32:14.714
<v Speaker 1>in looking at it all the various </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios and knowing what resources </v>

822
00:32:16.851 --> 00:32:20.300
<v Speaker 1>were available and knowing what the guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected on the ground,</v>

823
00:32:20.301 --> 00:32:21.134
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

824
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

825
00:32:22.641 --> 00:32:23.474
<v Speaker 1>for a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning the administration that's </v>

826
00:32:25.041 --> 00:32:27.920
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be so clever and politically</v>
<v Speaker 1>savvy,</v>

827
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.143
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now they've been having to suffer </v>

828
00:32:30.561 --> 00:32:32.990
<v Speaker 1>with it ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And aside from the fact that they did,</v>

829
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:35.570
<v Speaker 1>judges didn't fucking make the effort to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to save these people.</v>

830
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that they would have,</v>

831
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 1>but how do you not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you not try?</v>

832
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

833
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

834
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:43.514
<v Speaker 3>Whenever they're making decisions based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on whether or not there's an election </v>

835
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 3>coming up and you would do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently if there was and in people's</v>

836
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:55.211
<v Speaker 3>lives could be lost because an elections</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up versus how you would behave.</v>

837
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 3>It was first term or first year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first term.</v>

838
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all madness.</v>

839
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a risk aversion,</v>

840
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that takes hold.</v>

841
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And we got to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just a recent thing,</v>

842
00:33:05.881 --> 00:33:07.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not just this administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:33:07.411 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this,</v>

844
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.163
<v Speaker 1>this understanding or this belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow that we can get to a zero risk </v>

845
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 1>on a military operation or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence operation.</v>

846
00:33:16.021 --> 00:33:16.854
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so show me that we won't have </v>

847
00:33:19.111 --> 00:33:19.831
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

848
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.270
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

849
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.163
<v Speaker 1>You're at a risk taking business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to try to minimize that risk </v>

850
00:33:24.271 --> 00:33:26.040
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>

851
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:26.874
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your decision making gets to that </v>

852
00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:29.214
<v Speaker 1>point and you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it starts feeding down through the </v>

853
00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:36.420
<v Speaker 1>ranks and you start getting mid level </v>
<v Speaker 1>managers rising up who believed that,</v>

854
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

855
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.180
<v Speaker 1>a good watch is when nothing happens on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their watch.</v>

856
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.690
<v Speaker 1>You've got a real problem because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic.</v>

857
00:33:42.691 --> 00:33:43.524
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't,</v>

858
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

859
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to rush you out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

860
00:33:46.471 --> 00:33:47.291
<v Speaker 1>until you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

861
00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:48.510
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a game plan,</v>

862
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know what you're doing </v>

863
00:33:49.591 --> 00:33:51.780
<v Speaker 1>operationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

864
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.713
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain things that are worth </v>

865
00:33:53.461 --> 00:33:56.340
<v Speaker 1>bend and you spear over now for a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you</v>

866
00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.223
<v Speaker 3>that was in the CIA for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been involved in this stuff for so </v>

867
00:34:00.091 --> 00:34:02.760
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How exhausting is all of this because it</v>

868
00:34:02.761 --> 00:34:05.970
<v Speaker 3>seems to me that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it never ends.</v>

869
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.180
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you</v>

870
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.393
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

871
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.430
<v Speaker 3>is step back for a little while and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just piles up more.</v>

872
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indeed.</v>

873
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.870
<v Speaker 3>If you retire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new guy comes in and you look at the</v>

874
00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:17.704
<v Speaker 3>new guy doing it and like the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit's happening and it doesn't seem </v>

875
00:34:19.721 --> 00:34:20.554
<v Speaker 3>like anybody put a dent in anything and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it continues to go on like the Middle </v>

876
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.230
<v Speaker 3>East at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What point in time?</v>

877
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean how I know what you're getting at</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

878
00:34:28.001 --> 00:34:30.850
<v Speaker 3>That seems pretty buttoned up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got that under control.</v>

879
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.230
<v Speaker 3>It's the craziest fucking place in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

880
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.170
<v Speaker 3>It's the if the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

881
00:34:38.171 --> 00:34:40.510
<v Speaker 3>let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the whole world was serious,</v>

882
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.183
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

883
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.380
<v Speaker 3>It was just one big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big series.</v>

884
00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

885
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.910
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck if the whole world he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olivia.</v>

886
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Imagine the whole world was Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

888
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

889
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

890
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 1>if you had told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spent a lot of time trying to get the</v>

891
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Soviets out of Afghanistan during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the</v>

892
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:03.854
<v Speaker 1>Soviet strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend a lot of time trying to get </v>

893
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:06.980
<v Speaker 1>themselves out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About four years into their occupation,</v>

894
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they realize,</v>

895
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 1>and we know this because we've seen the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:12.320
<v Speaker 1>the Kremlin papers and we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>access to a lot of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their thinking at that time.</v>

898
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

899
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 1>after about year four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

900
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:20.000
<v Speaker 1>this is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta get Outta here.</v>

901
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:20.834
<v Speaker 1>But what could they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they spent the next five years or so </v>

902
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.330
<v Speaker 1>try a variety of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to,</v>

903
00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:26.164
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to find a government are </v>

904
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:28.634
<v Speaker 1>individuals that they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could leave and place that we </v>

905
00:35:30.501 --> 00:35:31.760
<v Speaker 1>continue to push their agenda.</v>

906
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.860
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't find anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were dealing with corruption.</v>

907
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:34.940
<v Speaker 1>We know that they couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

908
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:36.860
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't get past a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

909
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:37.694
<v Speaker 1>That sounds familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They retreated from the countryside and </v>

910
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:40.801
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

911
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll just hold the urban centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's exactly what we did.</v>

912
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 1>So they went through the same problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we did.</v>

913
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:51.141
<v Speaker 1>If you would said anything when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there handing a weapons systems,</v>

914
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:52.374
<v Speaker 1>the Musha Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in retrospect maybe that wasn't a </v>

915
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

916
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.220
<v Speaker 1>but if you had told us that we'd be back</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half decades later,</v>

917
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.290
<v Speaker 1>doing the same thing that the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing,</v>

918
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

919
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to do,</v>

920
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.870
<v Speaker 1>build a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

921
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell democracy where they don't have a </v>

922
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:12.460
<v Speaker 1>fucking clue what we were selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

923
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 1>so we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is what,</v>

924
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying.</v>

925
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.233
<v Speaker 1>We don't learn from our mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why that's the probably the </v>

926
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:19.374
<v Speaker 1>most tiring part is watching shit happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and cycles and every </v>

927
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>generation thinks they can do it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

928
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good thing probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of Hubris involved,</v>

929
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:29.183
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thinking that you're going to do </v>

930
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:31.650
<v Speaker 1>this somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be different this time.</v>

931
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy debating this guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will remain anonymous.</v>

933
00:36:36.901 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Speaker 1>She was in the military and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

934
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 1>we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in Afghanistan,</v>

935
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point already with trying to </v>

936
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.513
<v Speaker 1>nation build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was very pessimistic about the </v>

937
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:51.540
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kept saying this a fucking,</v>

938
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

939
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:53.663
<v Speaker 1>this is not what we should be doing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>our boys are women as well and the </v>

940
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 1>resources and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

941
00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're after here.</v>

942
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And we did a great tactical mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.140
<v Speaker 1>right after nine 11 we did a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound like trump.</v>

944
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the mission.</v>

945
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What great attack,</v>

946
00:37:10.611 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 1>tactical missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>

947
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:12.594
<v Speaker 1>about springtime in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have gotten the fuck out so </v>

948
00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 1>that if you do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to come back.</v>

949
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.983
<v Speaker 1>And we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stayed because we wanted to build a </v>

950
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 1>road or improve their literacy rate by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of points.</v>

951
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So this guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

952
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's different this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was saying,</v>

953
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work for the Russians.</v>

954
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think it's gonna work for us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

955
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:28.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hated the Russians.</v>

956
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.510
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

957
00:37:30.511 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your reasoning is because somehow</v>

958
00:37:32.551 --> 00:37:34.710
<v Speaker 1>they like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they or they,</v>

959
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fill chocolate bars out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him and they,</v>

961
00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:38.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to end and stockings and </v>

962
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come running.</v>

963
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell is that point?</v>

964
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 1>But we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mentality that we're going to do it</v>

965
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 1>better this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at,</v>

966
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

967
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 1>you look at Isis for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

968
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.010
<v Speaker 1>who couldn't have guessed if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely walk out,</v>

969
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you can debate all sorts of things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

970
00:37:57.751 --> 00:38:00.510
<v Speaker 1>but who couldn't have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll walk out of that place,</v>

971
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 1>it was going to devolve into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you leave a vacuum,</v>

972
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we've got.</v>

973
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 1>But we keep doing the same things over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

974
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And you could argue what we've doing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>

975
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:15.090
<v Speaker 1>We did all those years ago after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviets left Afghanistan.</v>

976
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And so we left and it evolved into what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it devolves into.</v>

977
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 1>And oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of neo cons who thought</v>

978
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>that was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We felt guilty about that.</v>

979
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:26.040
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to get it right this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

980
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 1>We're going to stay not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to the Soviets.</v>

981
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

982
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.313
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Mccain was debating </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama when they were running for </v>

983
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>president and Obama was</v>

984
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.360
<v Speaker 2>talking about going into Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

985
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I remember this is a very sobering </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment where Mccain said,</v>

986
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.543
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about going to </v>

987
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just going to send troops in.</v>

988
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand that place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was clear that Obama didn't,</v>

989
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:50.254
<v Speaker 2>you could tell by his body language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could tell by the way he was </v>

990
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:57.370
<v Speaker 2>speaking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mccain had this really clear sentence.</v>

991
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.593
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that plays hasn't changed since </v>

992
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the Great was running it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

993
00:39:02.991 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 2>when he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like,</v>

994
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

995
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 2>So then I started researching </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

996
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.250
<v Speaker 2>then I started researching the terrain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how crazy it is.</v>

997
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like literally like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control like the rocky mountains,</v>

998
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 2>like the back country out of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so remote.</v>

999
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.173
<v Speaker 2>It's so impossible to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you find out that there's </v>

1000
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 2>really only one city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Kabul in the entire country.</v>

1001
00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 2>This basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1002
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.830
<v Speaker 2>it was a few little towns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one city.</v>

1003
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just warm.</v>

1004
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't know what they don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been trying to sell them.</v>

1005
00:39:34.081 --> 00:39:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Iraq.</v>

1006
00:39:35.671 --> 00:39:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya's a complete hot mess.</v>

1007
00:39:38.851 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1008
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 2>isn't it crazy that getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Qaddafi made Libya</v>

1009
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 1>worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1010
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:45.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it Kadafi here's the,</v>

1011
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that wacky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kadafi was kind of our guy,</v>

1012
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on counter terrorism for a few years </v>

1013
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:52.610
<v Speaker 1>before he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 1>got pushed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because he had,</v>

1015
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.980
<v Speaker 1>he had found Jesus and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not literally I guess.</v>

1016
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1017
00:39:57.701 --> 00:39:59.090
<v Speaker 1>however they put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1018
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.393
<v Speaker 1>and he had started to cooperate with us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the Arab spring happened and </v>

1019
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:08.260
<v Speaker 1>then there was this bizarre belief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy was going to sweep through the</v>

1020
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:09.094
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Italians and French came to us </v>

1021
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:10.841
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 1>we've got lots of interests there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya,</v>

1023
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.400
<v Speaker 1>widget back us up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had no national security interests in</v>

1024
00:40:15.401 --> 00:40:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Libya and yet we went in and we did what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did and now it's a shit hole.</v>

1025
00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 1>It's 130 some odd tribes in Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're still talking right now.</v>

1026
00:40:23.261 --> 00:40:24.094
<v Speaker 1>We're still talking as if somehow we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to find a federal government and </v>

1027
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:27.490
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going to help us.</v>

1028
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Because then one of the genitals just </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out yesterday or today or whenever,</v>

1029
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1030
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:33.094
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the Olympian Olympians are</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to take care of isis </v>

1031
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:38.740
<v Speaker 1>themselves because Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've got a very strong,</v>

1032
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:39.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holden in Libya because they're smart </v>

1033
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 1>because they realize they're having </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems in Syria and Iraq.</v>

1034
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:45.580
<v Speaker 1>They've been looking for another place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya is chaotic.</v>

1035
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:46.721
<v Speaker 1>So the general says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1036
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:47.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1037
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once we get this unified government,</v>

1038
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>then we can work on training and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assisting and providing resources and it</v>

1039
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 1>just over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to answer your original question,</v>

1040
00:40:56.651 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 1>but in a very roundabout way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1041
00:40:58.331 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1042
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it's tiring because you see the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit</v>

1043
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.310
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine just trying,</v>

1045
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 2>just trying to nation build the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing these people that,</v>

1046
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with completely different</v>

1047
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different cultures.</v>

1048
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:17.284
<v Speaker 2>Completely different educations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are so backwards so far gone </v>

1049
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.433
<v Speaker 2>that taking a 45 year old man who is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and crazy and religious and </v>

1050
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>trying to convert him to the ways of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>west,</v>

1051
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:31.323
<v Speaker 2>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking people that executed that </v>

1052
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:34.110
<v Speaker 2>kid the other day in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq's yeah.</v>

1053
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.910
<v Speaker 3>For playing music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Because he was playing western music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They beheaded him.</v>

1055
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably don't understand that.</v>

1056
00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:41.020
<v Speaker 1>We can't process it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have never been able to,</v>

1057
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you talk about the Viet Cong and we used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go in and you know,</v>

1058
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.093
<v Speaker 1>we thought we were helping a village and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the hockey league village and </v>

1059
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:48.220
<v Speaker 1>the Viet Cong in to come in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them because,</v>

1060
00:41:48.221 --> 00:41:49.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd had contact with us.</v>

1061
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 1>One of the first people that we hired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1062
00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometime ago from my company and </v>

1063
00:41:55.381 --> 00:41:56.530
<v Speaker 1>diligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>needs a little plot.</v>

1065
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:00.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the first guys we hired was a </v>

1066
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Russian came out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gru.</v>

1067
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1068
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.190
<v Speaker 1>right after we'd gone in for the tour </v>
<v Speaker 1>bore operation,</v>

1069
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.083
<v Speaker 1>he came to me and he had been a tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver out in Afghanistan during the </v>

1070
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.730
<v Speaker 1>occupation for the Russians and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1071
00:42:18.731 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came and he,</v>

1072
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.930
<v Speaker 1>you could just see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the intensity on his face,</v>

1073
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1074
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.423
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1075
00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I had known him for a while and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1076
00:42:27.101 --> 00:42:29.070
<v Speaker 1>he grabbed me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1077
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.520
<v Speaker 1>he said that was brilliant.</v>

1078
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.830
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning Tora Bora,</v>

1079
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.580
<v Speaker 1>meaning what we have quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had acted.</v>

1080
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.690
<v Speaker 1>He said that was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1081
00:42:34.691 --> 00:42:35.620
<v Speaker 1>don't stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1082
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.120
<v Speaker 1>don't stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like cockroaches.</v>

1083
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.090
<v Speaker 1>He says [inaudible] meaning you step on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them here,</v>

1084
00:42:40.091 --> 00:42:43.570
<v Speaker 1>they show up over here and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just see in his face and that,</v>

1085
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.670
<v Speaker 1>that son of a bitch was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I'd been smart,</v>

1086
00:42:45.671 --> 00:42:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I would have dragged him back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>states and taking them into the Pentagon</v>

1087
00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.180
<v Speaker 1>and had them say that every hour on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

1088
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until somebody figured out what the hell</v>

1089
00:42:55.121 --> 00:42:56.970
<v Speaker 1>we should have been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1090
00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.660
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1091
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.510
<v Speaker 1>we don't seem to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to jump in.</v>

1092
00:43:01.511 --> 00:43:02.344
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to take charge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you need somebody who's in </v>

1093
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:06.243
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a leader at the top of this </v>

1094
00:43:06.971 --> 00:43:09.310
<v Speaker 1>food chain around the world because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have,</v>

1095
00:43:09.311 --> 00:43:10.144
<v Speaker 1>when you get what we get now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that part of the problem </v>

1096
00:43:12.041 --> 00:43:14.770
<v Speaker 1>we have is the administration for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever their motivation,</v>

1097
00:43:14.771 --> 00:43:16.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever their reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1098
00:43:16.241 --> 00:43:16.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

1099
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:17.680
<v Speaker 1>they want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their,</v>

1100
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.593
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've stepped off the world stage to </v>

1101
00:43:20.081 --> 00:43:20.914
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be the world's </v>

1102
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.780
<v Speaker 1>policemen are the world's lead or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be at the top.</v>

1103
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.823
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if suddenly a community of </v>

1104
00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:29.584
<v Speaker 1>nations fills that void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some other interest is going to try to </v>

1105
00:43:33.101 --> 00:43:35.730
<v Speaker 1>become the top dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the fucking way.</v>

1106
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.813
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like there's a balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's already been achieved and you </v>

1107
00:43:38.711 --> 00:43:41.140
<v Speaker 3>have to maintain that balance some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some way,</v>

1108
00:43:41.141 --> 00:43:43.380
<v Speaker 3>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would respond to us,</v>

1109
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>be at the top of the food chain because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1110
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.470
<v Speaker 1>and some people will argue and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

1111
00:43:47.471 --> 00:43:48.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the folks who think we never act in </v>

1112
00:43:49.181 --> 00:43:51.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] best interest of anybody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just</v>

1113
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.040
<v Speaker 3>pretend I'm them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1114
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 3>It's the greatest terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

1115
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1116
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Don't you know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1117
00:43:58.371 --> 00:44:01.670
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spin invading countries forever,</v>

1118
00:44:01.671 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just leave them alone just</v>

1119
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.250
<v Speaker 3>for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:07.050
<v Speaker 3>All we want is oil and gemstones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds.</v>

1121
00:44:07.051 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 3>We definitely want that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't want that stuff.</v>

1122
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.740
<v Speaker 3>The problem is we want that stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1124
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:14.810
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that cut and dry.</v>

1125
00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:15.644
<v Speaker 3>You've got some fucked up parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and the more I talked to people </v>

1126
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.630
<v Speaker 3>that have been the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucked up parts of the world,</v>

1127
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.410
<v Speaker 3>the more that picture is starting to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear and clear.</v>

1128
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:25.363
<v Speaker 3>The Mar Mar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to guys like Jocko willink </v>

1129
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 3>who've been over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seals,</v>

1130
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>people that have served over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get this of this place that's</v>

1131
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.993
<v Speaker 2>not America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get a lot of people that are </v>

1132
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 2>talking about the rest of the world as </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're talking about America,</v>

1133
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:41.350
<v Speaker 2>like bad spots in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like oil.</v>

1134
00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:42.184
<v Speaker 2>We need to fix Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it says fucking fix in Chicago's </v>

1135
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn cake walk compared to fixing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cabo or fixing any of these spots in the</v>

1136
00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:49.374
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>

1137
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1138
00:44:50.061 --> 00:44:50.750
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>

1139
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.540
<v Speaker 1>we could be at the top of the global </v>
<v Speaker 1>food chain and still fixed Chicago.</v>

1140
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can multitask.</v>

1141
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 1>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that,</v>

1142
00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent enough time behind the curtain,</v>

1143
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.670
<v Speaker 1>a of the u s government and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.420
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my view was his college somewhat.</v>

1145
00:45:05.421 --> 00:45:06.254
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I understand everybody's got their </v>

1146
00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.140
<v Speaker 1>opinions based on their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their experiences,</v>

1147
00:45:09.141 --> 00:45:10.490
<v Speaker 1>my experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

1148
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1149
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe the US government is out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to fuck everybody over.</v>

1150
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.690
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they make a mistake.</v>

1151
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.570
<v Speaker 1>We tend to be a pretty self correcting </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>

1152
00:45:20.571 --> 00:45:22.400
<v Speaker 1>We try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it takes awhile,</v>

1153
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1154
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.630
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather us be the ones up there,</v>

1155
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

1156
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.720
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct traffic.</v>

1157
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.793
<v Speaker 1>Then some other nations like China or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia or Iran for the Middle East just </v>

1158
00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:39.290
<v Speaker 1>make decision making and we don't always</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it right.</v>

1159
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:40.123
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do have to have checks and </v>

1160
00:45:41.211 --> 00:45:42.720
<v Speaker 1>balances of course your fucking toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1161
00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:43.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1162
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where people always,</v>

1163
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall on one side of there while you're </v>

1164
00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:47.444
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you want to do is steal oil and </v>

1165
00:45:48.591 --> 00:45:49.640
<v Speaker 1>treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1166
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.773
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to try to ensure that we've got </v>

1167
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.860
<v Speaker 1>some good intent at the top of the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain and I think the u s is,</v>

1168
00:45:56.861 --> 00:45:59.600
<v Speaker 1>is well positioned for that because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>try,</v>

1169
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.190
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't always get it right,</v>

1170
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:06.020
<v Speaker 1>but we make that effort so people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree and I'm sure they are right now</v>

1171
00:46:06.021 --> 00:46:06.854
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1172
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.240
<v Speaker 1>he's got an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

1173
00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:10.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

1174
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1175
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.983
<v Speaker 2>you actually have a qualified opinion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the difference between your </v>

1176
00:46:14.691 --> 00:46:17.510
<v Speaker 2>opinion and someone who's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

1177
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to stay out of other countries,</v>

1178
00:46:19.521 --> 00:46:20.354
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Th I think we need to pay attention to </v>

1179
00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:25.220
<v Speaker 2>what's going on outside of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States for sure.</v>

1180
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.593
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know what you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly do to sort of smooth over the </v>

1181
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Middle East and bring them up to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how you could,</v>

1182
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.660
<v Speaker 2>how do you bring Isis up to date?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say,</v>

1183
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.670
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

1184
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you can't execute 15 year old kids for </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to rap music.</v>

1185
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't negotiate.</v>

1186
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.843
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an organization that we're </v>

1187
00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:47.370
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to deal with in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1188
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:48.030
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1189
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.830
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that would make us all feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy because we talk them down from,</v>

1190
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ledge and,</v>

1191
00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:54.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I could have committed violence</v>

1192
00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:55.484
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1193
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.210
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1194
00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.160
<v Speaker 1>and you can't also kill your way out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1195
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.080
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other part of it.</v>

1196
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:04.430
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1197
00:47:04.431 --> 00:47:05.264
<v Speaker 1>you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to manage it and you manage it </v>

1198
00:47:07.761 --> 00:47:12.761
<v Speaker 1>in part by not allowing the extremist to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their own fucking territory because</v>

1199
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that caliphate that they'd been Jonesing</v>

1200
00:47:16.371 --> 00:47:17.204
<v Speaker 1>for all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why they've </v>

1201
00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:22.040
<v Speaker 1>been having so much success in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruiting foreign fighters.</v>

1202
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.053
<v Speaker 1>And that's when a shit load of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into that place and they do it </v>

1203
00:47:25.341 --> 00:47:26.390
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

1204
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:27.680
<v Speaker 1>we finally got our own turf.</v>

1205
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Now we can take that turf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1206
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.641
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1207
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:31.474
<v Speaker 1>it's now much more problematic because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we sat on the sidelines for some time </v>

1208
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:34.624
<v Speaker 1>and the Russians are in there and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to get into a shooting match with </v>

1209
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:37.114
<v Speaker 1>the Russians at this stage of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But denying them territory and then </v>

1210
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:42.184
<v Speaker 1>realizing that like with cockroaches are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pop up over here and then </v>

1211
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:46.180
<v Speaker 1>they've got a more fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be over here.</v>

1212
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.400
<v Speaker 1>We're just gonna have to play whack a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mole for the rest of our lives.</v>

1213
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Probably this doesn't go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can minimize it.</v>

1214
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:52.653
<v Speaker 1>And we can be aggressive enough without </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we're going to try to nation </v>

1215
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:58.630
<v Speaker 1>build and also sell them something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand.</v>

1216
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1217
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't,</v>

1218
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:05.530
<v Speaker 1>having sat on the sidelines for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've created more of a mess,</v>

1219
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this stage of the game,</v>

1220
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:10.100
<v Speaker 1>the Russian and Iranian influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1221
00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 1>in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1222
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.723
<v Speaker 1>the neurons have more influence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East now than they've had in </v>

1223
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 1>modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is this.</v>

1224
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:20.320
<v Speaker 1>They can't imagine their good fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now what are we doing one?</v>

1225
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Now the headlines are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1226
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:22.054
<v Speaker 1>they just had elections and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reformists are winning as if somehow </v>

1227
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Rod's going to change its tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

1228
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:31.660
<v Speaker 1>We've had that hope for decades and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

1229
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 1>and every time there's a little glimmer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1230
00:48:33.371 --> 00:48:34.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the reformist,</v>

1231
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 1>the moderates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1232
00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:37.670
<v Speaker 1>are going to rise up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1233
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen.</v>

1234
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:39.763
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't we have a part of that too </v>

1235
00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:41.870
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1236
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1237
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.210
<v Speaker 2>we brought in the ayatollah to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the shah.</v>

1238
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1239
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.310
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1240
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:50.510
<v Speaker 2>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1241
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:51.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't,</v>

1242
00:48:51.141 --> 00:48:54.170
<v Speaker 2>so much foam ended as we just stood by </v>
<v Speaker 2>and watched it happen.</v>

1243
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And so what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1244
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.450
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't sort of influenced that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1245
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Now the shot was our guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shah was our gunshot was our guy.</v>

1246
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.680
<v Speaker 2>We brought in the shot though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1247
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1248
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1249
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:06.790
<v Speaker 1>and the Shah was a son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1250
00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 1>just in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1251
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankly,</v>

1252
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.800
<v Speaker 2>it was not much different than Bashir </v>
<v Speaker 2>Assad or Assad's Dad.</v>

1253
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.370
<v Speaker 2>I got it confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ayatollah came in and how did the</v>

1254
00:49:16.371 --> 00:49:17.204
<v Speaker 2>ayatollah get into,</v>

1255
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in exile in France and,</v>

1256
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.533
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had been for some time because of </v>

1257
00:49:22.941 --> 00:49:26.690
<v Speaker 1>the brutality of the Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had been a hard line,</v>

1258
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>a clerical uprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:31.640
<v Speaker 1>sort of directing traffic amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

1260
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.130
<v Speaker 2>And so the Shah who was our guy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal and he was fucking up.</v>

1261
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1262
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:37.144
<v Speaker 1>And he had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a very brutal intelligence </v>

1263
00:49:37.961 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1264
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was,</v>

1265
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't a happy chapter in the sense</v>

1266
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1267
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the Shah our guy?</v>

1268
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1269
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but have we had other guys that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1270
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 1>dead spots or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

1271
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:55.930
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desk spots is just really unsavory.</v>

1272
00:49:55.931 --> 00:50:00.931
<v Speaker 1>People that in an ideal world you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want to associate with,</v>

1273
00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 1>but the real world doesn't work that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1274
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:04.510
<v Speaker 1>There are some fucked up people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1275
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:05.344
<v Speaker 1>And the fact of the matter is sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to deal with a person that's </v>

1276
00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:08.820
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1277
00:50:08.821 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that was the argument about,</v>

1278
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.130
<v Speaker 2>but what's going on in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1279
00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the audit or the argument about</v>

1280
00:50:14.781 --> 00:50:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about Saddam Hussein was a horrible</v>

1281
00:50:16.971 --> 00:50:18.890
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a dangerous guy.</v>

1282
00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.380
<v Speaker 2>But getting rid of them might be worth.</v>

1283
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:22.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were a number of people </v>

1284
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.560
<v Speaker 1>that said that and what turned that tide</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people will,</v>

1285
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like trump himself,</v>

1286
00:50:28.911 --> 00:50:29.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1287
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:30.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush lied.</v>

1288
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 1>People died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1289
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 1>it was only George Bush who thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was weapons of mass distraction.</v>

1290
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Lady shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1291
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.123
<v Speaker 2>if he gets an office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to find out the truth about </v>

1292
00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:40.230
<v Speaker 2>who brought the towers down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1293
00:50:40.231 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking truther.</v>

1294
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.800
<v Speaker 2>He's a truth or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1295
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.320
<v Speaker 2>he's also remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember he's a birther,</v>

1296
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.140
<v Speaker 2>he thinks Obama was born in Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>

1297
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's conveniently ignored this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1298
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is going after the obvious shit.</v>

1299
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know about that.</v>

1300
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.300
<v Speaker 2>The truth or bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1301
00:50:57.301 --> 00:50:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps,</v>

1302
00:50:58.201 --> 00:51:00.870
<v Speaker 2>keeps piling on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a recent statement that he made.</v>

1303
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1304
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1305
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:08.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that,</v>

1306
00:51:08.171 --> 00:51:09.400
<v Speaker 1>how again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it,</v>

1307
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.490
<v Speaker 1>how does it happen that this country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic country?</v>

1308
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent most of my life overseas.</v>

1309
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I can go to the deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkest shit somewhere out there,</v>

1310
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 1>middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone will,</v>

1311
00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.840
<v Speaker 1>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go to America,</v>

1312
00:51:22.841 --> 00:51:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I can work this hard and I can do really</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1313
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:26.711
<v Speaker 1>I just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1314
00:51:26.711 --> 00:51:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can get to America,</v>

1315
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.610
<v Speaker 1>they still people out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of nowhere,</v>

1316
00:51:30.611 --> 00:51:31.444
<v Speaker 1>still believe the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet you worry about it because I </v>

1317
00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:38.620
<v Speaker 1>think we seem to be given up on it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this is the best we've got,</v>

1318
00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:40.660
<v Speaker 1>if we're willing to follow this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1319
00:51:40.661 --> 00:51:42.850
<v Speaker 1>down the down the tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1320
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I know where we're heading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good.</v>

1321
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:45.783
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also worry about part of it with </v>

1322
00:51:48.461 --> 00:51:49.294
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders going back to him is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think sometimes the young people who </v>

1323
00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:54.334
<v Speaker 1>support him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is sort of being </v>

1324
00:51:56.321 --> 00:51:57.220
<v Speaker 1>disheartened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1325
00:51:57.221 --> 00:52:00.430
<v Speaker 1>since 2008 they don't see themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being part of the American dream.</v>

1326
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't imagine yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>working hard and becoming wealthy,</v>

1327
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.820
<v Speaker 1>then you don't give a shit whether tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates go up to 85% or not.</v>

1328
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to you because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to be you.</v>

1329
00:52:09.311 --> 00:52:10.510
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be somebody else.</v>

1330
00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so confusing to people that no</v>

1331
00:52:13.661 --> 00:52:14.500
<v Speaker 2>one can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1332
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody had these hopes and dreams for</v>

1333
00:52:16.931 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Obama and he was going to get an office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this,</v>

1334
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:22.420
<v Speaker 2>this lady that was when Obama got </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected,</v>

1335
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.860
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1336
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.400
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was so happy and she was saying,</v>

1337
00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy because now I know that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1338
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.400
<v Speaker 2>my mortgage needs to be paid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to help me.</v>

1339
00:52:33.401 --> 00:52:34.234
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this really weird like moment </v>

1340
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:38.920
<v Speaker 2>where I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1341
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.990
<v Speaker 2>these people don't really understand how</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex this entire system is.</v>

1342
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.540
<v Speaker 2>And you dealing with a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping into the office,</v>

1343
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When all these banks are failing,</v>

1344
00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.143
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When all of this collapse is happening </v>

1345
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.213
<v Speaker 2>and people think that all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's gonna come in and he's going </v>

1346
00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:53.544
<v Speaker 2>to have a completely different set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>priorities and he's going to find all </v>

1347
00:52:55.841 --> 00:52:56.980
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you losing your house,</v>

1348
00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:58.930
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get that guy to that.</v>

1349
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.930
<v Speaker 2>There's 300 million people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1350
00:53:01.931 --> 00:53:02.764
<v Speaker 2>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's not enough money to buy </v>

1351
00:53:04.241 --> 00:53:07.210
<v Speaker 2>everybody's mortgage back and fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not going to happen.</v>

1352
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.810
<v Speaker 2>We voted the guy into office who had no </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1353
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 2>He never had a job.</v>

1354
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.213
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1355
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 1>and so you get what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I understand.</v>

1356
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was excited.</v>

1357
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope and change and all that idea.</v>

1358
00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:18.994
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very powerful message that they </v>

1359
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:21.170
<v Speaker 1>were delivering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a smart,</v>

1360
00:53:21.171 --> 00:53:22.004
<v Speaker 1>smart campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would think that over a period </v>

1361
00:53:24.531 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>of time then what we'd really</v>

1362
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 3>want now is somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1363
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know where to find them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if somebody with that combination of</v>

1364
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>experience and character and a proven </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability,</v>

1365
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 3>a track record to work both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1366
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:37.351
<v Speaker 3>To say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1367
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be able to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to compromise.</v>

1368
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1369
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 3>it's not rocket fucking science to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out some of these problems.</v>

1370
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.243
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the more problems we get and the </v>

1371
00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 3>more negative we get about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems insurmountable.</v>

1372
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 3>But we should be able to find somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this massive country of ours who,</v>

1373
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1374
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 3>can propose some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1375
00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 3>clear-eyed ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1376
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it almost seems like taking a guy</v>

1377
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is analogy that makes sense to me.</v>

1378
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Taking guys never fought before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1379
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:09.383
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make him run for the UFC and now all is </v>

1380
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fight in the UFC.</v>

1381
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.320
<v Speaker 3>What was your fucking experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fridays?</v>

1382
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're welcome.</v>

1383
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1384
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.323
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of a sudden this guy gets his </v>

1385
00:54:19.411 --> 00:54:20.244
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most complicated an impossible </v>

1386
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:22.980
<v Speaker 3>job in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

1387
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:25.140
<v Speaker 3>he's never,</v>

<v Speaker 3>opinions without crapping on them.</v>

1413
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 3>solution that you have to have this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speaker two,</v>

1414
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 3>this is the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be this engaging,</v>

1415
00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:30.210
<v Speaker 3>entertaining individual who I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear talk.</v>

1416
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.673
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear like one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was so great about Obama was how </v>

<v Speaker 3>brilliant orator.</v>

1419
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had me,</v>

1420
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my fucking guy.</v>

1421
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to him talk,</v>

1422
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.780
<v Speaker 3>finally got a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as opposed to Bush,</v>

1423
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.930
<v Speaker 3>who was Bush jr who was an awkward sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a guy.</v>

1424
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:49.973
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w just wasn't that good of a talker and </v>

1425
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would say he's stupid.</v>

1426
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:54.294
<v Speaker 3>He's a dumb guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back and listen to him when he was </v>

1427
00:55:55.741 --> 00:55:57.990
<v Speaker 3>running for governor of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a dumb guy.</v>

1428
00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 3>No you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're tired and overwhelmed.</v>

1429
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:03.120
<v Speaker 3>You don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to those positions.</v>

1430
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by being an idiot.</v>

1431
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:06.200
<v Speaker 3>You made disagree with people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>

1432
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Like I disagree with Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1433
00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't wish him any ill will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1434
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.513
<v Speaker 3>I'm not horrified that he's running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the way it works in this </v>

1435
00:56:13.351 --> 00:56:14.460
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1436
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with the concept of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of socialism or democratic socialism,</v>

1437
00:56:18.601 --> 00:56:19.434
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time I understand and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate the fact that that's what he </v>

1438
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:23.350
<v Speaker 3>believes and he's believed it for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1439
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:24.184
<v Speaker 3>So great.</v>

1440
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1441
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:26.081
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>

1442
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:27.190
<v Speaker 1>we should be trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1443
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.203
<v Speaker 1>to help people that need a leg up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be trying to provide a safety </v>

1444
00:56:30.281 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 1>net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1445
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the people that need it.</v>

1446
00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:32.764
<v Speaker 1>We should be trying to at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting the concept of hard work and </v>

1447
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:38.070
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1448
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong fucking it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with success.</v>

1449
00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:41.621
<v Speaker 1>You work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1450
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monopolies decided they're going to,</v>

1451
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether for all their board</v>
<v Speaker 1>games now,</v>

1452
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.613
<v Speaker 1>but monopoly is going to take away the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper money and give you a bank card </v>

1453
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.433
<v Speaker 1>wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1454
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sets,</v>

1455
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it when I saw Hasbro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which owns when offaly they said,</v>

1456
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:55.624
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to use a bank card for now </v>

1457
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all those kids out there,</v>

1458
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.413
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they don't want them to learn how </v>

1459
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 1>to count paper money because maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unseemly.</v>

1460
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading something into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there obviously,</v>

1461
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but it just did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1462
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.240
<v Speaker 1>It's part and parcel of my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1463
00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 1>they started a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started playing basketball a couple</v>

1464
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.020
<v Speaker 1>seasons ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first league,</v>

1465
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.940
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to keep score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1466
00:57:15.941 --> 00:57:17.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

1467
00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to be a loser.</v>

1468
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't want to put these kids </v>

1469
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:21.270
<v Speaker 1>through stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

1470
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I was playing softball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

1471

<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1472
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Why are you playing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get off the field.</v>

1473
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

1474
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if nobody's going to wink out to feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

1475
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.380
<v Speaker 1>that's part of being a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel bad.</v>

1476
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:33.214
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did fat fucking sucked and then you </v>

1477
00:57:34.511 --> 00:57:35.450
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

1478
00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And those kids know I could ask my six </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old,</v>

1479
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:38.404
<v Speaker 1>I could ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could ask sluggo way into the third </v>

1480
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 1>quarter of a basketball game and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the score?</v>

1481
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And he would know the scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the kids knew the score,</v>

1482
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:48.760
<v Speaker 1>they all all keeping score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're just blowing smoke up,</v>

1483
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents asked and,</v>

1484
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1485
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.173
<v Speaker 1>and consequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we're being clever with our </v>

1486
00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The saying,</v>

1487
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:53.741
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1488
00:57:53.741 --> 00:57:54.630
<v Speaker 1>this will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got,</v>

1489
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how I got off on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my kid walked off the scooter,</v>

1490
00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 1>the oldest one walked off the lacrosse </v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

1491
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and looked at me and he said,</v>

1492
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 1>so how'd I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1493
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:06.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1494
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:07.094
<v Speaker 1>I don't honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want me to be honest or do you </v>

1495
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 1>want me to blow smoke up your ass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1496
00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.393
<v Speaker 1>I'd said it and I didn't realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the parents around and they were </v>

1497
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:14.860
<v Speaker 1>horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got a dressing down.</v>

1498
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1499
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.890
<v Speaker 1>anybody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless him.</v>

1500
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:19.270
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be honest.</v>

1501
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.601
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1502
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:20.434
<v Speaker 1>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't really try as hard as you </v>

1503
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.061
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1504
00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:23.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be the best,</v>

1505
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:24.514
<v Speaker 1>but you got to try really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason that other kid was </v>

1506
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:29.590
<v Speaker 1>with scoring on it was because he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>it more.</v>

1507
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that,</v>

1508
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1509
00:58:31.571 --> 00:58:33.430
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell kids that they're,</v>

1510
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.830
<v Speaker 1>they're not playing their best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can in a nice,</v>

1511
00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive way.</v>

1512
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:38.973
<v Speaker 1>But God forbid we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should hurt any of these little </v>

1513
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 1>snowflakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1514
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.160
<v Speaker 1>By telling him this crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now what do we get?</v>

1515
00:58:45.161 --> 00:58:45.994
<v Speaker 1>All those kids that started years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we started this movement to not </v>

1516
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.624
<v Speaker 1>keep score or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're all at Yale or Amhurst and </v>

1517
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:54.490
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that being contradicted means</v>

1518
00:58:54.491 --> 00:58:55.324
<v Speaker 1>they're being persecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we created this monster </v>

1519
00:58:58.841 --> 00:59:00.840
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now a lot of those people that,</v>

1520
00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1521
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.133
<v Speaker 1>they look and they don't believe because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been told they're victims and </v>

1522
00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 1>the system's rigged and they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked every day.</v>

1523
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.710
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe they can be part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

1524
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 1>So sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at Bernie and they think,</v>

1525
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:11.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about right.</v>

1526
00:59:11.921 --> 00:59:14.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they find likeminded people.</v>

1527
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 1>They band together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all agree on the same thing,</v>

1528
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1529
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 1>they're having a battle right now to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see who can be the most open minded,</v>

1530
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 2>the most liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most accepting.</v>

1531
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:25.123
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the competition is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The competition is being the most left </v>

1532
00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:29.670
<v Speaker 2>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most progressive that they're,</v>

1533
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking each over other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over on progressiveness.</v>

1534
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just asked progressing even the words </v>

1535
00:59:35.501 --> 00:59:36.550
<v Speaker 2>of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even know.</v>

1536
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:36.960
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1537
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.793
<v Speaker 2>it's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

1538
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Madison isn't even a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even have a word for it.</v>

1539
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:40.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progressive.</v>

1540
00:59:40.711 --> 00:59:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Making the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.063
<v Speaker 2>George Bush made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting to a weird porn point </v>

1542
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:46.663
<v Speaker 2>where we're trying to coddle people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not allowing them to experience </v>

1543
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:52.274
<v Speaker 2>defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not allowing them to experience </v>

1544
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:56.240
<v Speaker 2>discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how people grow.</v>

1545
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 2>When if you don't feel uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't learn.</v>

1546
00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.253
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn from every mistake that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever made made me feel like shit </v>

1547
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 2>and that's how I get better at things.</v>

1548
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you learned.</v>

1549
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to feel that way again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do I get better?</v>

1550
01:00:07.641 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>How do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I do this?</v>

1551
01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do it with wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1552
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can get pinned.</v>

1553
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't get pinned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1554
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:15.471
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1555
01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean how the fuck they call up before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get pins and say,</v>

1556
01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey were okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look like you're approaching a pin,</v>

1557
01:00:21.861 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>so let's stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to do it?</v>

1558
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Because I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1559
01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:25.904
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking times I got pinned when I </v>

1560
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>was 14 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still fuck with my head.</v>

1561
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Cut me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carry that.</v>

1562
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>All these years in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights.</v>

1563
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:34.964
<v Speaker 1>Think about some kid pinned me fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school and I'll get angry little </v>

1564
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Schwartz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's father fiber.</v>

1565
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll start doing extra chin ups for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>prick.</v>

1566
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what motivates you,</v>

1567
01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.880
<v Speaker 2>motivates you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1568
01:00:47.881 --> 01:00:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting tapped out in Jujitsu there,</v>

1569
01:00:50.161 --> 01:00:53.460
<v Speaker 2>there are guys that have tapped me out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are literally like,</v>

1570
01:00:53.461 --> 01:00:54.294
<v Speaker 2>when I'm tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will think about them tapping me out </v>

1571
01:00:56.971 --> 01:00:57.804
<v Speaker 2>and I will push further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the only thing that motivates </v>

1572
01:01:00.601 --> 01:01:01.434
<v Speaker 2>you is that fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's one of the only things that's </v>

1573
01:01:03.271 --> 01:01:04.104
<v Speaker 2>really a powerful motivating factor that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone can relate to is that feeling </v>

1574
01:01:07.381 --> 01:01:09.480
<v Speaker 2>of defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that horrible feeling where you go,</v>

1575
01:01:09.481 --> 01:01:10.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get better.</v>

1576
01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I got to get better because someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1577
01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:15.480
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that you're saying that no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's ever better,</v>

1578
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.280
<v Speaker 2>you're perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1579
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get better at stuff.</v>

1580
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>There's always somebody that's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1581
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:22.274
<v Speaker 1>I tell my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because always somebody is going to be </v>

1582
01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:23.924
<v Speaker 1>bigger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always somebody that's going to </v>

1583
01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>be smarter than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

1584
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.490
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is the absolute best you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

1585
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>And you work at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you fall down,</v>

1586
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could lose,</v>

1587
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to learn how to lose weight,</v>

1588
01:01:33.511 --> 01:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>how to lose as an important part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a grownup.</v>

1589
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:36.561
<v Speaker 1>But we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1590
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it again.</v>

1591
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.181
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1592
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the irony of,</v>

1593
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>of kids and expensive colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1594
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>denigrating free speech because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1595
01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it upsets their feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rest the fucking kidding me.</v>

1596
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Progressive aggressors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to look that word up.</v>

1597
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Can we get some help on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

1598
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1599
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.870
<v Speaker 2>the idea of being a progressive is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great idea.</v>

1600
01:01:56.871 --> 01:01:57.704
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want everybody to be equal and you </v>

1601
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:00.554
<v Speaker 2>want equality as far as law and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are treated and how you address </v>

1602
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.950
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one is,</v>

1603
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>no one starts out in a worse spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once that's established,</v>

1604
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.290
<v Speaker 2>And you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's good for everybody.</v>

1606
01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Speaker 2>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for me.</v>

1607
01:02:16.371 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 2>It's given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're competing fairly,</v>

1608
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it generates that competition.</v>

1609
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Generates a lot of good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1610
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it generates ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It generates success.</v>

1611
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.213
<v Speaker 2>If you overcome these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these obstacles that are created by </v>

1612
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand what,</v>

1613
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 2>what needs to be done in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve things.</v>

1614
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:38.730
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1615
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:39.563
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to go through life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to have any </v>

1616
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:42.924
<v Speaker 2>obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never going to have any character </v>

1617
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.324
<v Speaker 2>testing moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not even gonna know what you're </v>

1618
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:47.270
<v Speaker 2>capable.</v>

1619
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started,</v>

1620
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not much of a life lived.</v>

1621
01:02:50.451 --> 01:02:50.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

1622
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:52.270
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not tested and you,</v>

1623
01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>and you're not pushed and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't fail,</v>

1624
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember times when,</v>

1625
01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.473
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1626
01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:00.660
<v Speaker 1>it didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1627
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.461
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1628
01:03:01.461 --> 01:03:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you knew it wasn't going to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1629
01:03:03.651 --> 01:03:04.484
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you just,</v>

1630
01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>it like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made you work harder.</v>

1631
01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:09.050
<v Speaker 1>It made you push harder and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>

1632
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:10.401
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1633
01:03:10.401 --> 01:03:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like interrogation trading.</v>

1634
01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why this popped in my head,</v>

1635
01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:14.684
<v Speaker 1>but it's interrogation training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of interrogation </v>

1636
01:03:16.191 --> 01:03:17.024
<v Speaker 1>training is to break you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you realize you've got a point </v>

1637
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.940
<v Speaker 1>where it's just going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an interrogation training,</v>

1638
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.810
<v Speaker 1>like is it training you to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with being interrogated?</v>

1639
01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are they doing?</v>

1640
01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:28.940
<v Speaker 1>But you also have the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coin,</v>

1641
01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:29.360
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.193
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to navigate and negotiate </v>

1643
01:03:31.551 --> 01:03:33.440
<v Speaker 1>and all the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to call it negotiation.</v>

1644
01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1645
01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but the idea being is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1646
01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:37.651
<v Speaker 1>when you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1647
01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.484
<v Speaker 1>in an interrogation training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is you have to understand that </v>

1648
01:03:41.211 --> 01:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter who you are is you're,</v>

1649
01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.760
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you need is you need to be</v>

1650
01:03:46.761 --> 01:03:48.830
<v Speaker 1>able to pull yourself back together </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1651
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of interrogation trading in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is to show you that hey,</v>

1652
01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>you can go farther than you thought you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

1653
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>but also at some point you're just going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

1654
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I May.</v>

1655
01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:58.071
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1656
01:03:58.071 --> 01:03:59.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on where we're at,</v>

1657
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1658
01:04:02.721 --> 01:04:04.880
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do,</v>

1659
01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>you've got gotta be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're just a puddle of Goo,</v>

1660
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.753
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to pull yourself back </v>

1661
01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:10.850
<v Speaker 1>together again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bit like that failure.</v>

1662
01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure teaches success.</v>

1663
01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Failure drives success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless,</v>

1664
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we teach waning a culture of just</v>

1665
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.260
<v Speaker 1>fucking mediocrity and what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1666
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.123
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a happy sign.</v>

1668
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We Egan,</v>

1669
01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't nerf the world.</v>

1670
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.350
<v Speaker 2>You have to learn the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking up.</v>

1671
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:32.750
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't learn the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fucking up,</v>

1672
01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.613
<v Speaker 2>you never understand what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that work harder than </v>

1673
01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:37.694
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that are smarter than </v>

1674
01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're people that want it more.</v>

1675
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.030
<v Speaker 2>There are people that are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambitious.</v>

1676
01:04:41.031 --> 01:04:43.850
<v Speaker 2>There are people that are more intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more focused and more disciplined.</v>

1677
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And if there are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then somehow or another,</v>

1678
01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:48.740
<v Speaker 2>we're all perfect and equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the case.</v>

1679
01:04:48.741 --> 01:04:50.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1680
01:04:50.271 --> 01:04:52.580
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this competition fuels everything.</v>

1681
01:04:52.581 --> 01:04:53.414
<v Speaker 2>We have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1682
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.750
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every year cars get faster.</v>

1683
01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.643
<v Speaker 2>Why do they get faster?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're fucking competing </v>

1684
01:04:58.641 --> 01:05:01.760
<v Speaker 2>against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chevy is competing against this company.</v>

1685
01:05:01.761 --> 01:05:02.594
<v Speaker 2>They're competing against forward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all trying to make a car that </v>

1686
01:05:04.431 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>goes zero to 60 and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a second night,</v>

1687
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.480
<v Speaker 2>and every fucking year they get closer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

1688
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:09.523
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one reason for that and it's </v>

1689
01:05:11.721 --> 01:05:15.320
<v Speaker 2>because there's other cars out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing a better job there.</v>

1690
01:05:15.321 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Skid pad and numbers are getting higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1691
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Quarter mile numbers are getting lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting faster,</v>

1692
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 2>they're handled better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting safer.</v>

1693
01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 2>All they're doing this because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

1694
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's the only thing that fuels </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>

1695
01:05:27.581 --> 01:05:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Competition fuels innovation and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire that everybody has to,</v>

1696
01:05:31.421 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to get the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest shit.</v>

1697
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.391
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1698
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:35.224
<v Speaker 2>and that's where they talked about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about phones where </v>

1699
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 2>they're told what it doesn't matter what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1700
01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:38.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everything.</v>

1701
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Human beings look whilst they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic records,</v>

1702
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.573
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is everybody trying to break </v>

1703
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>records?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the UFC we're constantly going</v>

1704
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>over statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guys,</v>

1705
01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 2>one more fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guys landed more significant blows.</v>

1706
01:05:51.011 --> 01:05:53.280
<v Speaker 2>This guys landed more submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1707
01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:53.950
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1708
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you're competing.</v>

1709
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 2>This is why people like watching things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the UFC is because it's contrary to</v>

1710
01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:00.724
<v Speaker 2>this participation shit that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a participation trophy bullshit </v>

1711
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.820
<v Speaker 2>that's going on with little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1712
01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go back to that same point,</v>

1713
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.464
<v Speaker 2>which is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not fooling any of them in a </v>

1714
01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a period of time,</v>

1715
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 2>we create a bad precedent and a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>

1716
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.620
<v Speaker 2>But at that moment that kids know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell this score is,</v>

1717
01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:19.220
<v Speaker 2>they know what the hell is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

1718
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they know that it's,</v>

1719
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:23.110
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit when you tell them they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful every time that they're not,</v>

1720
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I told my kid,</v>

1721
01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:25.054
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time he finished a practice or a </v>

1722
01:06:25.601 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 2>sports game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1723
01:06:26.831 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did great.</v>

1724
01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

1725
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.253
<v Speaker 2>it means fuck all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means nothing to them at a certain </v>

1726
01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:31.570
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1727
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And then he loses when he loses respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he looses also motivation.</v>

1728
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:35.111
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1729
01:06:35.111 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm great all the time,</v>

1730
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:36.911
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1731
01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:37.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better thing to tell them is you know </v>

1732
01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 2>this horrible feeling that you've got in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stomach right now.</v>

1733
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Use that as fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuel yourself with the fuck ups.</v>

1734
01:06:45.731 --> 01:06:46.564
<v Speaker 2>Fuel yourself with the failures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean we love you less </v>

1735
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.493
<v Speaker 2>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your parents and your friends are going </v>

1736
01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:54.190
<v Speaker 2>to love you no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1737
01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:55.024
<v Speaker 2>Randy coture said this to me once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about fighters and how </v>

1738
01:06:57.941 --> 01:06:58.774
<v Speaker 2>he talks to fighters that he's training </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said the most important thing is </v>

1739
01:07:02.261 --> 01:07:03.094
<v Speaker 2>you can't be afraid to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen at one point in </v>

1740
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:07.900
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you keep fighting,</v>

1741
01:07:07.901 --> 01:07:11.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody loses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to think to yourself what,</v>

1742
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:12.790
<v Speaker 2>what is important in life?</v>

1743
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Your family loving you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're friends loving you,</v>

1744
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>they're still going to love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still you.</v>

1745
01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:17.244
<v Speaker 2>It's still going to be all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those pieces are going to be in </v>

1746
01:07:18.791 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you lose except that,</v>

1747
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 2>and then go out there and do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as long as you've done your best,</v>

1748
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you can keep your chin up and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand that whatever failure</v>

1749
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 2>that you've experienced there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever mistake,</v>

1750
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:34.563
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a mathematical problem </v>

1751
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:38.560
<v Speaker 2>you've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can't throw a one,</v>

1752
01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:41.350
<v Speaker 2>two and then drop your left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get hit with a counter right now.</v>

1753
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:42.184
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't get hit with that </v>

1754
01:07:43.301 --> 01:07:44.440
<v Speaker 2>counter right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd never know.</v>

1755
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 2>If you go through life just throwing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1756
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>two and winning every time you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the perfect game plan,</v>

1757
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.180
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1758
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:52.930
<v Speaker 2>you teach that to someone else and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person realizes,</v>

1759
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this game plan's no good.</v>

1760
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.070
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep your fucking hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't keep your hands up,</v>

1761
01:07:57.071 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 2>you get hit these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1762
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the reasons why I keep going</v>

1763
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.344
<v Speaker 2>back to fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the reasons why people </v>

1764
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:05.290
<v Speaker 2>like fighting cause it's so absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1765
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to decisions because decisions can</v>

1766
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 2>be fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than decisions,</v>

1767
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.090
<v Speaker 2>when someone hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hit you and they don't hit.</v>

1768
01:08:13.091 --> 01:08:15.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very clear.</v>

1769
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>It's very decisive</v>

1770
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1771
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no fucking about,</v>

1772
01:08:19.671 --> 01:08:20.121
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1773
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:20.954
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is as opposed to so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rest of the world or what you're </v>

1774
01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:25.590
<v Speaker 1>trying to find examples of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>words</v>

1775
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.730
<v Speaker 2>gray and murky and I don't know if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as a score of all goes in the net.</v>

1776
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.770
<v Speaker 2>It goes in the net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1777
01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 2>It goes in or it doesn't go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to raise kids to this,</v>

1778
01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.400
<v Speaker 2>to have this foggy concept in their head</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't matter.</v>

1779
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1780
01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:44.550
<v Speaker 2>it does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fucking matters a lot.</v>

1781
01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:45.384
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what does,</v>

1782
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:48.000
<v Speaker 2>here's what doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents are going to love you.</v>

1783
01:08:48.001 --> 01:08:48.834
<v Speaker 2>Your friends going to love you if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents don't love you because you </v>

1784
01:08:50.851 --> 01:08:53.310
<v Speaker 2>didn't drop a ball in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Dad's a piece of shit.</v>

1785
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's something we all need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

1786
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are there we all experienced </v>

1787
01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:01.050
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1788
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:01.861
<v Speaker 2>we've all seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1789
01:09:01.861 --> 01:09:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him on the side and one of my,</v>

1790
01:09:03.570 --> 01:09:04.403
<v Speaker 2>my kid was going to soccer practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching his dad screaming his </v>

1791
01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>daughter and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it,</v>

1792
01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

1793

<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's go hustle.</v>

1794
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.713
<v Speaker 2>Let's go hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like all the fucking sports </v>

1795
01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.170
<v Speaker 2>terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get that one.</v>

1796
01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>We can get need to get that one back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta get that one line.</v>

1797
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're a parent and you're living </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life through your kids,</v>

1798
01:09:21.391 --> 01:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>sporting exploits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1799
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:24.303
<v Speaker 1>go fucking do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Encourage them and give them what they </v>

1800
01:09:26.851 --> 01:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>need to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't,</v>

1801
01:09:28.561 --> 01:09:32.160
<v Speaker 1>don't value yourself through what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are doing and sports.</v>

1802
01:09:32.161 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many parents out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did that.</v>

1803
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I coached for a while.</v>

1804
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter,</v>

1805
01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 1>who's now in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she played a lot of softball.</v>

1806
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I was coaching at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1807
01:09:43.141 --> 01:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>before she got to the point where I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to offer.</v>

1808
01:09:45.271 --> 01:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to actually get coaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knew what they were doing.</v>

1809
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>But I remember at one point there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one dad who was just like,</v>

1810
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:50.993
<v Speaker 1>he was just a complete douche and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>always a Douche and he'd just show up </v>

1811
01:09:53.611 --> 01:09:54.444
<v Speaker 1>and he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd berate his kid and his kid was </v>

1812
01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:56.840
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

1813
01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:57.723
<v Speaker 1>She was a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one time she actually walked up to </v>

1814
01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:02.400
<v Speaker 1>me and she was as she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell she wanted to cry,</v>

1815
01:10:02.401 --> 01:10:03.234
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't choose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a great kid and she apologized </v>

1816
01:10:05.821 --> 01:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>for her dad's behavior in the dugout </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the dad,</v>

1817
01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>she's like leaning over the fence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

1818
01:10:10.261 --> 01:10:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And how long was he at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was 14 I guess.</v>

1819
01:10:14.431 --> 01:10:15.151
<v Speaker 1>And it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

1820
01:10:15.151 --> 01:10:16.620
<v Speaker 1>look honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not your deal.</v>

1821
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not your fault.</v>

1822
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>And then I had to go over and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1823
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:21.103
<v Speaker 1>you have fucking Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said that to him and he was eight </v>

1824
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>and I thought he was going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take my head off,</v>

1825
01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:25.650
<v Speaker 1>but he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a big boy,</v>

1826
01:10:25.651 --> 01:10:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't argue with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he knew deep down he knew.</v>

1827
01:10:28.981 --> 01:10:29.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1828
01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:30.610
<v Speaker 1>the guys right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a Douche.</v>

1829
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.351
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to leave.</v>

1830
01:10:31.351 --> 01:10:32.184
<v Speaker 1>You can't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for a kid to apologize for their </v>

1831
01:10:34.951 --> 01:10:36.170
<v Speaker 1>parent's behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1832
01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it,</v>

1833
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>you see it fairly often.</v>

1834
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.933
<v Speaker 2>Parents get fucking heated up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a crazy story about a dad who </v>

1835
01:10:40.981 --> 01:10:45.060
<v Speaker 2>killed a another dad in a hockey fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1836
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that the kids were playing,</v>

1837
01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:48.024
<v Speaker 2>the kids apparently had got into it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice and this fucking big giant guy </v>

1838
01:10:51.991 --> 01:10:52.824
<v Speaker 2>beat a guy to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the guy to death in front of his </v>

1839
01:10:55.921 --> 01:10:56.620
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1840
01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.520
<v Speaker 1>There was another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1841
01:10:57.521 --> 01:10:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>softball also.</v>

1842
01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:00.930
<v Speaker 1>It's girl's softball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1843
01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:01.873
<v Speaker 1>they get very competitive,</v>

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.773
<v Speaker 1>The picked up a bat and went after him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hit him in the head with a bat and </v>

1849
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:17.720
<v Speaker 1>put them in the hospital.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1851
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>He hit the coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1853
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

1854
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1855
01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause kid wasn't getting enough light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1856
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.381
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1857
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter needs more plain</v>

1858
01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:27.523
<v Speaker 2>competition then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people are afraid of with </v>

1859
01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:30.324
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're coming up with this </v>

1860
01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:32.004
<v Speaker 2>idea of participation trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are moving </v>

1861
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:39.210
<v Speaker 2>away or trying to move away from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want a kinder,</v>

1862
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 2>gentler world and they think that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to do it.</v>

1863
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:43.311
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm,</v>

1864
01:11:43.311 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to be out in Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

1865
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:47.270
<v Speaker 1>we don't necessarily go for the kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentler world outside.</v>

1866
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:48.530
<v Speaker 1>It's too fucking cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

1867
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I can call you got coyotes and wolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bears and shit that I got to eat you</v>

1868
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

1869
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:54.564
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much just sort of pull your </v>

1870
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:56.880
<v Speaker 1>boots up and just get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1871
01:11:56.881 --> 01:11:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1872
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 1>culture out there and it's a great place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to raise,</v>

1873
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.880
<v Speaker 1>raise kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1874
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I couldn't be happier because it's,</v>

1875
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:07.170
<v Speaker 1>the outdoor activities are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

1876
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:08.004
<v Speaker 1>The climbing and the rafting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible skiing is obviously great </v>

1877
01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:13.320
<v Speaker 1>fishing and hunting is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1878
01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:14.810
<v Speaker 1>I sound like the Chamber of Commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1879
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.410
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a beautiful place.</v>

1880
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who has a house in Coeur</v>

1881
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 1>d'alene and they send me pictures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>

1882
01:12:21.121 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1883
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real place.</v>

1884
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>You can fly up to spokane and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>easiest way to get to quote Atlanta.</v>

1885
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drive beds.</v>

1886
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's about 40 minutes or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it from spokane.</v>

1887
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:30.774
<v Speaker 1>But if you drive from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fly into boise and you drive up </v>

1888
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:34.740
<v Speaker 1>to core Delaney to take you about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>century and a half,</v>

1889
01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>it takes a while cause it's got to big </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking state.</v>

1890
01:12:36.851 --> 01:12:37.684
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:38.630
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1892
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:39.541
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1893
01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:40.374
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because that Wyoming </v>

1894
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole part of the country or the,</v>

1895
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just still a little bit different.</v>

1896
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:49.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the urban centers are all starting to </v>

1897
01:12:51.811 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of unify it and become a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

1898
01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.100
<v Speaker 1>But I think when people,</v>

1899
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.003
<v Speaker 2>we'll have to deal with nature when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with winter and storms </v>

1900
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:04.020
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just the reality of being in nature.</v>

1901
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.273
<v Speaker 2>It humbles you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also hardens you a little bit to </v>

1902
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:08.634
<v Speaker 2>the realities of changing climates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the realities of just wild life and all </v>

1903
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:18.000
<v Speaker 2>the dangers and all the wonderful things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that come from nature</v>

1904
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:19.011
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>

1905
01:13:19.011 --> 01:13:19.844
<v Speaker 1>And the expansiveness of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of humbles you a little bit </v>

1906
01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:23.240
<v Speaker 1>and you can you drive up what got we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

1907
01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.850
<v Speaker 1>we're very fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not that far from yellowstone.</v>

1908
01:13:25.851 --> 01:13:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean not far being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1909
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:30.610
<v Speaker 1>a handful of hours drive and you go off </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a place and if people haven't,</v>

1910
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.090
<v Speaker 1>their listening haven't been to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellowstone,</v>

1911
01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:32.870
<v Speaker 1>good guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1912
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:35.810
<v Speaker 1>do yourself a favor and go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go during a high tourist season.</v>

1913
01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:38.810
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to see something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just is stunning,</v>

1914
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:41.630
<v Speaker 1>spend a few days up in yellowstone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does,</v>

1915
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.680
<v Speaker 1>it puts you back a little bit and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you realize a how,</v>

1916
01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.210
<v Speaker 1>how amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1917
01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:48.320
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this planet is b,</v>

1918
01:13:48.321 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>how incredible this country is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

1919
01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:54.080
<v Speaker 1>and it also kind of puts your priorities</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more in shape.</v>

1920
01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.900
<v Speaker 1>We try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we attract a bunch of grizzlies up there</v>

1921
01:13:56.901 --> 01:13:58.490
<v Speaker 1>for a travel channel show.</v>

1922
01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And there were times when you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd forget what you were doing.</v>

1923
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:04.520
<v Speaker 1>You just stand there and just stare out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there at the,</v>

1924
01:14:04.521 --> 01:14:06.410
<v Speaker 1>at the scenery and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1925
01:14:06.411 --> 01:14:07.244
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it was a travel channel </v>

1926
01:14:08.001 --> 01:14:09.170
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to be co hosting and,</v>

1927
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.850
<v Speaker 1>and yet I was just gobsmacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the,</v>

1928
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not good for a cohost.</v>

1929
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you're supposed to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe what you're seeing.</v>

1930
01:14:15.191 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And I would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1931
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

1932
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:18.064
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that and say that I </v>

1933
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>allowed to travel journal and beep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1934
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they wanted,</v>

1935
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.680
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want that impression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1936
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1937
01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:29.910
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting out,</v>

1938
01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.250
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing that environment,</v>

1939
01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:36.480
<v Speaker 2>seeing the wild bison and buffalo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves and all the,</v>

1940
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.100
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landscape</v>

1941
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.410
<v Speaker 1>and you learn also where your food comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1942
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of it too.</v>

1943
01:14:41.731 --> 01:14:42.770
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tough,</v>

1944
01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:44.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1945
01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:45.690
<v Speaker 1>they know where their food comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>

1946
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:48.030
<v Speaker 1>you know what it takes to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

1947
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.710
<v Speaker 1>They know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what fishing's all about.</v>

1948
01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.290
<v Speaker 1>They understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You develop a respect for it.</v>

1949
01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.480
<v Speaker 1>You understand that the world's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>

1950
01:14:54.810 --> 01:14:55.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1951
01:14:55.471 --> 01:14:57.870
<v Speaker 1>all those precious uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals out,</v>

1952
01:14:57.871 --> 01:14:59.630
<v Speaker 1>those bison are going to get a baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>bison.</v>

1953
01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I watched the baby buys and get dragged </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and you think,</v>

1954
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was with somebody who was on the,</v>

1955
01:15:03.721 --> 01:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>on the production team that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we should enter,</v>

1956
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.293
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1957
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:08.183
<v Speaker 1>get in there and help that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it getting dragged down by </v>

1958
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.500
<v Speaker 1>getting dragged down by walls and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>

1959
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:13.343
<v Speaker 1>you guys were there while this was how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've actually yellowstone's did a </v>

1960
01:15:15.901 --> 01:15:16.734
<v Speaker 1>wonderful job of bringing back a number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things and there it says a fairly </v>

1961
01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.020
<v Speaker 1>active wolf population up there.</v>

1962
01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.600
<v Speaker 1>The bears are looking great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grizzlies and everything and says,</v>

1963
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.740
<v Speaker 1>but the point being is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1964
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.760
<v Speaker 1>if you grow up out there I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you spend a lot of time out there,</v>

1965
01:15:29.761 --> 01:15:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you want to stand that yet life isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't fair.</v>

1966
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.433
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we just keep telling our kids </v>

1967
01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:40.170
<v Speaker 1>that life is fair and everybody gets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be equal and it's not the way it works.</v>

1968
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And even in the human species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the way it works.</v>

1969
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is always going to be harder,</v>

1970
01:15:45.151 --> 01:15:46.110
<v Speaker 1>tougher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>

1971
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:49.770
<v Speaker 1>more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing.</v>

1972
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Well it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1973
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you less of a person.</v>

1974
01:15:54.721 --> 01:15:59.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you love the less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think people value there.</v>

1975
01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.670
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem when people think</v>

1976
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:06.030
<v Speaker 2>that winning is the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause this is not the only thing,</v>

1977
01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:06.893
<v Speaker 2>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant spectrum of things that </v>

1978
01:16:10.111 --> 01:16:12.300
<v Speaker 2>we value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We value comradery,</v>

1979
01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.134
<v Speaker 2>we value friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We value intelligence in a sense of </v>

1980
01:16:16.261 --> 01:16:17.094
<v Speaker 2>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone who's interesting and </v>

1981
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.260
<v Speaker 2>fascinating to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1982
01:16:21.261 --> 01:16:26.070
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things that people value</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a human being that being the best</v>

1983
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:29.370
<v Speaker 2>at one thing that you compete in is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing in life.</v>

1984
01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.613
<v Speaker 2>And this is a real problem with athletes</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they retire because all of their </v>

1985
01:16:33.601 --> 01:16:34.434
<v Speaker 2>sense of self worth a lot of times is </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrapped up in competition and they have </v>

1986
01:16:39.691 --> 01:16:44.040
<v Speaker 2>been obsessed with greatness and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards they feel this like hollow,</v>

1987
01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:46.530
<v Speaker 2>sad life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big issue with fighters.</v>

1988
01:16:46.531 --> 01:16:48.710
<v Speaker 2>A gigantic issue with fighters </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] fine.</v>

1989
01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Something that that takes that over </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1990
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:54.120
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they turned to drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>

1991
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:54.963
<v Speaker 2>the high of competing is so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so many classic situations were </v>

1992
01:16:59.901 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 2>great fighters turned to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lewis,</v>

1993
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sonny Liston,</v>

1994
01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go down the line,</v>

1995
01:17:05.811 --> 01:17:06.591
<v Speaker 2>Aaron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior,</v>

1996
01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of great fighters who </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned to drugs later in their life</v>

1997
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:12.890
<v Speaker 3>because they just didn't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck to do.</v>

1998
01:17:12.891 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1999
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 3>You're always looking for something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to fill that void,</v>

2000
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:16.634
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one of my brothers is a flew f </v>

2001
01:17:18.741 --> 01:17:20.170
<v Speaker 3>four is in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2002
01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:21.300
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of tours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2003
01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.300
<v Speaker 3>and he was one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

2004
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:24.134
<v Speaker 3>that was it guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Duval's character and apocalypse </v>

2005
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.820
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just one of those guys that,</v>

2006
01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he appreciated the moment.</v>

2007
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:36.163
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he appreciated the rush that he was </v>

2008
01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 3>getting smell flying home in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

2009
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2010
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:41.460
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2011
01:17:41.461 --> 01:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>and by the point being is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2012
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 3>he came back and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2013
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:44.991
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2014
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:45.824
<v Speaker 3>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ended up being a senior pilot of the </v>

2015
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 3>commercial airline and he's never had an</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

2016
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:50.384
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can always tell that when you sit </v>

2017
01:17:52.221 --> 01:17:53.960
<v Speaker 3>down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over over some drinks,</v>

2018
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always that that was,</v>

2019
01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:57.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that moment in time,</v>

2020
01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:58.574
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was that event or that was that </v>

2021
01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:03.800
<v Speaker 3>activity that I don't know what you ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill that again.</v>

2022
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 3>You don't ever get to that point again </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's you're,</v>

2023
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:08.110
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing that same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rush or that,</v>

2024
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.111
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2025
01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:09.944
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that challenge when you get addicted to </v>

2026
01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:15.710
<v Speaker 3>hitting 11 when everybody else is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting six on a good day,</v>

2027
01:18:15.711 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 3>a crazy day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today I got up to six,</v>

2028
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if your truck with Dell,</v>

2029
01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:21.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2030
01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you do today?</v>

2031
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:25.670
<v Speaker 3>You did a fucking mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ran a mile.</v>

2032
01:18:25.671 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 3>You fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2033
01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:29.043
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of danger and reward of </v>

2034
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 3>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

2035
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:35.774
<v Speaker 3>these are all there so intense to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's been involved in like </v>

2036
01:18:40.131 --> 01:18:43.160
<v Speaker 3>really heavy competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see with fighters all the time,</v>

2037
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:46.310
<v Speaker 3>this very reluctant decision that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2038
01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:49.730
<v Speaker 3>they're very reluctant to step away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the game when they've been knocked out a</v>

2039
01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:50.564
<v Speaker 3>bunch of times and they start to lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>their chin and they start to experience </v>

2040
01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:54.794
<v Speaker 3>some cognitive issues and it's so hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>for them and they need someone to step </v>

2041
01:18:58.641 --> 01:19:00.140
<v Speaker 3>in and grab them and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to me,</v>

2042
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:02.420
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't get out now,</v>

2043
01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:05.690
<v Speaker 3>it's going to get real ugly in the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years.</v>

2044
01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:06.523
<v Speaker 3>And you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could reach a point where you're </v>

2045
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:10.700
<v Speaker 3>never going to bounce back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a few more knockouts,</v>

2046
01:19:10.701 --> 01:19:11.534
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four more knockouts and you might be </v>

2047
01:19:12.561 --> 01:19:13.394
<v Speaker 3>fucked for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we see it now with a lot of NFL </v>

2048
01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 3>players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2049
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 3>we've definitely seen it with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

2050
01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

2051
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:20.264
<v Speaker 3>look at the greatest of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest boxer of all time is a </v>

2052
01:19:23.151 --> 01:19:23.984
<v Speaker 3>physical wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed Ali is in the worst shape of </v>

2053
01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:29.853
<v Speaker 3>like literally any public figure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has ever been so graceful and beautiful </v>

2054
01:19:34.281 --> 01:19:35.114
<v Speaker 3>and as Moose Mints and the weight talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so charismatic and now you look at </v>

2055
01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:41.300
<v Speaker 3>him and he cannot talk at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cannot walk.</v>

2056
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.450
<v Speaker 3>That is a direct consequence of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you said,</v>

2057
01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:46.220
<v Speaker 3>look at the NFL and look at what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding now.</v>

2058
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2059
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.850
<v Speaker 3>that that's filtered down to the youth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2060
01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a full contact football </v>
<v Speaker 3>at an early age.</v>

2061
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:53.870
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good move.</v>

2062
01:19:53.871 --> 01:19:54.704
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of parents are just refusing to </v>

2063
01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 3>have their kid play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play football.</v>

2064
01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that you know,</v>

2065
01:20:00.471 --> 01:20:01.030
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

2066
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:02.960
<v Speaker 3>they would let their kids fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll let their kids fight,</v>

2067
01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:05.130
<v Speaker 3>but they won't let the kids get involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2068
01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:06.560
<v Speaker 3>in football because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2069
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>if you fight and you get</v>

2070
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.933
<v Speaker 2>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you and one guy and you might get </v>

2071
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 2>hit and you're probably going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>

2072
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:13.853
<v Speaker 2>But if you do your diligence and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on your technique and you </v>

2073
01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:16.824
<v Speaker 2>understand footwork and you understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules of engagement and you </v>

2074
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:20.154
<v Speaker 2>understand like correct strategy as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as movement and do all your work in the </v>

2075
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:26.940
<v Speaker 2>gym and understand how to defense number</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2076
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:28.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the number one most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2077
01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.053
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to mitigate a lot of that </v>

2078
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:32.370
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to the,</v>

2079
01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:35.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fighters that walk away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the game and they're okay.</v>

2080
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>It is possible to do look at Floyd </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather.</v>

2081
01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking guys 49 and,</v>

2082
01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:41.860
<v Speaker 2>oh and he's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not like them but Shitty,</v>

2083
01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get hit.</v>

2084
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.633
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the difference between him and a </v>

2085
01:20:47.731 --> 01:20:48.564
<v Speaker 2>guy who decides to bite down on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouthpiece and just slug it out and to </v>

2086
01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:52.584
<v Speaker 2>see whose last man standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant difference in his </v>

2087
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:56.634
<v Speaker 2>strategy and the consequences of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy versus a guy who just likes to </v>

2088
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:00.774
<v Speaker 2>put on a show for the fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that guy is going to be in a </v>

2089
01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:03.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking wheelchair when he's older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:07.310
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day I had to deal with the was</v>

2091
01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:08.163
<v Speaker 1>sluggo the middle boy who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you want him cause he's been a </v>

2092
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.823
<v Speaker 1>Johnson to play football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then he found out that the only </v>

2093
01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 1>league available was flag football and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked at me,</v>

2094
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.060
<v Speaker 1>he's not that he's what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's almost seven.</v>

2095
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the point that was,</v>

2096
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 1>that was his comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>

2097
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:22.051
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well honey,</v>

2098
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the point is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2099
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 1>you raised an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2100
01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just focus on on other sports,</v>

2101
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:29.004
<v Speaker 1>get them involved in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I always tell someone who's </v>

2102
01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.310
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got it</v>

2103
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 2>kid and they want to get their kid in </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>

2104
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I got involved in martial arts at an </v>
<v Speaker 2>early age,</v>

2105
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.553
<v Speaker 2>but I got involved in striking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was because there was no Jujitsu </v>

2106
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:42.150
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I,</v>

2107
01:21:42.151 --> 01:21:45.660
<v Speaker 2>if I had a child that was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>competing,</v>

2108
01:21:45.661 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I would get them involved in Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might get your arm broken,</v>

2109
01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking put you in a cast.</v>

2110
01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:52.430
<v Speaker 2>He'll heal up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn to tap.</v>

2111
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Next time you know you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

2112
01:21:53.621 --> 01:21:55.780
<v Speaker 1>you'll get John Broken falling out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

2113
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:58.750
<v Speaker 1>When did you start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you started?</v>

2114
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2115
01:21:59.841 --> 01:22:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I started my first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took karate when I was 14 but I really</v>

2116
01:22:04.251 --> 01:22:05.084
<v Speaker 2>got serious when I was 15 I took it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little Kung Fu when I was younger than </v>

2117
01:22:07.701 --> 01:22:08.534
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't get serious until I was a </v>

2118
01:22:09.951 --> 01:22:10.784
<v Speaker 2>soft my right before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from the summer of my right before </v>

2119
01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:17.620
<v Speaker 2>when freshmen to sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so forth.</v>

2120
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.473
<v Speaker 2>There's something team during that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there some reason why you got </v>

2121
01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.600
<v Speaker 2>interested or why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been interested because I was small</v>

2122
01:22:23.601 --> 01:22:25.880
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't want to get picked on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was definitely that.</v>

2123
01:22:25.881 --> 01:22:28.880
<v Speaker 2>But the big thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just straight luck.</v>

2124
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I was a baseball fan and went to a red </v>
<v Speaker 2>sox game at Fenway Park.</v>

2125
01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I was walking home and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was walking home,</v>

2126
01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.310
<v Speaker 2>me and a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to the,</v>

2127
01:22:37.311 --> 01:22:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the t,</v>

2128
01:22:38.211 --> 01:22:39.044
<v Speaker 2>the public transport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a dry line cause it was the </v>

2129
01:22:40.731 --> 01:22:42.410
<v Speaker 2>baseball game we could let out.</v>

2130
01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.753
<v Speaker 2>So we were walked by this taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and I walked upstairs and it was </v>

2131
01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:52.310
<v Speaker 2>as long staircase up to the Jay Hahn Kim</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taekwondo Institute.</v>

2132
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:55.190
<v Speaker 2>And as I was walking up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by luck,</v>

2133
01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:59.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy named John Lee who was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>national taekwondo champion,</v>

2134
01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:00.224
<v Speaker 2>national light heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was training for the World Cup </v>

2135
01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 2>and he was in just peak for the World </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cup.</v>

2136
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I got up to the top of stairs,</v>

2137
01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard this sound,</v>

2138
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:13.870
<v Speaker 2>this lump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's like chink,</v>

2139
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 2>like these chains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chains,</v>

2140
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:18.250
<v Speaker 2>like shake womp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chink.</v>

2141
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that sound?</v>

2142
01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.094
<v Speaker 2>And as I got to the top of the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this era you had to take off </v>

2143
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.720
<v Speaker 2>your shoes and you had to walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could watch these guys train.</v>

2144
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:31.200
<v Speaker 2>And John Lee was kicking the bag and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was doing this spinning back kick on the</v>

2145
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:36.781
<v Speaker 2>bag and bending this 100 pound bag in </v>
<v Speaker 2>half and sending it flying.</v>

2146
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:40.280
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to learn to do that.</v>

2147
01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe anybody could hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody that hard.</v>

2148
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen anything like that in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2149
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Did jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the guy that you were with the buddy</v>

2150
01:23:47.611 --> 01:23:48.990
<v Speaker 1>that you were with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he go up there too?</v>

2151
01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:50.870
<v Speaker 1>And he quit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started for a little,</v>

2152
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:52.230
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a buddy of mine,</v>

2153
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.940
<v Speaker 2>still a buddy of mine actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still friends.</v>

2154
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W we watched it together and uh,</v>

2155
01:23:58.230 --> 01:24:00.780

2168
01:24:29.551 --> 01:24:30.810

2169
01:24:30.811 --> 01:24:31.890
<v Speaker 2>It could have been a children's class.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 1>coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's supposed to be that way,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you might be right.</v>

2184
01:24:58.641 --> 01:25:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Or you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might just be guessing.</v>

2185
01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.094
<v Speaker 2>But to me it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gigantic moment and decision in my </v>

2186
01:25:05.211 --> 01:25:06.044
<v Speaker 2>life to go up those stairs and to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy doing that changed my whole </v>

2187
01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:09.584
<v Speaker 2>life because that became my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from 15 to 21 that's what I did </v>

2188
01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.100
<v Speaker 2>every day in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2189
01:25:16.101 --> 01:25:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I trained every day</v>

2190
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:18.533
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you got to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna find whatever's going to </v>

2191
01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:20.454
<v Speaker 1>spark it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see parents do that all the time </v>

2192
01:25:22.081 --> 01:25:22.914
<v Speaker 1>with their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2193
01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him a kid to be a baseball player</v>

2194
01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and they just push and push and push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying,</v>

2195
01:25:27.541 --> 01:25:28.041
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

2196
01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:28.874
<v Speaker 1>I want to expose these kids to various </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and see if they spark the find </v>

2197
01:25:32.111 --> 01:25:33.630
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the thing.</v>

2198
01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And because it's got to be part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be internal.</v>

2199
01:25:36.571 --> 01:25:37.620
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2200
01:25:37.621 --> 01:25:39.780
<v Speaker 1>you can for a period of time and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

2201
01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:40.561
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2202
01:25:40.561 --> 01:25:41.394
<v Speaker 1>it's only gonna go so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you could find that thing like </v>

2203
01:25:42.841 --> 01:25:43.674
<v Speaker 1>you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that sparks something and the kid </v>

2204
01:25:45.571 --> 01:25:46.381
<v Speaker 1>realizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2205
01:25:46.381 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I could become really good at this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in.</v>

2206
01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it and it sets me apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me different.</v>

2207
01:25:51.031 --> 01:25:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It makes me special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God bless,</v>

2208
01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:54.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>

2209
01:25:54.091 --> 01:25:55.920
<v Speaker 1>if you can do that with your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're halfway home.</v>

2210
01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know if I could be good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because I didn't have any talent.</v>

2211
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't like I walked up there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden I was the right,</v>

2212
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked up there,</v>

2213
01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2214
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:06.884
<v Speaker 2>I was surrounded by black belts who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking people's heads off and I was </v>

2215
01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

2216
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.290
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was,</v>

2217
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 2>it was so terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was also in a good way.</v>

2218
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 2>It was very much like a cult because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in a good way.</v>

2219
01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Like they didn't take advantage of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you had to bow.</v>

2220
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.883
<v Speaker 2>You had to say yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some intense discipline and </v>

2221
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:31.790
<v Speaker 2>you got to see some intense consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fucking up.</v>

2222
01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Cause I got to see a lot of guys get </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out.</v>

2223
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:34.911
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2224
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:35.744
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of guys get knocked out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tournaments and start guys getting </v>

2225
01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:42.140
<v Speaker 2>knocked out in practice and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>also the belt system.</v>

2226
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:43.123
<v Speaker 2>The belt system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in martial arts is very </v>

2227
01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:46.874
<v Speaker 2>important for kids because like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>started out as a white belt and you get </v>

2228
01:26:49.851 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that blue belt like you tie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like here's a perfect example,</v>

2229
01:26:52.521 --> 01:26:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Bourdain's 58 fucking years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got his blue belt and he told me</v>

2230
01:26:56.781 --> 01:26:58.400
<v Speaker 2>it was the happiest he's ever been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

2231
01:26:58.770 --> 01:26:59.603
<v Speaker 2>More,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more important than anything other than </v>

2232
01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:02.870
<v Speaker 2>the birth of his child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2233
01:27:02.871 --> 01:27:04.940
<v Speaker 2>to him it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking did it.</v>

2234
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And here's a guy who like used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin addict,</v>

2235
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.940
<v Speaker 2>smoked cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drinking all the time,</v>

2236
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:15.970
<v Speaker 2>was at a terrible lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His wife who's obsessed with Jujitsu got</v>

2237
01:27:16.161 --> 01:27:16.994
<v Speaker 2>him to take a Jujitsu class and then all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden for whatever reason that </v>

2238
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>switch goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at them,</v>

2239
01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:23.060
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is getting his blue belt.</v>

2240
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:26.480
<v Speaker 2>And for people who don't understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very difficult to accomplishment.</v>

2241
01:27:26.481 --> 01:27:30.020
<v Speaker 2>To get your Booba is not easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to do.</v>

2242
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 2>And that if you can get your blue belt </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

2243
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I'll never get my black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2244
01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:35.390
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me,</v>

2245
01:27:35.391 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get your fucking blue belt,</v>

2246
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you can get your black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just keep going.</v>

2247
01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2248
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.711
<v Speaker 1>But it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said,</v>

2249
01:27:41.711 --> 01:27:43.930
<v Speaker 1>like you said for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that success,</v>

2250
01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.720
<v Speaker 1>which runs counter to sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of team sports right now anyway.</v>

2251
01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids.</v>

2252
01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:51.020
<v Speaker 1>So you give them that opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2253
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I've got again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle boy who's,</v>

2254
01:27:53.141 --> 01:27:53.974
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2255
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:55.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six and right now he's,</v>

2256
01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:58.450
<v Speaker 1>he's that kid who likes to know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

2257
01:27:58.451 --> 01:27:59.284
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the parameters are and likes to </v>

2258
01:28:00.551 --> 01:28:03.250
<v Speaker 1>know that there's a system in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2259
01:28:03.251 --> 01:28:05.320
<v Speaker 1>So he's the kid have all been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very aggressive too,</v>

2260
01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:06.580
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very physical kid.</v>

2261
01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.414
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been looking at what's out there </v>

2262
01:28:08.921 --> 01:28:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and where we live to see where would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good spot for him.</v>

2263
01:28:11.591 --> 01:28:14.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's definitely the kid of the three</v>

2264
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.810
<v Speaker 1>that he looks at that and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2265
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I can go from here to here to here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2266
01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:20.163
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good thing.</v>

2267
01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get them in more involved</v>

2268
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.393
<v Speaker 2>in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk afterwards and I'll find out </v>

2269
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:25.000
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's near you.</v>

2270
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:26.620
<v Speaker 2>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would find out what's good.</v>

2271
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:28.720
<v Speaker 2>But I can't recommend that enough for </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

2272
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.703
<v Speaker 2>for young boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because it takes away this </v>

2273
01:28:31.811 --> 01:28:32.644
<v Speaker 2>fear of engaging with other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes her with his fear of getting </v>

2274
01:28:36.731 --> 01:28:38.500
<v Speaker 2>your ass kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fear of the unknown.</v>

2275
01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:39.334
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wind up getting involved in fights </v>

2276
01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:42.963
<v Speaker 2>accidentally because your posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stick your fucking chest up and you </v>

2277
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:51.840
<v Speaker 2>don't know the consequences are so alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you that you,</v>

2278
01:28:51.841 --> 01:28:56.841
<v Speaker 2>you wind up talking too loud or trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bluff someone and you can fuck up and</v>

2279
01:28:58.001 --> 01:28:59.260
<v Speaker 2>run into the wrong dude.</v>

2280
01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

2281
01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.473
<v Speaker 1>it's like a concealed carry permits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what the hell you're </v>

2282
01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.214
<v Speaker 1>doing and if you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline and if you're not constantly </v>

2283
01:29:07.591 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2284
01:29:09.361 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a serious potential for fuck up.</v>

2285
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:14.460
<v Speaker 2>What's a serious potential for fuckup </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's my own issue.</v>

2286
01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 2>My personal issue with all these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>states that are,</v>

2287
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.000
<v Speaker 2>that are there open carry states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't even have to have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

2289
01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>

2290
01:29:25.411 --> 01:29:26.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big sport is second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have guns so let me get that out of </v>

2291
01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:28.944
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think you should learn how to </v>

2292
01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.580
<v Speaker 2>fucking use a gun before you should get </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2293
01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you,</v>

2294
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.960
<v Speaker 2>how come I can get a car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go through all this shit.</v>

2295
01:29:36.961 --> 01:29:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn how to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to fill out forms.</v>

2296
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just go get a gun.</v>

2297
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you do is just not be a criminal and</v>

2298
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you can get a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems crazy to me.</v>

2299
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.470
<v Speaker 1>The training aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it anybody who's serious about,</v>

2300
01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:50.570
<v Speaker 1>about weapons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's,</v>

2301
01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.710
<v Speaker 1>who's dealt with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's had to carry them for,</v>

2302
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.573
<v Speaker 1>for a livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gained a real appreciation for how </v>

2303
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:58.850
<v Speaker 1>quickly things had south and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2304
01:29:58.851 --> 01:29:59.684
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2305
01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:00.743
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that I agree with you on a </v>

2306
01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.201
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2307
01:30:03.201 --> 01:30:05.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a huge supporter of the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment.</v>

2308
01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2309
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

2310
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2311
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 1>they go walk in safe and happy to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2312
01:30:11.131 --> 01:30:11.964
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just can't get behind the idea of </v>

2313
01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 1>people going out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not training,</v>

2314
01:30:16.771 --> 01:30:20.670
<v Speaker 1>not practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a large,</v>

2315
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:21.810
<v Speaker 1>not a large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2316
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:23.490
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm about to speculate,</v>

2317
01:30:23.491 --> 01:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>so I probably shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

2318
01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a decent percentage of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who go out and they buy it and then they</v>

2319
01:30:28.921 --> 01:30:29.860
<v Speaker 1>put it in a lockbox.</v>

2320
01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they put it in a lockbox and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's it,</v>

2321
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they,</v>

2322
01:30:33.811 --> 01:30:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe sometime they're gonna need it and</v>

2323
01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:36.840
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2324
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:38.063
<v Speaker 1>So it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the training and you just have to </v>

2325
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:41.730
<v Speaker 1>be constant repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant repetition.</v>

2326
01:30:41.731 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you do need to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else shuts down.</v>

2327
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haul your little,</v>

2328
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controls go away and you're,</v>

2329
01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you're depending on your big muscle mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2330
01:30:51.551 --> 01:30:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and repetition and muscle memory.</v>

2331
01:30:53.641 --> 01:30:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't been practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

2332
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:57.750
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well turn it on yourself.</v>

2333
01:30:57.790 --> 01:31:00.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing with fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with everything.</v>

2334
01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:01.700
<v Speaker 2>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're nervous,</v>

2335
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:03.163
<v Speaker 2>all the training comes out and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to fall back on your </v>

2336
01:31:05.811 --> 01:31:07.550
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you train incorrectly,</v>

2337
01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you're going to perform incorrectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>under pressure.</v>

2338
01:31:10.611 --> 01:31:13.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same with firearms is </v>
<v Speaker 2>same with everything.</v>

2339
01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't prepare the,</v>

2340
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:18.410
<v Speaker 2>but see we have this country where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

2341
01:31:18.411 --> 01:31:20.820
<v Speaker 2>you tried to take well goons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will do well.</v>

2342
01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:25.030
<v Speaker 2>No one's trying to take away your guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it should.</v>

2343
01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:28.700
<v Speaker 2>The idea of firearms owning a firearm </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a right,</v>

2344
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think much like driving a car is a</v>

2345
01:31:33.351 --> 01:31:34.184
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should keep anyone </v>

2346
01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:39.170
<v Speaker 2>from doing it just arbitrarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you should prove that.</v>

2347
01:31:39.171 --> 01:31:41.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what the fuck you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you put other people in danger.</v>

2348
01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what we have with cars by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2349
01:31:44.091 --> 01:31:45.420
<v Speaker 2>It's speedboats too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 2>We got not a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets up</v>

2351
01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:47.993
<v Speaker 1>gasol who's never gotten behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel of a boat before and all of a </v>

2352
01:31:49.891 --> 01:31:51.720
<v Speaker 1>sudden he's doing 30 down the lake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

2353
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:52.400
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2354
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Some rich dick head of buys a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those cigarette.</v>

2355
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2356
01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:56.913
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen those videos of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette butts that go a hundred miles </v>

2357
01:31:59.060 --> 01:31:59.893
<v Speaker 2>an hour?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People flip 'em up in the air and </v>

2358
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:01.310
<v Speaker 2>everybody dies.</v>

2359
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:02.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

2360
01:32:02.001 --> 01:32:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fountain boat.</v>

2361
01:32:03.141 --> 01:32:05.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are insane and yeah,</v>

2362
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:06.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll get some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2363
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:09.140
<v Speaker 1>get somebody or buy one and then they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>show up on the lake.</v>

2364
01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.153
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your kids out water skiing and </v>

2365
01:32:11.841 --> 01:32:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2366
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:13.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearing for their life because,</v>

2367
01:32:13.791 --> 01:32:15.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so point taken,</v>

2368
01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2369
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:21.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you would tie in the,</v>

2370
01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:26.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purchase with the training with the,</v>

2371
01:32:26.031 --> 01:32:27.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing approving,</v>

2372
01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2373
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you'd do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's extremely difficult.</v>

2374
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Psychological evaluation as the bad idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2376
01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a bad idea to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>people a bunch of questions,</v>

2377
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.943
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just try to get someone who's a </v>

2378

<v Speaker 2>qualified individual to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2379
01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:44.870

<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2382
01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.670
<v Speaker 2>but that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to weed out some folks that</v>

2383
01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:55.070
<v Speaker 2>could be a problem and people have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with that.</v>

2384
01:32:55.190 --> 01:32:56.660

<v Speaker 2>you're trying to take where it guns.</v>

2385
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:59.900
<v Speaker 2>One of these liberals get involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this process and they say,</v>

2386
01:32:59.901 --> 01:33:01.790
<v Speaker 2>no one's qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they want.</v>

2402
01:33:26.251 --> 01:33:27.084
<v Speaker 1>one of the other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never woken up in the morning and </v>

2403
01:33:28.411 --> 01:33:29.730
<v Speaker 1>thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have no problems with waiting and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got teams in my company that do nothing </v>

2407
01:33:39.511 --> 01:33:41.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not for purposes of,</v>

2410
01:33:43.121 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 1>of a weapons permit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2411
01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.613
<v Speaker 1>I know how difficult that process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>even for relatively straightforward due </v>

2412
01:33:49.831 --> 01:33:50.664
<v Speaker 1>diligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that I have no problems </v>

2413
01:33:53.521 --> 01:33:56.260
<v Speaker 1>with expanded background checks and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed that a lot of people,</v>

2414
01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now a screaming and saying,</v>

2415
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:59.810
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug,</v>

2416
01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.390
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge supporter of the,</v>

2417
01:34:02.391 --> 01:34:04.350
<v Speaker 1>of the Second Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NRA member,</v>

2418
01:34:04.351 --> 01:34:05.490
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2419
01:34:05.491 --> 01:34:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless it.</v>

2420
01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:10.680
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be able to,</v>

2421
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:12.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find those,</v>

2422
01:34:12.061 --> 01:34:13.920
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas,</v>

2423
01:34:13.921 --> 01:34:17.850
<v Speaker 1>those answers or at least talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them without immediately started to pull</v>

2424
01:34:17.851 --> 01:34:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the pins on the grenades and thrown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2425
01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.461
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2426
01:34:20.461 --> 01:34:23.300
<v Speaker 1>going back to the earlier conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>about politics and the yachts and so,</v>

2427
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:24.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably no other,</v>

2428
01:34:24.901 --> 01:34:27.930
<v Speaker 1>well there's other emotive issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly with the second amendment,</v>

2429
01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:29.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you're going to spend a </v>

2430
01:34:30.001 --> 01:34:31.620
<v Speaker 1>little bit more time on a background </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

2431
01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:32.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got to rush into the store and </v>

2432
01:34:33.481 --> 01:34:34.111
<v Speaker 1>buy your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2433
01:34:34.111 --> 01:34:34.944
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your handgun and get out of there as </v>

2434
01:34:36.181 --> 01:34:38.450
<v Speaker 1>quick as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

2435
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take,</v>

2436
01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:41.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a little time.</v>

2437
01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so otherwise to kill yourself.</v>

2438
01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I dunno.</v>

2439
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2440
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:47.490
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody exists in the center anymore.</v>

2441
01:34:47.491 --> 01:34:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Nobody exists in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2442
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:50.643
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if guy who supports a second </v>

2443
01:34:52.211 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 2>amendment saying something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be problematic and you're going to</v>

2444
01:34:55.181 --> 01:34:55.920
<v Speaker 2>get criticized.</v>

2445
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I run for governor out in Idaho,</v>

2446
01:34:57.681 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone's</v>

2447
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.470
<v Speaker 3>going to pull that one up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see what he said?</v>

2448
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:03.080
<v Speaker 3>And you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is that a problem?</v>

2449
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand how anybody </v>

2450
01:35:04.701 --> 01:35:07.010
<v Speaker 3>could be against background checks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2451
01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could someone be against training?</v>

2452
01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 3>How could somebody be against firearm </v>
<v Speaker 3>education?</v>

2453
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:15.260
<v Speaker 3>How could somebody be against that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2454
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Well when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get a hunting license,</v>

2455
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you have to go through a hunter's safety</v>
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

2456
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.150
<v Speaker 3>And the hunter safety course is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>extensive.</v>

2457
01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:23.984
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of questions you have to </v>

2458
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:26.804
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to know why the fuck is that </v>

2459
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 3>the case with hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the case with a gun.</v>

2460
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about self defense?</v>

2461
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:33.524
<v Speaker 3>So it shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have all these junior have </v>

2462
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 3>to have an understanding of how to use a</v>
<v Speaker 3>safety.</v>

2463
01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't yet have the variations in </v>
<v Speaker 3>training for uh,</v>

2464
01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:46.040
<v Speaker 3>or classroom work for concealed carry </v>
<v Speaker 3>permits.</v>

2465
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:47.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got,</v>

2466
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:50.450
<v Speaker 3>you got great training programs and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got less than,</v>

2467
01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 3>less than great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Significantly less than.</v>

2468
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:53.084
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're talking about carrying a </v>

2469
01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:58.520
<v Speaker 3>weapon out in public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is an enormous responsibility.</v>

2470
01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's important,</v>

2471
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:01.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2472
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:03.410
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2473
01:36:03.411 --> 01:36:05.540
<v Speaker 3>it falls in line with what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2474
01:36:05.541 --> 01:36:06.374
<v Speaker 3>How do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you get to that point if as </v>

2475
01:36:08.481 --> 01:36:09.314
<v Speaker 3>soon as you raise that issue again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people start throwing hand grenades </v>

2476
01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.040
<v Speaker 3>agile and you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2477
01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:13.731
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

2478
01:36:13.731 --> 01:36:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm raising this as a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's something,</v>

2479
01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 3>some other tact here that we can take </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>

2480
01:36:19.011 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the second amendment,</v>

2481
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:21.740
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every fucking thing out there,</v>

2482
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:22.710
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2483
01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll let you know.</v>

2484
01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2485
01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.130
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either all this or all that.</v>

2486
01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Instead of saying it the early outset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2487
01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would have been wrong with saying,</v>

2488
01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:31.761
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2489
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:32.211
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2490
01:36:32.211 --> 01:36:33.560
<v Speaker 3>let's do preexisting conditions.</v>

2491
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep kids on their health plans </v>
<v Speaker 3>for their parents a little bit longer.</v>

2492
01:36:37.431 --> 01:36:40.400
<v Speaker 3>And then let's try to figure out where </v>
<v Speaker 3>else we can make improvements.</v>

2493
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:44.450
<v Speaker 3>But it's all one thing or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things about owning a</v>

2494
01:36:44.451 --> 01:36:45.590
<v Speaker 3>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

2495
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.990
<v Speaker 3>it's very important to anybody that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun.</v>

2496
01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You should want to be educated in proper</v>
<v Speaker 3>firearm safety.</v>

2497
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 3>If you have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should want this.</v>

2498
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 3>So training shouldn't be something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would fight.</v>

2499
01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.280
<v Speaker 3>It should be something that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>would embrace.</v>

2500
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.233
<v Speaker 3>If you have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand the dangers and the </v>

2501
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:04.364
<v Speaker 3>consequences of having a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also understand that you need </v>

2502
01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 3>someone to show you how to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have anybody who puts it in</v>

2503
01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:13.130
<v Speaker 3>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2504
01:37:13.131 --> 01:37:16.430
<v Speaker 3>always have your finger off the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the safety.</v>

2505
01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:19.310
<v Speaker 3>No it no it when it's pushed back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2506
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're here.</v>

2507
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:22.300
<v Speaker 3>When it's pushed forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ready to rock.</v>

2508
01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things understand these things.</v>

2509
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Well I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2510
01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:28.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2511
01:37:28.671 --> 01:37:30.980
<v Speaker 3>if you live out west and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2512
01:37:30.981 --> 01:37:31.760
<v Speaker 3>not dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

2513
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean cause down south you could argue </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say anything,</v>

2514
01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:34.333
<v Speaker 3>mountain culture and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain appreciation for </v>

2515
01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:39.523
<v Speaker 3>both the use of weapons and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility involved because there </v>

2516
01:37:42.741 --> 01:37:45.260
<v Speaker 3>are so many people out there that a hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are so many.</v>

2517
01:37:45.261 --> 01:37:46.094
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I the,</v>

2518
01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2519
01:37:47.181 --> 01:37:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I would suspect that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2520
01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody I know that that owns a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapon,</v>

2521
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:53.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to the range they,</v>

2522
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:54.343
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they're out practicing their target </v>

2523
01:37:55.861 --> 01:37:56.150
<v Speaker 3>hunting</v>

2524
01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:57.330
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before hunting season,</v>

2525
01:37:57.331 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Shari shows up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're working the problem.</v>

2526
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that's true in,</v>

2527
01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 1>in a major urban centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2528
01:38:04.741 --> 01:38:05.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>

2529
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2530
01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2531
01:38:08.901 --> 01:38:11.780
<v Speaker 2>there's ranges that you can go to where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2532
01:38:11.781 --> 01:38:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take firearms lessons.</v>

2533
01:38:13.611 --> 01:38:17.030
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that it's not mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the variants,</v>

2534
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:20.840
<v Speaker 2>the different rules that you have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different states.</v>

2535
01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Like Arizona is an open carry state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2536
01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just go to the store,</v>

2537
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:27.080
<v Speaker 2>you're not a felon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a gun,</v>

2538
01:38:27.081 --> 01:38:28.370
<v Speaker 2>just walk around with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2539
01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:29.240
<v Speaker 1>You have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

2540
01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2541
01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it causes problems.</v>

2542
01:38:32.651 --> 01:38:33.484
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on who you're talking to in </v>

2543
01:38:35.211 --> 01:38:35.981
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2544
01:38:35.981 --> 01:38:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2545
01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:38.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of folks in law </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>

2546
01:38:38.231 --> 01:38:39.430
<v Speaker 1>they look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2547
01:38:39.490 --> 01:38:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2548
01:38:41.591 --> 01:38:44.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not what they would prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not up to them to,</v>

2549
01:38:44.601 --> 01:38:46.540
<v Speaker 1>to make that call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

2550
01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2551
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.113
<v Speaker 1>I look at it and then I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one issue that probably </v>

2552
01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:56.650
<v Speaker 1>summarizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2553
01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:57.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2554
01:38:58.150 --> 01:38:58.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>

2555
01:38:58.991 --> 01:39:01.450
<v Speaker 1>the emotive nature of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of politics nowadays,</v>

2556
01:39:01.451 --> 01:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably this one.</v>

2557
01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a big,</v>

2558
01:39:03.941 --> 01:39:06.490
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten past the whole gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you know,</v>

2559
01:39:06.491 --> 01:39:09.280
<v Speaker 1>the abortion thing always flares up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>always will probably,</v>

2560
01:39:09.281 --> 01:39:10.210
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2561
01:39:10.211 --> 01:39:12.000
<v Speaker 1>the second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2562
01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and so you do think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2563
01:39:13.601 --> 01:39:14.434
<v Speaker 1>well how do we can set the default </v>
<v Speaker 1>position for the administration is </v>

2564
01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.170
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2565
01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:18.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>

2566
01:39:18.701 --> 01:39:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing it up.</v>

2567
01:39:19.690 --> 01:39:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2568
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they misplayed as well.</v>

2569
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I think if there was more compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more discussion in the center where they</v>

2570
01:39:28.271 --> 01:39:30.580
<v Speaker 1>had this quietly outside of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2571
01:39:30.581 --> 01:39:30.921
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2572
01:39:30.921 --> 01:39:31.754
<v Speaker 1>the realm of media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just seem to be unable to do </v>

2573
01:39:33.851 --> 01:39:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time there's an incident,</v>

2574
01:39:35.201 --> 01:39:38.470
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you see is somebody from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the administration up behind the podium,</v>

2575
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:39.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making statements and talking about gun </v>

2576
01:39:41.411 --> 01:39:43.720
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that fuels the other side that fuels</v>

2577
01:39:43.721 --> 01:39:46.540
<v Speaker 1>the right where the side with thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to take away all our</v>

2578
01:39:46.541 --> 01:39:47.374
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because they see this and there's </v>

2579
01:39:49.661 --> 01:39:50.920
<v Speaker 1>nothing reason to going on</v>

2580
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:51.783
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reasonable consideration of </v>

2581
01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:56.810
<v Speaker 2>the pros and cons of this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one's,</v>

2582
01:39:57.610 --> 01:40:00.450
<v Speaker 2>there's no one's stepping in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2583
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:04.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like the FBI and apple dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's like.</v>

2584
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:06.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it all on one side.</v>

2585
01:40:06.951 --> 01:40:09.200
<v Speaker 1>You've got all on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is,</v>

2586
01:40:09.201 --> 01:40:10.034
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could have found a solution here </v>

2587
01:40:11.091 --> 01:40:12.640
<v Speaker 1>somewhere if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2588
01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2589
01:40:13.891 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we'd been at,</v>

2590
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although who knows,</v>

2591
01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple seems to be inclined to draw a </v>

2592
01:40:20.751 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 1>line under this particular,</v>

2593
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.270
<v Speaker 2>she was there trying to get into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's phone.</v>

2594
01:40:25.271 --> 01:40:27.880
<v Speaker 2>The killer who killed those people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>San Bernardino.</v>

2595
01:40:27.881 --> 01:40:30.810
<v Speaker 2>They want to get into his phone and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2596
01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:34.060
<v Speaker 2>FBI wants apple to engineer some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a back door.</v>

2597
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:34.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

2598
01:40:34.861 --> 01:40:36.480
<v Speaker 1>here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>

2599
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>side for had,</v>

2600
01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.660
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2601
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 1>three phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that we know about two of them,</v>

2602
01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:43.320
<v Speaker 1>he destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he completely destroyed him.</v>

2603
01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2604
01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:45.023
<v Speaker 1>the bureau has been looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take nothing recoverable off those </v>

2605
01:40:47.101 --> 01:40:49.320
<v Speaker 1>systems and they've asked a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for assistance.</v>

2606
01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.630
<v Speaker 1>So they had the other phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was in his truck,</v>

2607
01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 1>which is his work phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was belonged to the county.</v>

2608
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.580
<v Speaker 1>And so they went to the county bureau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they went to the county,</v>

2609
01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they pulled this phone out of the </v>

2610
01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:00.184
<v Speaker 1>truck and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to get the information off of </v>

2611
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:05.290
<v Speaker 1>this thing because you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phone,</v>

2612
01:41:05.291 --> 01:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>a phone nowadays everybody keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything on their phone.</v>

2613
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

2614
01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:09.874
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the support they pulled and </v>

2615
01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:12.064
<v Speaker 1>they found out that he had shut off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>function that a uploads data to the </v>

2616
01:41:15.491 --> 01:41:16.660
<v Speaker 1>cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2617
01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:17.494
<v Speaker 1>in October.</v>

2618
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.740
<v Speaker 1>And so they were able to get everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to October,</v>

2619
01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but then that's two full months prior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attack.</v>

2620
01:41:23.650 --> 01:41:24.341
<v Speaker 1>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2621
01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:25.880
<v Speaker 1>well we can't get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

2622
01:41:25.881 --> 01:41:26.651
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2623
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:27.760
<v Speaker 1>the phone has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2624
01:41:27.761 --> 01:41:28.594
<v Speaker 1>this default position where if you try </v>
<v Speaker 1>the password 10 times and it erases </v>

2625
01:41:31.451 --> 01:41:33.610
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took the phone,</v>

2626
01:41:33.611 --> 01:41:34.444
<v Speaker 1>the bureau took the f,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phone to apple and this was well </v>

2627
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 1>before they had to go get a court order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well before it became public knowledge.</v>

2628
01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:40.923
<v Speaker 1>They actually went and had numerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet conversations with apple and they </v>

2629
01:41:43.451 --> 01:41:45.760
<v Speaker 1>went to apple and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally said,</v>

2630
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you can take the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it on your campus,</v>

2631
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>keeping in your facility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in a,</v>

2632
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:51.160
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2633
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:51.993
<v Speaker 1>wherever put it in your lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we're asking is for you to create a </v>

2634
01:41:55.301 --> 01:41:58.720
<v Speaker 1>systems information file that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>force on that phone,</v>

2635
01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:03.430
<v Speaker 1>that one phone and pull the tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then allows you to brute force the</v>

2636
01:42:03.431 --> 01:42:08.431
<v Speaker 1>password and get the texts off of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the data off of there and exists and</v>

2637
01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:11.620
<v Speaker 1>then you can destroy the sif,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems information file.</v>

2638
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.770
<v Speaker 1>You can keep the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even need to touch it.</v>

2639
01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:15.550
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2640
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 1>whatever you just give us the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on the phone.</v>

2641
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:21.760
<v Speaker 1>An apple has has been helpful in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

2642
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.863
<v Speaker 1>They've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been helpful in the past and </v>

2643
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:26.103
<v Speaker 1>this time for some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever motivation they've decided </v>

2644
01:42:29.861 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 1>to draw a line in the sand and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2645
01:42:31.571 --> 01:42:32.404
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not as if they haven't been </v>

2646
01:42:35.471 --> 01:42:37.030
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's an ongoing dialogue.</v>

2647
01:42:37.031 --> 01:42:37.864
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's disingenuous to say that apple is </v>

2648
01:42:40.061 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2649
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bulwark for privacy because they </v>

2650
01:42:44.801 --> 01:42:47.020
<v Speaker 1>have been helpful in the past and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will continue to be helpful,</v>

2651
01:42:47.021 --> 01:42:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I suppose in their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for this particular phone,</v>

2652
01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:52.060
<v Speaker 1>for this one time where they could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>held onto the phone,</v>

2653
01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.133
<v Speaker 1>created that Sif destroyed the sif at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that moment that they've pulled the </v>

2654
01:42:56.651 --> 01:42:57.160
<v Speaker 1>texts off.</v>

2655
01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's done.</v>

2656
01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.230
<v Speaker 1>So now what Tim Cook is saying is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's creating a back door.</v>

2657
01:43:02.231 --> 01:43:04.570
<v Speaker 1>He's not saying that he's saying it </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates a precedent,</v>

2658
01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:10.190
<v Speaker 1>but the precedent was already that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bureau goes through the,</v>

2659
01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:11.293
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process the congress has set and </v>

2660
01:43:14.351 --> 01:43:18.370
<v Speaker 1>then goes through that process and gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>a court order and the court,</v>

2661
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 1>then it looks at it and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2662
01:43:19.691 --> 01:43:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you've got probable cause you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable concern here.</v>

2663
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they provide a court order,</v>

2664
01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:27.250
<v Speaker 1>then they go and they make this request </v>
<v Speaker 1>for assistance.</v>

2665
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.850
<v Speaker 1>You're also talking about a dead guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a guy who shot 14 people,</v>

2666
01:43:30.851 --> 01:43:32.770
<v Speaker 1>14 people killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 people.</v>

2667
01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard all sorts of things.</v>

2668
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people say to me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2669
01:43:37.331 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

2670
01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:42.370
<v Speaker 1>because I understand fully the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of finding the right place on</v>

2671
01:43:42.371 --> 01:43:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the pendulum for Security and privacy.</v>

2672
01:43:45.250 --> 01:43:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

2673
01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's not,</v>

2674
01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:49.253
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should always have that </v>

2675
01:43:49.511 --> 01:43:50.344
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of that is then during the </v>

2676
01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 1>course of that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress and the courts,</v>

2677
01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.490
<v Speaker 1>they make those decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that pendulum,</v>

2678
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:59.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settle between security and privacy and </v>

2679
01:44:01.791 --> 01:44:02.660
<v Speaker 1>that settles here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2680
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:03.494
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's what the bureau or whomever </v>

2681
01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:05.264
<v Speaker 1>has to go through to get approval to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some assistance and that's where it </v>

2682
01:44:08.690 --> 01:44:09.523
<v Speaker 1>stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know to say that because now </v>

2683
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:13.814
<v Speaker 1>you've got all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all three branches of government have </v>

2684
01:44:14.601 --> 01:44:15.141
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2685
01:44:15.141 --> 01:44:18.770
<v Speaker 1>we think that really we could use this </v>
<v Speaker 1>information off of this phone.</v>

2686
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:20.360
<v Speaker 1>But I've heard everybody say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2687
01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.250
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just do the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation?</v>

2688
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:23.084
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they fucking done the rest of </v>

2689
01:44:23.721 --> 01:44:24.554
<v Speaker 1>the investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They done all the other investigative </v>

2690
01:44:26.151 --> 01:44:26.984
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you saying in a situation </v>

2691
01:44:28.341 --> 01:44:29.160
<v Speaker 1>like this?</v>

2692
01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:29.993
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want them to do 80% of the </v>

2693
01:44:30.951 --> 01:44:32.330
<v Speaker 1>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've got,</v>

2694
01:44:32.331 --> 01:44:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've got material on here who,</v>

2695
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 1>which may lead to operational activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2696
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:38.474
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in finding other people who were </v>

2697
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:44.060
<v Speaker 1>involved or finding people overseas who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in somehow assisting or whatever it</v>

2698
01:44:44.061 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 1>may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying,</v>

2699
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:46.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just now,</v>

2700
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of this,</v>

2701
01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:50.540
<v Speaker 1>we're not asking for a back door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're asking for that,</v>

2702
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2703
01:44:51.150 --> 01:44:53.480
<v Speaker 1>that one phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where this whole thing is,</v>

2704
01:44:53.481 --> 01:44:56.240
<v Speaker 1>is really headed south and it's become </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that,</v>

2705
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:58.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is erroneous.</v>

2706
01:44:58.101 --> 01:45:00.380
<v Speaker 1>But I understand what Tim Cook is saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the precedent,</v>

2707
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:01.970
<v Speaker 1>although not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

2708
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.250
<v Speaker 1>they've done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason for this one,</v>

2709
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.770
<v Speaker 1>they're drawing a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2710
01:45:06.771 --> 01:45:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard that,</v>

2711
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:10.550
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just do the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation and skip this part?</v>

2712
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:13.630
<v Speaker 1>What I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2713
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow that logic train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other people,</v>

2714
01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:16.911
<v Speaker 1>other people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2715
01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:18.350
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just get it off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metadata?</v>

2716
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:19.663
<v Speaker 1>And that's another one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people never believed what the </v>

2717
01:45:21.711 --> 01:45:22.544
<v Speaker 1>government was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the metro fucking data was numbers </v>

2718
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:26.780
<v Speaker 1>and volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

2719
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:28.400
<v Speaker 1>There was no information to be had </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2720
01:45:28.401 --> 01:45:29.234
<v Speaker 1>You could sit in a fucking room full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>metadata and not know what the hell </v>

2721
01:45:31.371 --> 01:45:32.204
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to go through the court process </v>

2722
01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:35.960
<v Speaker 1>to then get that particular numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2723
01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:36.893
<v Speaker 3>So here's my question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is what came up with the </v>

2724
01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:40.403
<v Speaker 3>Edward Snowden thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were saying that the government is </v>

2725
01:45:41.191 --> 01:45:42.024
<v Speaker 3>monitoring all cell phone data </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly and they can get information </v>

2726
01:45:45.811 --> 01:45:46.291
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2727
01:45:46.291 --> 01:45:48.900
<v Speaker 3>this kind of proves that not to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2728
01:45:48.901 --> 01:45:50.310
<v Speaker 3>But people don't look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

2729
01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:53.610
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't make that leap back and say,</v>

2730
01:45:53.730 --> 01:45:55.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe that was a fallacy.</v>

2731
01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2732
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.640
<v Speaker 3>The metadata was sweeping up all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those numbers and volume.</v>

2733
01:45:59.910 --> 01:46:02.340
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not enough to what end.</v>

2734
01:46:02.341 --> 01:46:03.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so some people would say,</v>

2735
01:46:03.421 --> 01:46:04.960
<v Speaker 3>once they realized what it was actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2736
01:46:04.961 --> 01:46:05.551
<v Speaker 3>then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2737
01:46:05.551 --> 01:46:06.384
<v Speaker 3>but that's so what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're just collecting the shit in </v>

2738
01:46:08.491 --> 01:46:09.720
<v Speaker 3>the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not doing any good.</v>

2739
01:46:09.721 --> 01:46:11.580
<v Speaker 3>So they shouldn't even collect that </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

2740
01:46:11.730 --> 01:46:12.563
<v Speaker 3>So what Edward Snowden was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>is essentially just when it pertains to </v>

2741
01:46:16.231 --> 01:46:17.700
<v Speaker 3>email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2742
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:18.623
<v Speaker 3>he said they're collecting all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that the NSA is collecting </v>

2743
01:46:22.261 --> 01:46:26.130
<v Speaker 3>all this information in regards to cell </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone data and the recording.</v>

2744
01:46:26.131 --> 01:46:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Every phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recording,</v>

2745
01:46:27.601 --> 01:46:29.250
<v Speaker 3>all these text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2746
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is that not true?</v>

2747
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:31.141
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2748
01:46:31.141 --> 01:46:32.520
<v Speaker 3>I frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>

2749
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Of course nobody's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2750
01:46:34.861 --> 01:46:35.730
<v Speaker 3>this is a very emotive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2751
01:46:35.731 --> 01:46:37.200
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to say,</v>

2752
01:46:37.201 --> 01:46:38.034
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the fuck are you </v>

2753
01:46:38.631 --> 01:46:39.464
<v Speaker 3>talking about?</v>

2754
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no aluminum.</v>

2755
01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>There is nobody right now unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrorist,</v>

2756
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:47.430
<v Speaker 1>a terrorist suspect or a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2757
01:46:47.431 --> 01:46:49.500
<v Speaker 1>nobody in the government hooks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

2758
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to tell</v>

2759
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you your Dick pics or safe ladies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen,</v>

2760
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:52.883
<v Speaker 2>Dick Pics are absolutely Jina pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been floating around all your </v>

2761
01:46:56.311 --> 01:46:57.890
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2762
01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:58.953
<v Speaker 2>Goes a secure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to route those around </v>

2763
01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:01.524
<v Speaker 2>that you would rat you out for those as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of shit and unamerican in the </v>

2764
01:47:04.411 --> 01:47:05.920
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2765
01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:08.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really eyeopening thing though,</v>

2766
01:47:08.491 --> 01:47:09.324
<v Speaker 2>because this case kind of throws that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all into jeopardy cause everybody was </v>

2767
01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:12.690
<v Speaker 2>like concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2768
01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:13.524
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government can check in on all your </v>

2769
01:47:15.031 --> 01:47:15.864
<v Speaker 2>phone calls and all your text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this would clearly be a case where </v>

2770
01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:20.850
<v Speaker 2>they would want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't,</v>

2771
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.033
<v Speaker 2>they can't do it here without the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the judge granting this order and </v>

2772
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tell me why did,</v>

2773
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.360
<v Speaker 2>there was a recent court order right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there ruled in favor of apple.</v>

2774
01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.750
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was in New York.</v>

2775
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And that was an interesting case as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2776
01:47:34.131 --> 01:47:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably going to set a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precedent for maybe,</v>

2777
01:47:37.130 --> 01:47:40.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll see cause it's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different what the judge essentially was</v>

2778
01:47:40.971 --> 01:47:42.690
<v Speaker 1>saying in that case and it involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2779
01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:43.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2780
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:46.250
<v Speaker 1>narco trafficking investigation that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2781
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't just for terrorism.</v>

2782
01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what if this was for pedophilia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2783
01:47:51.771 --> 01:47:54.800
<v Speaker 1>I imagine a large Pete Ophelia ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to say?</v>

2784
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:55.663
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to catch those fucking </v>

2785
01:47:56.781 --> 01:48:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Douche bags that are involved in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because privacy,</v>

2786
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:03.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the privacy aspect,</v>

2787
01:48:03.021 --> 01:48:05.540
<v Speaker 1>but each case has to be looked at on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>merits and if,</v>

2788
01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:07.400
<v Speaker 1>and if you say through the courts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>

2789
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:08.383
<v Speaker 1>through the congress that these are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoops that the bureau has to jump </v>

2790
01:48:10.611 --> 01:48:12.200
<v Speaker 1>through and they jumped through those </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoops,</v>

2791
01:48:12.201 --> 01:48:13.670
<v Speaker 1>then then what?</v>

2792
01:48:13.670 --> 01:48:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Then it's up to each company to decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they want to support it or not.</v>

2793
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems strange.</v>

2794
01:48:17.541 --> 01:48:18.374
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point being is that the one in New </v>

2795
01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:20.720
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judge essentially was saying,</v>

2796
01:48:20.721 --> 01:48:21.590
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want us,</v>

2797
01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:22.693
<v Speaker 1>you want the courts to make a decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this for something that Congress </v>

2798
01:48:24.801 --> 01:48:27.770
<v Speaker 1>should really make a decision on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in a way,</v>

2799
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:30.890
<v Speaker 1>his decision was a pushback against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of that,</v>

2800
01:48:30.891 --> 01:48:31.724
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2801
01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.670
<v Speaker 1>the bureau was basing this on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very old law.</v>

2802
01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.920
<v Speaker 1>And so the judge is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2803
01:48:35.921 --> 01:48:38.840
<v Speaker 1>you relying on a law that's a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years old or whatever.</v>

2804
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe instead we should be having this </v>

2805
01:48:42.111 --> 01:48:45.830
<v Speaker 1>looked at it through the legislature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a,</v>

2806
01:48:45.831 --> 01:48:48.350
<v Speaker 1>there was an interesting sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legality to his,</v>

2807
01:48:48.351 --> 01:48:53.010
<v Speaker 1>his response to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely a favorite apple and,</v>

2808
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and sure.</v>

2809
01:48:53.930 --> 01:48:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's legislate it.</v>

2810
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:58.660
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that just maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2811
01:48:59.930 --> 01:49:03.050
<v Speaker 1>there are times when from an operational</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

2812
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you might want to move a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker than asking Congress to take up,</v>

2813
01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:07.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue and debate it and then maybe </v>

2814
01:49:09.591 --> 01:49:10.424
<v Speaker 1>eventually come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe occasionally you're going to </v>

2815
01:49:11.841 --> 01:49:15.560
<v Speaker 1>have moments like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the San Bernardino shooting where you've</v>

2816
01:49:15.561 --> 01:49:20.030
<v Speaker 1>got a phone in your hand and all you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking apple to do is take possession of</v>

2817
01:49:20.031 --> 01:49:21.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who knows?</v>

2818
01:49:21.441 --> 01:49:22.274
<v Speaker 1>Maybe their problem is they're worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they create the sif at that </v>

2819
01:49:24.381 --> 01:49:26.150
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to steal it from them,</v>

2820
01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:27.613
<v Speaker 1>one of their employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they've got an internal </v>

2821
01:49:28.611 --> 01:49:30.590
<v Speaker 1>security issue because then they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy it.</v>

2822
01:49:30.591 --> 01:49:32.230
<v Speaker 1>The bureau's not asking for that phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

2823
01:49:32.231 --> 01:49:33.064
<v Speaker 1>not asking for that Sif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not asking them for to do it on </v>

2824
01:49:35.031 --> 01:49:36.320
<v Speaker 1>any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a sif,</v>

2825
01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but he says systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information flour.</v>

2826
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:40.940
<v Speaker 1>So you just force it onto that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that bypasses the,</v>

2827
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>essentially what the court has done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a very conservative,</v>

2828
01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>conservative interpretation of</v>

2829
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.190
<v Speaker 3>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2830
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 3>And basically saying that this needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>blame.</v>

2831
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:53.260
<v Speaker 3>This is a place where the courts should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be deciding,</v>

2832
01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:54.750
<v Speaker 3>we believe you should be taking this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress.</v>

2833
01:49:54.751 --> 01:49:55.584
<v Speaker 3>And so therefore I don't see why you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislating or asking us to make a </v>

2834
01:49:58.181 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 3>decision on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2835
01:49:59.471 --> 01:50:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I understand the common person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

2836
01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.560
<v Speaker 3>They don't trust the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole Edward Snowden thing.</v>

2837
01:50:04.561 --> 01:50:07.180
<v Speaker 3>And the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's freaking out about that.</v>

2838
01:50:07.181 --> 01:50:08.890
<v Speaker 3>And then they look at this saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2839
01:50:08.891 --> 01:50:11.230
<v Speaker 3>this is the slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2840
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that if the government</v>
<v Speaker 3>has access to your phone play,</v>

2841
01:50:15.101 --> 01:50:15.934
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a fucking mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderer and a guy who's already dead </v>

2842
01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:21.730
<v Speaker 3>and we have one phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2843
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2844
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.140
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2845
01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:27.190
<v Speaker 3>and so to say that you're going to only </v>
<v Speaker 3>do a limited investigation,</v>

2846
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.353
<v Speaker 3>even though you know you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential information and a way to do </v>

2847
01:50:30.911 --> 01:50:32.650
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on an individual basis,</v>

2848
01:50:32.651 --> 01:50:34.060
<v Speaker 3>just one phone only.</v>

2849
01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what the cover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they're asking.</v>

2850
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 3>But can it be that you could never grant</v>
<v Speaker 3>ag?</v>

2851
01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2852
01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.510
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2853
01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:45.100
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't want to get access to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's fucking data.</v>

2854
01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:45.963
<v Speaker 3>And here's where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think going back to that </v>

2855
01:50:47.051 --> 01:50:47.884
<v Speaker 3>overriding theme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is nothing resides in the center </v>

2856
01:50:49.901 --> 01:50:50.740
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2857
01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:51.603
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do have to be concerned about </v>

2858
01:50:52.661 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 3>privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I agree.</v>

2859
01:50:53.651 --> 01:50:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens if you don't?</v>

2860
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Big Brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are times when,</v>

2861
01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:57.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>operational concerns probably override </v>

2862
01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:05.160
<v Speaker 3>at least an element of this where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have common pr or a reason to,</v>

2863
01:51:05.621 --> 01:51:08.320
<v Speaker 3>people can exist in the comment in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle and say,</v>

2864
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:09.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this occasion,</v>

2865
01:51:09.761 --> 01:51:10.594
<v Speaker 3>because you've gone through all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these orders and because we've set up </v>

2866
01:51:12.701 --> 01:51:13.810
<v Speaker 3>this protection now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

2867
01:51:13.811 --> 01:51:15.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apple holds onto it and it,</v>

2868
01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:17.290
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way it works.</v>

2869
01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:20.860
<v Speaker 3>And so therefore apple comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>says there and then the misinformation,</v>

2870
01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:21.723
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they trying to create a backdoor to all </v>

2871
01:51:22.331 --> 01:51:23.500
<v Speaker 3>our apple devices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2872
01:51:23.501 --> 01:51:26.170
<v Speaker 3>what do you think apple does with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>devices that they sell in China?</v>

2873
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:27.343
<v Speaker 3>You think that Chinese government would </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow apple if someone got a talk about </v>

2874
01:51:30.911 --> 01:51:31.744
<v Speaker 3>this in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think the Chinese government </v>

2875
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:35.650
<v Speaker 3>would allow apple to sell devices that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't get into?</v>

2876
01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2877
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:38.480
<v Speaker 3>we could ask apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2878
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Ascap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it would be an issue,</v>

2879
01:51:40.301 --> 01:51:43.840
<v Speaker 3>but I can speak from a friend that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that worked at Google.</v>

2880
01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:47.740
<v Speaker 3>They had a gigantic issue in China with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google because,</v>

2881
01:51:47.741 --> 01:51:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have android phones.</v>

2882
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:50.073
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a big part of the issue is the </v>

2883
01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:53.260
<v Speaker 3>government wanted to have access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>phones.</v>

2884
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:56.020
<v Speaker 3>They also want to have access to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're searching.</v>

2885
01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:58.450
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to know what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>searching.</v>

2886
01:51:58.451 --> 01:51:59.284
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to limit google searches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this gigantic issue they were </v>

2887
01:52:02.291 --> 01:52:03.670
<v Speaker 3>having.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then on top of that,</v>

2888
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2889
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.033
<v Speaker 3>was having to deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>China was kind of ripping off their </v>

2890
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:10.660
<v Speaker 3>system and creating their own version of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2891
01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.630
<v Speaker 3>And is China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is these tactics state sponsor of uh,</v>

2892
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:15.783
<v Speaker 3>economic espionage and cyber crime and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and counter fay openly support </v>

2893
01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:22.534
<v Speaker 3>counterfeit shit to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's entire stores that have apple </v>

2894
01:52:25.331 --> 01:52:26.164
<v Speaker 3>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sell apple products and none of it </v>

2895
01:52:27.851 --> 01:52:30.100
<v Speaker 3>is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the computers are fake.</v>

2896
01:52:30.101 --> 01:52:32.440
<v Speaker 3>All the phones are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the laptops are fake.</v>

2897
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:33.453
<v Speaker 3>None of it is created by Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks exactly like this shit right </v>

2898
01:52:36.161 --> 01:52:38.020
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just all man,</v>

2899
01:52:38.050 --> 01:52:40.680
<v Speaker 3>they don't have laws to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2900
01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:42.460
<v Speaker 3>There's not a rule of law there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though they'd been to,</v>

2901
01:52:42.461 --> 01:52:43.720
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about this for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

2902
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:44.441
<v Speaker 3>They've been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2903
01:52:44.441 --> 01:52:45.274
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a new,</v>

2904
01:52:45.850 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2905
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>this is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why you're going back to that.</v>

2906
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:49.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything goes back in circles.</v>

2907
01:52:49.611 --> 01:52:51.440
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that we need a leader right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that's,</v>

2908
01:52:51.441 --> 01:52:54.600
<v Speaker 1>that's reasoned and pragmatic and smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2909
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.390
<v Speaker 1>clear eyed is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a look at.</v>

2910
01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:01.420
<v Speaker 1>You look at China and you look at a look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at their economy and their is is heading</v>

2911
01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:04.700
<v Speaker 1>south and if using ping their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2912
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:09.701
<v Speaker 1>their economy's not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their growth projections are way off.</v>

2913
01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.313
<v Speaker 1>There's always been this belief that </v>
<v Speaker 1>their numbers have been cooked in </v>

2914
01:53:13.731 --> 01:53:14.564
<v Speaker 1>numerous ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A G that the head of China has been </v>

2915
01:53:17.271 --> 01:53:18.104
<v Speaker 1>consolidating power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been creating new security </v>

2916
01:53:19.491 --> 01:53:20.324
<v Speaker 1>apparatus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been hiding behind this </v>

2917
01:53:22.581 --> 01:53:25.040
<v Speaker 1>anticorruption drive to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>

2918
01:53:25.041 --> 01:53:27.360
<v Speaker 1>part of is consolidation of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2919
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 1>and this idea that Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow this rule of law is coming up.</v>

2920
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Nobody actually believes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are continuing to be incredibly</v>

2921
01:53:35.781 --> 01:53:38.180
<v Speaker 1>aggressive in economic espionage.</v>

2922
01:53:38.210 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're not the only ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have these,</v>

2923
01:53:39.381 --> 01:53:41.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody acts in their own best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

2924
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:44.300
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese have,</v>

2925
01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.393
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four dozen plus academic institutions </v>

2926
01:53:48.171 --> 01:53:49.700
<v Speaker 1>that have funded by the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>

2927
01:53:49.701 --> 01:53:53.550
<v Speaker 1>the PLA and have a responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2928
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 1>economic espionage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing new,</v>

2929
01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.830
<v Speaker 1>new new means of basically stealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2930
01:53:58.760 --> 01:53:59.593
<v Speaker 1>They've got a couple dozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least information warfare units that </v>

2931
01:54:02.091 --> 01:54:02.924
<v Speaker 1>we've identified run by the PLA that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically designed to hoover up </v>

2932
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property and research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and all the rest of that,</v>

2933
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:11.630
<v Speaker 1>not just from us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean from around the globe.</v>

2934
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2935
01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:17.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea,</v>

2936
01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:18.053
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that we would do business </v>

2937
01:54:19.251 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2938
01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:22.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe somehow that the,</v>

2939
01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authorities there in China aren't </v>

2940
01:54:24.921 --> 01:54:25.754
<v Speaker 1>going to have our shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to have whatever it </v>

2941
01:54:27.081 --> 01:54:27.914
<v Speaker 1>may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pharmaceutical company that sets up a </v>

2942
01:54:28.971 --> 01:54:30.880
<v Speaker 1>facility out there isn't going to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>their R.</v>

2943
01:54:30.881 --> 01:54:31.714
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D of course they are.</v>

2944
01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:32.563
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows anybody in a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner who is doing business out in </v>

2945
01:54:34.581 --> 01:54:35.414
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knows as soon as you set foot in there </v>

2946
01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and you establish yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2947
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing or just a sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>

2948
01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:44.240
<v Speaker 1>your information becomes their </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2949

01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 2>wherever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>information is of interest to them.</v>

2987
01:56:10.861 --> 01:56:12.630
<v Speaker 2>The Chinese are a little bit different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

2988
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:13.493
<v Speaker 2>than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2989
01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:14.423
<v Speaker 2>we tend to be very targeted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very specific in our tasking and part </v>

2990
01:56:16.711 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 2>because we're a smaller operation than </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

2991
01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 2>They devote a huge amount of resource to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2992
01:56:21.091 --> 01:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>but they just hoover up whatever's out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2993
01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 2>And then they make a decision as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting or valuable to them or not.</v>

2994
01:56:26.490 --> 01:56:27.750
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2995
01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:28.980
<v Speaker 2>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2996
01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:31.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be coy about this.</v>

2997
01:56:31.231 --> 01:56:32.220
<v Speaker 2>We do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2998
01:56:32.221 --> 01:56:35.580
<v Speaker 2>you better hope we fucking do it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's otherwise,</v>

2999
01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:36.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3000
01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a hugely unlevel playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

3001
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.820
<v Speaker 2>we're sweet angels out in the field of </v>
<v Speaker 2>murders,</v>

3002
01:56:41.821 --> 01:56:42.870
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3003
01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:43.950
<v Speaker 2>And we'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all we're doing is,</v>

3004
01:56:43.951 --> 01:56:44.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3005
01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:45.203
<v Speaker 2>we're all snow precious snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just try to get together and not a </v>

3006
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:48.653
<v Speaker 2>not keep score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where Hillary's email problem </v>

3007
01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>becomes a real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3008
01:56:53.410 --> 01:56:54.243
<v Speaker 2>Because she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by doing this and this sort of in a </v>

3009
01:56:56.561 --> 01:56:58.090
<v Speaker 2>roundabout way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're bringing it all back,</v>

3010
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:59.103
<v Speaker 2>puts it in perspective why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous that she had this unprotected </v>

3011
01:57:02.351 --> 01:57:03.184
<v Speaker 2>email because by copy and pasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>classified information or deciding </v>

3012
01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:11.650
<v Speaker 2>through her own decision making process </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the people that were with her,</v>

3013
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:14.410
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's okay to copy and paste and what's</v>

3014
01:57:14.411 --> 01:57:18.400
<v Speaker 2>not okay to copy and paste and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you go by the established</v>

3015
01:57:18.401 --> 01:57:19.234
<v Speaker 2>protocols of top secret or not top </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret clearance or whatever clearance </v>

3016
01:57:21.821 --> 01:57:22.654
<v Speaker 2>level you have.</v>

3017
01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You're handing that over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3018
01:57:23.811 --> 01:57:24.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3019
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:26.180
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing is they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily care.</v>

3020
01:57:26.181 --> 01:57:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously they,</v>

3021
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3022
01:57:27.441 --> 01:57:29.280
<v Speaker 1>it blows her skirt up to get top secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3023
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:31.040
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll take anything,</v>

3024
01:57:31.041 --> 01:57:32.770
<v Speaker 1>they'll take it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take a,</v>

3025
01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:33.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily,</v>

3026
01:57:33.651 --> 01:57:34.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dribble that goes on through her email </v>

3027
01:57:36.021 --> 01:57:36.854
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just to gain a better understanding </v>

3028
01:57:38.391 --> 01:57:41.200
<v Speaker 1>as to what makes a person tick or who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the people around her.</v>

3029
01:57:41.201 --> 01:57:43.070
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for potential targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3030
01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:44.570
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for,</v>

3031
01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:45.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is there a chink in the armor </v>

3032
01:57:46.581 --> 01:57:49.340
<v Speaker 1>where there's an opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3033
01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:53.000
<v Speaker 1>to get in to her organization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there somebody on the periphery could</v>

3034
01:57:53.001 --> 01:57:54.020
<v Speaker 1>be a landscaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3038
01:57:59.100 --> 01:57:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you going to target?</v>

3039
01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.733
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to target the CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to target the cleaning </v>

3040
01:58:02.181 --> 01:58:03.014
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to target the secretary and </v>

3041
01:58:04.521 --> 01:58:05.630
<v Speaker 1>the caterer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3042
01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

3043

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3044
01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:09.260
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3045
01:58:09.261 --> 01:58:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it everybody,</v>

3046
01:58:10.521 --> 01:58:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like with Ben Gazi,</v>

3047
01:58:11.601 --> 01:58:13.760
<v Speaker 1>people roll their eyes all the private </v>
<v Speaker 1>email server era.</v>

3048
01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:14.773
<v Speaker 1>But if you've been involved in this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand how aggressive it is out </v>

3049
01:58:16.911 --> 01:58:17.601
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3050
01:58:17.601 --> 01:58:18.201
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3051
01:58:18.201 --> 01:58:20.240
<v Speaker 1>not just the Chinese or Russians that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3052
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.740
<v Speaker 1>everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's added.</v>

3053
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3054
01:58:24.710 --> 01:58:25.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3055
01:58:25.181 --> 01:58:26.850
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to understand that it was,</v>

3056
01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:27.561
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3057
01:58:27.561 --> 01:58:29.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a serious problem.</v>

3058
01:58:29.091 --> 01:58:29.871
<v Speaker 1>It was a breach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3059
01:58:29.871 --> 01:58:30.621
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

3060
01:58:30.621 --> 01:58:32.330
<v Speaker 1>going back to the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it had been me,</v>

3061
01:58:32.331 --> 01:58:34.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure I would have been done up and all,</v>

3062
01:58:34.101 --> 01:58:34.934
<v Speaker 1>if it had been somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be backed up and probably </v>

3063
01:58:36.891 --> 01:58:37.460
<v Speaker 1>done time.</v>

3064
01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:40.280
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little discouraging.</v>

3065
01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:41.203
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of that it is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone would go to jail for and yet </v>

3066
01:58:45.070 --> 01:58:46.840
<v Speaker 1>mishandling classified information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3067
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't series of facts.</v>

3068
01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a very serious offense and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in particular,</v>

3069
01:58:50.021 --> 01:58:51.370
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a senior official,</v>

3070
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:52.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God.</v>

3071
01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:52.954
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a very smart person and she </v>

3072
01:58:54.131 --> 01:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3073
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 1>so this idea that somehow she just </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know or,</v>

3074
01:58:56.981 --> 01:58:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

3075
01:58:57.810 --> 01:58:58.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was too busy or I don't know how by </v>

3076
01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 1>blackberry works or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a load of crap.</v>

3077
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3078
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Well this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brings us back to this whole Edward</v>

3079
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Snowden thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3080
01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:09.893
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your position on this and that </v>

3081
01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:12.394
<v Speaker 1>guy and what he did and sort of exposing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the NSA was involved in </v>

3082
01:59:15.641 --> 01:59:16.474
<v Speaker 1>this wide scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic sort of information </v>

3083
01:59:21.881 --> 01:59:24.040
<v Speaker 1>gathering process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hoovering up of,</v>

3084
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:25.680
<v Speaker 1>of a metadata program.</v>

3085
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:27.280
<v Speaker 1>It's gathered me this stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3086
01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:28.151
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3087
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:28.571
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3088
01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:29.404
<v Speaker 1>everybody should have spent more time </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding what the actual technical </v>

3089
01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:35.530
<v Speaker 1>aspects of it work because he gets it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though was problematic.</v>

3090
01:59:35.531 --> 01:59:40.220
<v Speaker 1>He was saying the people that worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him were accessing the emails of ex</v>

3091
01:59:40.221 --> 01:59:42.460
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3092
01:59:42.461 --> 01:59:43.750
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I buying on,</v>

3093
01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe that might've happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3094
01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:46.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a human system.</v>

3095
01:59:46.901 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be some fuck ups.</v>

3096
01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.080
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has a problem.</v>

3097
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3098
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the INS and outs of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>NSA are,</v>

3099
01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of their protocols for,</v>

3100
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3101
01:59:56.770 --> 01:59:59.780
<v Speaker 1>protection firewalls on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on systems at,</v>

3102
01:59:59.850 --> 02:00:00.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3103
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:03.370
<v Speaker 1>it at government agencies tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're used properly,</v>

3104
02:00:03.450 --> 02:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>are pretty robust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

3105
02:00:05.410 --> 02:00:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any human system,</v>

3106
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:07.864
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Tsa is someone going to be </v>

3107
02:00:08.891 --> 02:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>asleep at the wheel and somebody gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>through with a shoe bomb?</v>

3108
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could happen because the human </v>

3109
02:00:12.911 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where do I stand on it?</v>

3110
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And no surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3111
02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3112
02:00:18.461 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on what your experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

3113
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:20.974
<v Speaker 1>And I'd get the fact that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider him a hero or a whistle or </v>

3114
02:00:23.931 --> 02:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3115
02:00:26.770 --> 02:00:27.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's signed paperwork that said he was </v>

3116
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>going to protect national security </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

3117
02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:32.884
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to properly protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the information that he was given </v>

3118
02:00:36.701 --> 02:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't,</v>

3119
02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also,</v>

3120
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>despite what people may want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3121
02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.213
<v Speaker 1>he caused a lot of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous amount of damage in </v>

3122
02:00:50.261 --> 02:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>terms of information that was released </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way that we do things here.</v>

3123
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources and methods that were of extreme</v>

3124
02:00:58.031 --> 02:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>interest to not just a terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

3125
02:01:00.881 --> 02:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>but extreme interest to Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

3126
02:01:03.491 --> 02:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>extreme interest to Iranians.</v>

3127
02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird that he's in Russia right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3128
02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:07.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3129
02:01:07.421 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Go figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3130
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3131
02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so did he do any good?</v>

3132
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he do any good?</v>

3133
02:01:14.290 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3134
02:01:14.770 --> 02:01:15.603
<v Speaker 1>having that conversation is always good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can have that conversation </v>

3135
02:01:17.501 --> 02:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>without him doing what he did and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3136
02:01:20.651 --> 02:01:21.484
<v Speaker 1>and we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part of that responsibility lays on </v>

3137
02:01:23.051 --> 02:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

3138
02:01:24.041 --> 02:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>on an aggressive and inquisitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly aware,</v>

3139
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:29.433
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checks and balances that exist within </v>

3140
02:01:31.211 --> 02:01:32.044
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Intel Committee and then that </v>

3141
02:01:32.871 --> 02:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>would send it in until committee and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these people that need,</v>

3142
02:01:35.070 --> 02:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they tend to play a game in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what the fuck's going on.</v>

3143
02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Like with the interrogation or rendition</v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

3144
02:01:40.071 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>these people were briefed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew what the hell goes on.</v>

3145
02:01:42.231 --> 02:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>But there's a political game in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington where they,</v>

3146
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.863
<v Speaker 1>they get to express outrage when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something becomes a political football </v>

3147
02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3148
02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3149
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did he do any good?</v>

3150
02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:53.193
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about it and that's </v>

3151
02:01:53.721 --> 02:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3152
02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:55.011
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3153
02:01:55.011 --> 02:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3154
02:01:57.110 --> 02:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an,</v>

3155
02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not unsympathetic.</v>

3156
02:02:01.731 --> 02:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't sound right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3157
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the importance of finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper place on the pendulum,</v>

3158
02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:08.233
<v Speaker 1>but I have probably an overriding </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for security because of </v>

3159
02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:12.224
<v Speaker 1>what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that other people have </v>

3160
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:14.354
<v Speaker 1>an overriding appreciation for privacy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have the same </v>

3161
02:02:17.061 --> 02:02:18.940
<v Speaker 1>experiences that they've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different experiences.</v>

3162
02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And so that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

3163
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And all I'm saying is I look at it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my perspective,</v>

3164
02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:26.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at him as a hero </v>

3165
02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>whistleblower in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3166
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3167
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I signed same agreements and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3168
02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm expected to live up to those just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anybody else who does.</v>

3169
02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:38.233
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found a way that he thought was </v>

3170
02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to make his point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have no idea what goes on in his</v>

3171
02:02:45.081 --> 02:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3172
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>I w I just would've thought it would've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been nice if,</v>

3173
02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3174
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:51.943
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've made the point in a way that also </v>

3175
02:02:53.421 --> 02:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>protected our national security</v>

3176
02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:56.980
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could that be done though?</v>

3177
02:02:57.250 --> 02:02:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without exposing what he,</v>

3178
02:02:59.390 --> 02:03:00.223
<v Speaker 2>what exactly did he expose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He exposed the fact that they were </v>

3179
02:03:02.501 --> 02:03:03.334
<v Speaker 2>gathering up metadata and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been people that have said </v>

3180
02:03:07.361 --> 02:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>that it was more than metadata.</v>

3181
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's eight.</v>

3182
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:09.871
<v Speaker 1>It talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3183
02:03:09.871 --> 02:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>surveillance programs and here's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3184
02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots,</v>

3185
02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:14.450
<v Speaker 1>there were lots of little bits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces because he,</v>

3186
02:03:14.451 --> 02:03:15.284
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3187
02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3188
02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>he misappropriated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stole a lot of,</v>

3189
02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was then essentially,</v>

3190
02:03:20.970 --> 02:03:23.400
<v Speaker 1>if anybody thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Edward Snowden was smarter than the</v>

3191
02:03:23.401 --> 02:03:24.234
<v Speaker 1>Chinese authorities or the Russians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't get a hold of </v>

3192
02:03:26.581 --> 02:03:27.414
<v Speaker 1>everything and that somehow he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>secreted that information with Glenn </v>

3193
02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:31.373
<v Speaker 1>Greenwald and a couple others are those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have interests that are completely </v>

3194
02:03:34.651 --> 02:03:37.530
<v Speaker 1>against ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get ahold of that information is,</v>

3195
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:38.443
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty naive thought last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that Edward Snowden is </v>

3196
02:03:41.851 --> 02:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>smarter than the PLA and the resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the FSB and Russia.</v>

3197
02:03:45.991 --> 02:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong.</v>

3198
02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's like the lex luther of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3199
02:03:52.650 --> 02:03:53.483
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an example is the surveillance </v>

3200
02:03:56.041 --> 02:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>programs supposedly that we had against </v>
<v Speaker 1>a European leaders.</v>

3201
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Remember the outreach with Angela Merkel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that,</v>

3202
02:04:03.931 --> 02:04:04.764
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're listening in on some of her </v>

3203
02:04:06.091 --> 02:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that we would have access to,</v>

3204
02:04:08.970 --> 02:04:10.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3205
02:04:10.591 --> 02:04:11.730
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

3206
02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:12.863
<v Speaker 1>because you know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're listening in on the </v>

3207
02:04:13.801 --> 02:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>conversations of their allies and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the French,</v>

3208
02:04:16.231 --> 02:04:17.064
<v Speaker 1>the former head of the dgse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French Intel service turned to the </v>

3209
02:04:19.650 --> 02:04:20.483
<v Speaker 1>head of France at one point when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head of France was secretary blue and </v>

3210
02:04:22.961 --> 02:04:24.590
<v Speaker 1>seek the Lord and how could we be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

3211
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>And the former head of the Intel service</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at them French guy and said,</v>

3212
02:04:29.191 --> 02:04:32.220
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think we do?</v>

3213
02:04:32.221 --> 02:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what we do.</v>

3214
02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:33.953
<v Speaker 2>So this is just always what he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposing is something that everybody </v>

3215
02:04:36.181 --> 02:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the mock outrage,</v>

3216
02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:39.050
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it's like</v>

3217
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.771
<v Speaker 1>walk out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3218
02:04:39.771 --> 02:04:41.630
<v Speaker 1>it was Kabuki theater in Europe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3219
02:04:41.631 --> 02:04:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean all they asked mostly theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3220
02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hand wringing and all the,</v>

3221
02:04:44.901 --> 02:04:45.591
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3222
02:04:45.591 --> 02:04:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that they are Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be allies would be doing this.</v>

3223
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:50.930
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of assumed that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing it already.</v>

3224
02:04:50.931 --> 02:04:51.764
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you what was going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back rooms was the Intel service </v>

3225
02:04:53.901 --> 02:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>directors were all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3226
02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>sitting down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would hope to think that our,</v>

3227
02:04:57.370 --> 02:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>our director was looking at them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3228
02:04:59.331 --> 02:05:00.350
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3229
02:05:00.351 --> 02:05:01.370
<v Speaker 1>And they were probably having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3230
02:05:01.371 --> 02:05:02.540
<v Speaker 1>having a drink and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3231
02:05:02.541 --> 02:05:03.290
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get it.</v>

3232
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>We get to joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3233
02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:05.253
<v Speaker 1>everybody's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that somehow we're the </v>

3234
02:05:08.781 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3235
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>look to French Intel services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly aggressive as an example.</v>

3236
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:15.223
<v Speaker 1>And there had been numerous cases where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've targeted a u s corporations for </v>

3237
02:05:20.001 --> 02:05:22.940
<v Speaker 1>economic espionage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that somehow,</v>

3238
02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should be shocked that one nation</v>

3239
02:05:27.471 --> 02:05:28.304
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is acting in its own self interest in </v>

3240
02:05:29.421 --> 02:05:31.190
<v Speaker 1>listening to other nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3241
02:05:31.191 --> 02:05:34.430
<v Speaker 1>same theory with economic espionage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We better hope we're playing offense and</v>

3242
02:05:34.431 --> 02:05:36.800
<v Speaker 1>defense in the way the world actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

3243
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:40.040
<v Speaker 1>It'd be great if we all held hands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whinging monkeys on Unicorns.</v>

3244
02:05:40.041 --> 02:05:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Fluid are acids and we could all sing </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs together,</v>

3245
02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's not how the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

3246
02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

3247
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:48.920
<v Speaker 1>so that's me disappearing down a rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

3248
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.823
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this rabbit holes kind of important </v>

3249
02:05:51.031 --> 02:05:51.864
<v Speaker 2>to talk about because you actually have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some pretty deep knowledge about this </v>

3250
02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:56.214
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole and this is some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that get speculated left and </v>

3251
02:05:58.921 --> 02:05:59.754
<v Speaker 2>right and back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And either you'd take one side or the </v>

3252
02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:03.360
<v Speaker 2>other and everybody argues about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3253
02:06:03.361 --> 02:06:06.720
<v Speaker 2>no one wants to government to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>unchecked access to your emails,</v>

3254
02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:08.260
<v Speaker 2>your phone that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3255
02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's what people are worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

3256
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:11.004
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that slippery slope that is headed </v>

3257
02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.164
<v Speaker 2>towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying is that everyone </v>

3258
02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:17.340
<v Speaker 2>is always spied on everybody's phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>calls.</v>

3259
02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:18.323
<v Speaker 2>They've always been involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring leaders whenever they could </v>

3260
02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:23.730
<v Speaker 2>and that it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's standard,</v>

3261
02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 2>it's standard protocol.</v>

3262
02:06:25.050 --> 02:06:28.710
<v Speaker 1>It's every nation acts in its own best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest sometimes.</v>

3263
02:06:28.711 --> 02:06:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the u s is the only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that apologizes for it.</v>

3264
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:32.303
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you did nothing else other than </v>

3265
02:06:33.811 --> 02:06:37.670
<v Speaker 1>approach foreign policy from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that every nation action his</v>

3266
02:06:37.671 --> 02:06:38.504
<v Speaker 1>own best interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't get caught short as many </v>

3267
02:06:39.991 --> 02:06:41.550
<v Speaker 1>times as we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Putin.</v>

3268
02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin absolutely is,</v>

3269
02:06:43.921 --> 02:06:46.290
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an old school kgb guy.</v>

3270
02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:47.213
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always regretted that the Soviet </v>

3271
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Union fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He considers it a huge catastrophe.</v>

3272
02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.033
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the biggest catastrophe called </v>

3273
02:06:52.921 --> 02:06:56.820
<v Speaker 1>it of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's been busy ever since.</v>

3274
02:06:56.821 --> 02:06:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure out how to rebuild at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least,</v>

3275
02:06:58.621 --> 02:06:59.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3276
02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:01.080
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not territory.</v>

3277
02:07:01.410 --> 02:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>

3278
02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:05.250
<v Speaker 1>whenever it was five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made us a,</v>

3279
02:07:05.251 --> 02:07:07.020
<v Speaker 1>one of his first statements about how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>

3280
02:07:07.021 --> 02:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it was a horrible thing that the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union fell apart.</v>

3281
02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>And then a couple of years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years later,</v>

3282
02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:11.941
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3283
02:07:11.941 --> 02:07:12.774
<v Speaker 1>the troops rolled into Georgia and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>still own territory and Georgia and </v>

3284
02:07:15.361 --> 02:07:17.140
<v Speaker 1>people don't talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3285
02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:18.153
<v Speaker 1>Kazia in South [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've still got a large numbers of </v>

3286
02:07:20.461 --> 02:07:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Russian troops in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he got that.</v>

3287
02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.610
<v Speaker 1>He got Crimea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3288
02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:24.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Ukraine is for all intense </v>

3289
02:07:25.651 --> 02:07:27.720
<v Speaker 1>purposes going to become part of Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

3290
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And he's always been the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says what he means.</v>

3291
02:07:30.841 --> 02:07:34.290
<v Speaker 1>He acts in Russia's best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese are the same way.</v>

3292
02:07:34.291 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>We always seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel like that's,</v>

3293
02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3294
02:07:37.271 --> 02:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I remember times when we'd be engaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3295
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:44.740
<v Speaker 1>in some counter insurgency operation </v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas and um,</v>

3296
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.353
<v Speaker 1>we'd address him up and we'd give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and party hats and we train them </v>

3297
02:07:49.450 --> 02:07:50.950
<v Speaker 1>and then they go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning the,</v>

3298
02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3299
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>foreign service foreign military and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't act like we would write.</v>

3300
02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>There would be problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there'd be,</v>

3301
02:07:58.091 --> 02:08:00.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights abuses or whatever.</v>

3302
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Senate,</v>

3303
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 1>the Intel Committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which say,</v>

3304
02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come they're not well,</v>

3305
02:08:05.381 --> 02:08:07.090
<v Speaker 1>because they're a fucking different </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

3306
02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:09.780
<v Speaker 1>just like you talked about earlier with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East there.</v>

3307
02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:11.513
<v Speaker 1>You can dress them up and give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and training and they're always </v>

3308
02:08:13.751 --> 02:08:15.520
<v Speaker 1>going to act differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just the way the world.</v>

3309
02:08:15.521 --> 02:08:16.354
<v Speaker 1>But we never seem to quite get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like this acting in </v>

3310
02:08:18.881 --> 02:08:21.280
<v Speaker 1>your own best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always seem to be what we do it,</v>

3311
02:08:21.281 --> 02:08:22.114
<v Speaker 1>but we feel like it's unseemly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow every other nation out there is </v>

3312
02:08:24.881 --> 02:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allies and others,</v>

3313
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:27.330
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

3314
02:08:27.330 --> 02:08:28.163
<v Speaker 2>So is this a part of the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people getting access to information on </v>

3315
02:08:31.801 --> 02:08:34.110
<v Speaker 2>how the world works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As time goes on,</v>

3316
02:08:34.111 --> 02:08:34.944
<v Speaker 2>that information becomes more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible and people get more and more </v>

3317
02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:41.400
<v Speaker 2>upset about things that essentially have</v>
<v Speaker 2>always been like this?</v>

3318
02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3319
02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:44.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an interesting way to put </v>

3320
02:08:44.971 --> 02:08:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people have a problem with it,</v>

3321
02:08:46.711 --> 02:08:49.740
<v Speaker 2>but they don't offer up a solution or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3322
02:08:49.741 --> 02:08:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3323
02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:50.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3324
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.273
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument is always United States </v>

3325
02:08:52.321 --> 02:08:54.330
<v Speaker 2>should do better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be better.</v>

3326
02:08:54.331 --> 02:08:57.180
<v Speaker 2>We should inspire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are American citizens.</v>

3327
02:08:57.181 --> 02:08:58.014
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't spy on foreign leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be the shining beacon of </v>

3328
02:09:01.021 --> 02:09:04.890
<v Speaker 2>democracy and of honor throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3329
02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:05.320
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3330
02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a lovely idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we try it.</v>

3331
02:09:06.671 --> 02:09:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of going back to what I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier.</v>

3332
02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:09.471
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3333
02:09:09.471 --> 02:09:11.330
<v Speaker 1>and people would disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3334
02:09:11.331 --> 02:09:12.164
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent a lot of time overseas </v>

3335
02:09:13.791 --> 02:09:18.410
<v Speaker 1>dealing with these issues and we try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3336
02:09:18.411 --> 02:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>We don't always get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we try to do that.</v>

3337
02:09:20.421 --> 02:09:21.830
<v Speaker 1>We try to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

3338
02:09:21.831 --> 02:09:25.010
<v Speaker 1>that that bright beacon and we try to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right direction,</v>

3339
02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:26.540
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3340
02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it works and sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

3341
02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

3342
02:09:32.061 --> 02:09:32.894
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time I had a guy in a </v>

3343
02:09:34.311 --> 02:09:35.810
<v Speaker 1>foreign service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a foreign military.</v>

3344
02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:38.180
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting having a drink and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3345
02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and they've been engaged in a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

3346
02:09:41.331 --> 02:09:43.250
<v Speaker 1>And anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy says,</v>

3347
02:09:43.251 --> 02:09:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

3348
02:09:44.361 --> 02:09:45.171
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

3349
02:09:45.171 --> 02:09:47.330
<v Speaker 1>thank you for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for bringing us democracy.</v>

3350
02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And then he paused for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3351
02:09:49.041 --> 02:09:52.760
<v Speaker 1>please don't do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that was a great line.</v>

3352
02:09:52.761 --> 02:09:53.594
<v Speaker 1>I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3353
02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3354
02:09:55.670 --> 02:09:58.040
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3355
02:09:58.650 --> 02:10:02.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to bring democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democracy doesn't really work.</v>

3356
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:04.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3357
02:10:04.061 --> 02:10:05.720
<v Speaker 1>and you know what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3358
02:10:05.721 --> 02:10:06.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

3359
02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:09.020
<v Speaker 1>You end up dealing with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsavory end up dealing with,</v>

3360
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:10.550
<v Speaker 1>with countries that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3361
02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.073
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd love them to be more in step with </v>

3362
02:10:12.891 --> 02:10:14.870
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not the way,</v>

3363
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it just not the way it works.</v>

3364
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:18.343
<v Speaker 2>It seems incredibly confusing and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think anybody's ever offered up a </v>

3365
02:10:20.981 --> 02:10:21.814
<v Speaker 2>reasonable scenario where you could take</v>
<v Speaker 2>places that I liked the Middle East and </v>

3366
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:27.970
<v Speaker 2>straighten it out like no one's offered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of a step,</v>

3367
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:31.000
<v Speaker 2>like a or a program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you can say,</v>

3368
02:10:31.001 --> 02:10:32.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's where they are now.</v>

3369
02:10:32.561 --> 02:10:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Here's the rights violations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

3370
02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:39.950
<v Speaker 2>the real problems they have with </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious freedom and this is how we can</v>

3371
02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 2>get them out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can get them to a place where the</v>

3372
02:10:42.441 --> 02:10:45.050
<v Speaker 2>United States is right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people have much more freedom.</v>

3373
02:10:45.051 --> 02:10:46.430
<v Speaker 2>We know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>States isn't free.</v>

3374
02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Freedom is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an illusion.</v>

3375
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:51.870
<v Speaker 2>We're not totally free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3376
02:10:51.871 --> 02:10:53.120
<v Speaker 2>it's totally free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

3377
02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 2>there's no total freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also,</v>

3378
02:10:54.921 --> 02:10:55.754
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also because of the way the world </v>

3379
02:10:57.501 --> 02:10:57.810
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3380
02:10:57.810 --> 02:10:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

3381
02:10:58.861 --> 02:11:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to die again.</v>

3382
02:11:00.721 --> 02:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a lot of places and,</v>

3383
02:11:02.251 --> 02:11:03.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3384
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.823
<v Speaker 1>we won the lottery and I realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's coming from different </v>

3385
02:11:07.291 --> 02:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>positions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places in life and,</v>

3386
02:11:10.610 --> 02:11:12.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3387
02:11:12.271 --> 02:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucked up for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people here sometimes.</v>

3388
02:11:14.371 --> 02:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a good place to be overall.</v>

3389
02:11:18.150 --> 02:11:18.983
<v Speaker 1>And there's still as the potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it may seem far off </v>

3390
02:11:22.141 --> 02:11:22.974
<v Speaker 1>sometimes for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still the potential if you </v>

3391
02:11:24.511 --> 02:11:25.320
<v Speaker 1>work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3392
02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you can do really well in this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3393
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:28.470
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3394
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:30.510
<v Speaker 1>and even those times when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

3395
02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm just kidding myself.</v>

3396
02:11:32.041 --> 02:11:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd like to continue believing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and maybe who knows?</v>

3397
02:11:35.131 --> 02:11:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3398
02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got young kids so I'm going to,</v>

3399
02:11:38.341 --> 02:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to continue to believe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

3400
02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's true for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's complicated.</v>

3401
02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:45.210
<v Speaker 2>And I also think this is a very unusual </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3402
02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.490
<v Speaker 2>This country's only a couple hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

3403
02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>And that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to believe that.</v>

3404
02:11:49.711 --> 02:11:52.620
<v Speaker 2>We mean really essentially founded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1776.</v>

3405
02:11:52.621 --> 02:11:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>th 200 plus years is not long at all.</v>

3406
02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Hear you talking about it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>

3407
02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1776.</v>

3408
02:12:00.841 --> 02:12:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Washington knew the importance of</v>

3409
02:12:03.301 --> 02:12:04.134
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about the importance of </v>

3410
02:12:04.771 --> 02:12:06.710
<v Speaker 1>intelligence in the revolutionary war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3411
02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll probably get this wrong,</v>

3412
02:12:09.061 --> 02:12:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but the first entry into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3413
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:14.303
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call that book of </v>

3414
02:12:14.821 --> 02:12:15.740
<v Speaker 1>expenditures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3415
02:12:15.741 --> 02:12:17.570
<v Speaker 1>that the accounting book that they kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

3416
02:12:17.850 --> 02:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>basically the first entry was to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>spies.</v>

3417
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3418
02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:23.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

3419
02:12:23.911 --> 02:12:25.830
<v Speaker 1>it was to establish a spy network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

3420
02:12:25.831 --> 02:12:26.664
<v Speaker 1>outside of Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they understood even at that </v>

3421
02:12:29.221 --> 02:12:30.420
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of it.</v>

3422
02:12:30.421 --> 02:12:30.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3423
02:12:30.710 --> 02:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3424
02:12:32.201 --> 02:12:32.791
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been,</v>

3425
02:12:32.791 --> 02:12:35.310
<v Speaker 1>telephones has been people listening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3426
02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:36.773
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to check and balance that </v>

3427
02:12:38.131 --> 02:12:40.560
<v Speaker 1>and you need to ensure that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>overreaching.</v>

3428
02:12:40.561 --> 02:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I get all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3429
02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that when you do find </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point and congress enacts a law and</v>

3430
02:12:46.381 --> 02:12:47.250
<v Speaker 1>the courts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3431
02:12:47.251 --> 02:12:50.310
<v Speaker 1>go with it and say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do that then and you're jumping</v>

3432
02:12:50.311 --> 02:12:51.144
<v Speaker 1>through the hoops that have been put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and you've got to theoretically </v>

3433
02:12:54.181 --> 02:12:55.200
<v Speaker 1>again the place to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3434
02:12:55.201 --> 02:12:56.034
<v Speaker 1>you would always like to think that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have committees up on the hill that are </v>

3435
02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:03.480
<v Speaker 1>inquisitive and aggressive in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning and you know,</v>

3436
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:04.650
<v Speaker 1>are paying attention.</v>

3437
02:13:05.550 --> 02:13:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when all that is done,</v>

3438
02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:09.173
<v Speaker 1>then you'd like to think if you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>operational concern and you go through </v>

3439
02:13:11.251 --> 02:13:14.550
<v Speaker 1>those hoops that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to get the job done.</v>

3440
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Kind of bringing it back to the apple.</v>

3441
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So I think kind of in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

3442
02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:22.100
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>similarities that we have.</v>

3443
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:26.000
<v Speaker 2>On one hand we have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal utopia,</v>

3444
02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.950
<v Speaker 2>we have the shining light of honor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dignity and then you have the dire</v>

3445
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.260
<v Speaker 3>of the worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3446
02:13:34.570 --> 02:13:38.130
<v Speaker 3>And we're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're kind of in the mix,</v>

3447
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:39.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3448
02:13:39.261 --> 02:13:40.680
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of life</v>

3449
02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:43.390
<v Speaker 1>slowly off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's people it,</v>

3450
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:44.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing you learn in the </v>

3451
02:13:44.961 --> 02:13:45.794
<v Speaker 1>agency is that it's not black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing black and white about </v>

3452
02:13:48.201 --> 02:13:49.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about about the world.</v>

3453
02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:50.593
<v Speaker 1>And you learn the CIA is very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching you how to sort of exist in </v>

3454
02:13:54.551 --> 02:13:55.384
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the gray areas and understand that </v>

3455
02:13:56.241 --> 02:13:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you want.</v>

3456
02:13:58.420 --> 02:13:59.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not,</v>

3457
02:13:59.241 --> 02:14:00.074
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the beach books for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature films where they get all the </v>

3458
02:14:01.881 --> 02:14:04.940
<v Speaker 1>details and okay now it's time to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do that operation.</v>

3459
02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:06.193
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember most of the stuff that I was </v>

3460
02:14:08.121 --> 02:14:09.170
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the operations,</v>

3461
02:14:09.171 --> 02:14:10.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the back of mind you're thinking,</v>

3462
02:14:10.311 --> 02:14:11.900
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope this isn't getting fucked up.</v>

3463
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:13.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're,</v>

3464
02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wait for all the information,</v>

3465
02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you,</v>

3466
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:18.710
<v Speaker 1>before you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something bad's going to happen.</v>

3467
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:19.341
<v Speaker 1>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3468
02:14:19.341 --> 02:14:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a fucking go up.</v>

3469
02:14:20.781 --> 02:14:22.520
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get off the exit a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

3470
02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:25.160
<v Speaker 1>And usually that's before you have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>full comfort.</v>

3471
02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:28.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they teach you very well how to do that,</v>

3472
02:14:28.671 --> 02:14:31.910
<v Speaker 1>how to do risk versus gain calculations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to figure out,</v>

3473
02:14:31.911 --> 02:14:33.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're going to have to,</v>

3474
02:14:33.150 --> 02:14:36.980
<v Speaker 1>but you got to make a decision at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point the world like it to be,</v>

3475
02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:37.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3476
02:14:37.911 --> 02:14:38.744
<v Speaker 1>sort of a zero risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we always talk about counter </v>

3477
02:14:40.041 --> 02:14:40.761
<v Speaker 1>terrorism and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3478
02:14:40.761 --> 02:14:42.590
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to get this over with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>

3479
02:14:42.710 --> 02:14:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>

3480
02:14:44.670 --> 02:14:47.750
<v Speaker 3>and you evolve as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3481
02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.550
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what it's going to cry.</v>

3482
02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:53.750
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have to come down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something pretty fucking astronomical to</v>

3483
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:55.830
<v Speaker 3>have no more violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more crime,</v>

3484
02:14:55.831 --> 02:14:57.600
<v Speaker 3>no more espionage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more,</v>

3485
02:14:58.170 --> 02:14:59.760
<v Speaker 3>no more hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3486
02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:00.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3487
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.690
<v Speaker 3>you know what I suspect I didn't in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your lifetime.</v>

3488
02:15:03.691 --> 02:15:05.130
<v Speaker 3>In my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3489
02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:06.420
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so disappointing.</v>

3490
02:15:06.930 --> 02:15:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I give everybody?</v>

3491
02:15:08.401 --> 02:15:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might do the trick.</v>

3492
02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3493
02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Mike Baker for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give everybody mushrooms.</v>

3494
02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:18.330
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your tagline.</v>

3495
02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:19.920
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be president.</v>

3496
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:20.783
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to be fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I really think we should get rid of </v>

3497
02:15:22.381 --> 02:15:24.120
<v Speaker 3>presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would we have instead?</v>

3498
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:25.103
<v Speaker 3>I think a giant committee of super </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent people that aren't entirely </v>

3499
02:15:28.651 --> 02:15:29.820
<v Speaker 3>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

3500
02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:30.654
<v Speaker 3>not one figurehead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that figurehead is a primate </v>

3501
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:33.564
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we always want the one alpha </v>

3502
02:15:34.891 --> 02:15:36.480
<v Speaker 3>primate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a big silver back.</v>

3503
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wanting to watch the whole leader of</v>

3504
02:15:39.121 --> 02:15:39.954
<v Speaker 3>the tribe thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that shit just can't work with 300 </v>

3505
02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.040
<v Speaker 3>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just too crazy.</v>

3506
02:15:44.041 --> 02:15:48.420
<v Speaker 3>And they all go gray so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get so fucking old man.</v>

3507
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:51.390
<v Speaker 3>There's so much pressure on those guys.</v>

3508
02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3509
02:15:52.151 --> 02:15:53.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what it's,</v>

3510
02:15:53.041 --> 02:15:54.730
<v Speaker 1>it's also uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3511
02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:55.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean yeah,</v>

3512
02:15:56.490 --> 02:15:57.291
<v Speaker 3>President Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3513
02:15:57.291 --> 02:16:00.710
<v Speaker 3>He writes a good looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smooth faced,</v>

3514
02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:01.753
<v Speaker 3>handsome young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrant looking guy and now he light </v>

3515
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:05.190
<v Speaker 3>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3516
02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its face has fallen off his bones.</v>

3517
02:16:07.731 --> 02:16:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy,</v>

3518
02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.430
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks so tired.</v>

3519
02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slept in years.</v>

3520
02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Say It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of that job.</v>

3521
02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3522
02:16:17.511 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 1>someone who has always shouldered it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is always watching it,</v>

3523
02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:22.140
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wasn't it a different weight?</v>

3524
02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Was it different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was</v>

3525
02:16:26.650 --> 02:16:28.740
<v Speaker 1>dealing with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recession,</v>

3526
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dealing with world war two.</v>

3527
02:16:31.091 --> 02:16:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's always been,</v>

3528
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:35.560
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a terrible job.</v>

3529
02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Terrible job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it.</v>

3530
02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that the biggest problem now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of information,</v>

3531
02:16:39.761 --> 02:16:42.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's a fucking journalist on,</v>

3532
02:16:42.710 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 1>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3533
02:16:43.991 --> 02:16:47.290
<v Speaker 1>everybody's a judge and jury and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the speed of information,</v>

3534
02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody bothers to check facts anymore.</v>

3535
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's racing to get ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news cycle,</v>

3536
02:16:52.481 --> 02:16:54.730
<v Speaker 1>which exists in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in minutes now instead of hours.</v>

3537
02:16:54.731 --> 02:16:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember we used to be white,</v>

3538
02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the five o'clock news,</v>

3539
02:16:57.551 --> 02:17:01.060
<v Speaker 1>the 11 o'clock news all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journalist had time to check their facts</v>

3540
02:17:01.061 --> 02:17:01.894
<v Speaker 1>and their stories and their sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just had that one newscast </v>

3541
02:17:04.081 --> 02:17:08.440
<v Speaker 1>or two newscasts in the evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now let's fucking throw it out there</v>

3542
02:17:08.441 --> 02:17:09.340
<v Speaker 1>and hope that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3543
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:10.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't get it wrong.</v>

3544
02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:13.870
<v Speaker 1>So I think that weighs on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on anybody who's in politics.</v>

3545
02:17:14.130 --> 02:17:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it serves a good purpose as well.</v>

3546
02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

3547
02:17:17.291 --> 02:17:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it keeps them more honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3548
02:17:18.821 --> 02:17:20.080
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3549
02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:21.213
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that has something to do with </v>

3550
02:17:21.731 --> 02:17:22.564
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at Obama then and now look at </v>

3551
02:17:23.771 --> 02:17:24.850
<v Speaker 1>this photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3552
02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

3553
02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:31.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a 20 year difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a 20 year difference in less than</v>

3554
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:36.301
<v Speaker 1>eight years to 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 1>January,</v>

3555
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:39.050
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can throw up like a seven year split</v>

3556
02:17:39.051 --> 02:17:42.910
<v Speaker 1>on trump now and see what trump will </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like after seven years in office is</v>

3557
02:17:42.911 --> 02:17:46.640
<v Speaker 1>going to look like Jabba the hut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His face is already fighting gravity.</v>

3558
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poor guy.</v>

3559
02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I so rich to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3560
02:17:51.381 --> 02:17:53.900
<v Speaker 1>What are you eating then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them are healthy.</v>

3561
02:17:53.901 --> 02:17:56.390
<v Speaker 1>How about Bernie Sanders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie's Bernie Sanders is going to look</v>

3562
02:17:56.391 --> 02:17:57.710
<v Speaker 1>like a question mark.</v>

3563
02:17:57.710 --> 02:18:00.710
<v Speaker 1>He's going to like Ben completely over </v>
<v Speaker 1>his posture.</v>

3564
02:18:00.711 --> 02:18:02.720
<v Speaker 1>So awful already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone should teach.</v>

3565
02:18:02.721 --> 02:18:04.760
<v Speaker 1>That guy had a stand up straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not that old,</v>

3566
02:18:04.761 --> 02:18:06.110
<v Speaker 1>much older than Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3567
02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.880
<v Speaker 1>He's only a couple of years older than </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

3568
02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:08.773
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3569
02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Well she's not holding up that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't look good.</v>

3570
02:18:10.911 --> 02:18:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they did this bill.</v>

3571
02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:12.710
<v Speaker 1>You look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look out,</v>

3572
02:18:12.710 --> 02:18:13.550
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3573
02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rolled him out.</v>

3574
02:18:15.231 --> 02:18:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I think they realized right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>

3575
02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't he have,</v>

3576
02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:20.600
<v Speaker 1>he had like some serious heart surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3577
02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

3578
02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:22.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's a smart son of a bitch and he </v>

3579
02:18:23.121 --> 02:18:23.830
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3580
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:25.910
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was fortunate in a lot of ways.</v>

3581
02:18:25.911 --> 02:18:27.110
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he governed well and he,</v>

3582
02:18:27.130 --> 02:18:28.210
<v Speaker 1>he understood the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3583
02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:29.053
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of compromise and </v>

3584
02:18:29.931 --> 02:18:30.940
<v Speaker 1>negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3585
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And that was still at a time when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do that.</v>

3586
02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:34.093
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether it's still </v>

3587
02:18:34.701 --> 02:18:35.511
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3588
02:18:35.511 --> 02:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the shit that comes out of that,</v>

3589
02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:40.310
<v Speaker 1>the Capitol Hill where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3590
02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:41.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it Scalia is barely dead and people are </v>

3591
02:18:43.281 --> 02:18:45.380
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to listen to anybody who</v>

3592
02:18:45.381 --> 02:18:46.670
<v Speaker 1>gets proposed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3593
02:18:46.671 --> 02:18:48.170
<v Speaker 1>come in here and replace them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

3594
02:18:48.171 --> 02:18:50.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably could have held off on that</v>

3595
02:18:50.031 --> 02:18:50.864
<v Speaker 1>statement for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats were so excited to get a </v>

3596
02:18:53.121 --> 02:18:54.590
<v Speaker 1>liberal in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3597
02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Bama can appoint a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3598
02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:57.273
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's throwing a left curve and </v>

3599
02:18:59.421 --> 02:18:59.721
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3600
02:18:59.721 --> 02:19:00.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3601
02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:01.513
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody who is a Republican and </v>

3602
02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what he said?</v>

3603
02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:05.901
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3604
02:19:05.901 --> 02:19:07.220
<v Speaker 1>What's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what the guy's name is.</v>

3605
02:19:07.221 --> 02:19:12.221
<v Speaker 1>He's a former governor and is a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about hope and change and now we've</v>

3606
02:19:12.981 --> 02:19:14.300
<v Speaker 1>got to get Bernie in there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

3607
02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:16.010
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll hold the flag.</v>

3608
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I love to go camping when Obama just </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent a week with them just to get drunk</v>

3609
02:19:20.391 --> 02:19:22.350
<v Speaker 1>with them every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tell me every day.</v>

3610
02:19:22.351 --> 02:19:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

3611
02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:27.650
<v Speaker 1>What does that kid like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy is only three or four older than</v>

3612
02:19:27.651 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3613
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:29.960
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be a good feeling to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that last day.</v>

3614
02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:30.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this probably,</v>

3615
02:19:30.771 --> 02:19:32.650
<v Speaker 3>there's obviously a lot of sadness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of worry about,</v>

3616
02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:33.950
<v Speaker 3>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to be remembered?</v>

3617
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:36.680
<v Speaker 3>But that last fucking day when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally get to hand over the keys,</v>

3618
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:38.650
<v Speaker 3>get the hell out of there and go have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3619
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:39.523
<v Speaker 3>a few pops and not have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 3>waking up in the middle of the night </v>

3620
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:42.950
<v Speaker 3>because some disasters going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3621
02:19:42.951 --> 02:19:45.140
<v Speaker 3>but he's still got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows too much.</v>

3622
02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.100
<v Speaker 3>So the consequences of all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>

3623
02:19:47.101 --> 02:19:50.090
<v Speaker 3>you've got to been weighing on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these pieces that are in play,</v>

3624
02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:53.360
<v Speaker 3>where are they going to wind up in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>book or the book deal,</v>

3625
02:19:53.361 --> 02:19:54.194
<v Speaker 3>a book deal and his own conscience mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also the fact that he's got to </v>

3626
02:20:00.471 --> 02:20:03.170
<v Speaker 3>have secret service for the rest of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3627
02:20:03.410 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 3>He was driving around and bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars forever.</v>

3628
02:20:05.781 --> 02:20:06.614
<v Speaker 3>That guy can't go to the fucking mall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd give up your right to go to the </v>

3629
02:20:09.141 --> 02:20:10.010
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3630
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't mind if I didn't ever go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mall again.</v>

3631
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.903
<v Speaker 3>Quite frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be pressing if that means I can't </v>

3632
02:20:15.321 --> 02:20:18.140
<v Speaker 3>go back into a mall so much he can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3633
02:20:18.250 --> 02:20:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I know you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go to the ball game,</v>

3634
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 3>buy a ticket at the last minute and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and just sit in the bleachers.</v>

3635
02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:23.153
<v Speaker 3>You imagine if you do that and say Obama</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes and sits down next to you with a </v>

3636
02:20:25.341 --> 02:20:30.341
<v Speaker 3>dog and a pretzel and it's a Co parent </v>
<v Speaker 3>who would be sell feed Nachos.</v>

3637
02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would swarm him.</v>

3638
02:20:32.091 --> 02:20:35.350
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't have secret service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would smother him with selfies till</v>

3639
02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:36.203
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no air and suffocate died of </v>

3640
02:20:38.331 --> 02:20:39.410
<v Speaker 3>selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3641
02:20:39.411 --> 02:20:40.244
<v Speaker 3>you probably should have held off on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole selfie thing when they was in the </v>

3642
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.870
<v Speaker 3>White House.</v>

3643
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:42.703
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be fair that walking around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>White House with a selfie stick was at </v>

3644
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:48.020
<v Speaker 3>and selfie sticks or unpresidential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3645
02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I think there's certain things you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't do and whether it's him or</v>

3646
02:20:51.831 --> 02:20:54.390
<v Speaker 3>whether it's any other president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

3647
02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 3>there's something to be said for </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining the dignity,</v>

3648
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:59.160
<v Speaker 3>the dignity of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an office there.</v>

3649
02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:00.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There to fucking take a selfie just by </v>

3650
02:21:06.231 --> 02:21:10.870
<v Speaker 3>yourself and you need a camera to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just seems weird that I uh,</v>

3651
02:21:11.410 --> 02:21:13.310
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's odd.</v>

3652
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Speaker 3>And what a sign of the Times that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3653
02:21:15.261 --> 02:21:16.094
<v Speaker 3>Seen him there with a magic wand where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking phone and well did you see </v>

3654
02:21:18.651 --> 02:21:19.484
<v Speaker 3>him before when he was like a pure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the corner with his sunglasses </v>

3655
02:21:21.141 --> 02:21:23.570
<v Speaker 3>but tending to be James Bond and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what also,</v>

3656
02:21:23.571 --> 02:21:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I bet he has the iphone six and not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>six plus because they,</v>

3657
02:21:27.921 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 3>well we don't want you to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>excessive,</v>

3658
02:21:30.171 --> 02:21:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Mr President.</v>

3659
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:33.410
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go with a smaller phone.</v>

3660
02:21:33.411 --> 02:21:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Preston.</v>

3661
02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:37.760
<v Speaker 3>A little bit more approachable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want you outrageous like I want</v>

3662
02:21:37.761 --> 02:21:39.340
<v Speaker 3>a viper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't try the viper.</v>

3663
02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Not Fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an American car.</v>

3664
02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.300
<v Speaker 3>I can never have a fight for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine.</v>

3665
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Drove a viper on at Ford 158 corvette </v>
<v Speaker 3>convertible.</v>

3666
02:21:49.310 --> 02:21:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking big elvis sunglasses.</v>

3667
02:21:51.651 --> 02:21:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid you fucks.</v>

3668
02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:55.593
<v Speaker 3>If it was me and I finished up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would drive away from the White House </v>

3669
02:21:57.621 --> 02:21:59.560
<v Speaker 3>in my last day in an El Camino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3670
02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.940
<v Speaker 3>this is the fact that drives my wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

3671
02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:04.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always always wanted an El Camino.</v>

3672
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I've always kept my eye out for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

3673
02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:09.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give me an El Camino every year.</v>

3674
02:22:09.930 --> 02:22:10.763
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was manufactured and I would be a </v>

3675
02:22:12.081 --> 02:22:15.730
<v Speaker 3>happy boy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

3790
02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:48.790
<v Speaker 3>they've done a good job of trying to </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd run out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in a hurry yet jumped in and I </v>

3845
02:28:42.981 --> 02:28:47.981
<v Speaker 1>think anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my faculty out there,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3848
02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember part of it is,</v>

3849
02:28:54.531 --> 02:28:55.364
<v Speaker 1>I remember as a kid I had know I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great hot wheels collection and I </v>

3850
02:28:59.901 --> 02:29:01.850
<v Speaker 1>remember the El Camino was one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorites back then.</v>

3851
02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me it looks like a pickup truck.</v>

3852
02:29:04.581 --> 02:29:05.730

3854
02:29:06.481 --> 02:29:07.490

<v Speaker 1>I could have Chevelle.</v>

3856

<v Speaker 1>My Dad had a chevy that had the rear </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing wagon seat and we also used to </v>

3906
02:31:08.421 --> 02:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>fight with me and my brothers would </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight over it and you know,</v>

3907
02:31:10.941 --> 02:31:12.620
<v Speaker 1>we literally would go to the officer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

3908
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:14.760
<v Speaker 1>My Dad would have a few drinks and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pile,</v>

3909
02:31:14.761 --> 02:31:15.890
<v Speaker 1>all the kids back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

3910
02:31:15.891 --> 02:31:19.560
<v Speaker 1>in the Chevy wagon and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and barrel down the highway as we're all</v>

3911
02:31:19.561 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 1>flying back</v>

3912
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.350
<v Speaker 3>and forth over the seats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>argue with each other and fighting about</v>

3913
02:31:22.351 --> 02:31:25.080
<v Speaker 3>who gets the rear facing seats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was not a fucking seat belt to</v>

3914
02:31:25.081 --> 02:31:25.914
<v Speaker 3>be had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you remember those Toyota land </v>

3915
02:31:27.631 --> 02:31:28.464
<v Speaker 3>cruisers that had the seats that face </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other side facing Jay's Fj he's </v>

3916
02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:35.580
<v Speaker 3>forties what it we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3917
02:31:35.581 --> 02:31:36.750
<v Speaker 3>it was Fj 40 right.</v>

3918
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

3919
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:40.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not that long ago that they,</v>

3920
02:31:40.100 --> 02:31:41.760
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had those in the,</v>

3921
02:31:41.761 --> 02:31:43.950
<v Speaker 1>in the Land Rovers for years and years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and years.</v>

3922
02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:46.120
<v Speaker 1>And including,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3923
02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were still building those things in</v>

3924
02:31:48.391 --> 02:31:49.200
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3925
02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that long ago.</v>

3926
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an option on a cause.</v>

3927
02:31:53.551 --> 02:31:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I got a like got a land rover one time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was probably okay to be fair,</v>

3928
02:31:57.931 --> 02:31:59.820
<v Speaker 1>it's more than 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably 15 years ago,</v>

3929
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:00.833
<v Speaker 1>but I remember that was an option to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the the back seats face and I </v>

3930
02:32:03.871 --> 02:32:05.790
<v Speaker 1>thought well at what point am I ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to use these?</v>

3931
02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:06.893
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the F's Fj 40 but that was way </v>

3932
02:32:08.821 --> 02:32:09.654
<v Speaker 3>more than 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the F Z J 80 was a classic Land </v>

3933
02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:15.593
<v Speaker 3>Rover and now I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they stopped making that 97 or </v>

3934
02:32:19.411 --> 02:32:20.244
<v Speaker 3>98 and that's a classic one because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a solid front and rear axle and </v>

3935
02:32:24.721 --> 02:32:27.000
<v Speaker 3>those motherfuckers can drive over </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3936
02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:28.430
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3937
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:32.790
<v Speaker 3>to this day people refurbish them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Land cruisers are a great vehicle to see</v>

3938
02:32:32.791 --> 02:32:33.600
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those,</v>

3939
02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:35.100
<v Speaker 3>we used to put those things to all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

3940
02:32:35.101 --> 02:32:37.160
<v Speaker 3>she'll come up in London special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3941
02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:40.890
<v Speaker 3>All the Taliban had those land cruisers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they never broke down.</v>

3942
02:32:40.891 --> 02:32:41.724
<v Speaker 3>You build that exhaust pipe up over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of the roof for the crossing the </v>

3943
02:32:44.191 --> 02:32:47.010
<v Speaker 3>fjords,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fjords towards in the desert,</v>

3944
02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:50.130
<v Speaker 3>the fjords,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snorkel,</v>

3945
02:32:50.131 --> 02:32:52.770
<v Speaker 3>the desert snorkel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the safari snorkel.</v>

3946
02:32:52.771 --> 02:32:53.604
<v Speaker 3>They would call it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've just released more documents </v>

3947
02:32:55.591 --> 02:32:56.424
<v Speaker 3>from bin Laden.</v>

3948
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.943
<v Speaker 3>More documented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The CIA released about 110 documents </v>

3949
02:33:00.451 --> 02:33:01.740
<v Speaker 3>from the bin Laden raid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3950
02:33:01.741 --> 02:33:03.750
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was also about like what he wanted to</v>

3951
02:33:03.751 --> 02:33:05.430
<v Speaker 3>do with his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died.</v>

3952
02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:09.720
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a will for his $29 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had 29 million when he died.</v>

3953
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised.</v>

3954
02:33:10.641 --> 02:33:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised he didn't have more.</v>

3955
02:33:11.611 --> 02:33:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's days dad was worth billions.</v>

3956
02:33:14.010 --> 02:33:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is weird that he was living in some</v>

3957
02:33:15.661 --> 02:33:19.200
<v Speaker 3>fucking strange compound and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of knew it.</v>

3958
02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:20.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3959
02:33:20.101 --> 02:33:20.934
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3960
02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Well it was bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't done it tonight.</v>

3961
02:33:23.121 --> 02:33:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Should we didn't fight Osama I that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3962
02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:26.303
<v Speaker 3>you're kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was in that weird compound in </v>

3963
02:33:28.681 --> 02:33:30.490
<v Speaker 3>that ha like hiding out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3964
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.940
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange.</v>

3965
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And we got lucky because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was looking to move.</v>

3966
02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:35.813
<v Speaker 1>It was looking to get on the move again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably sensed in part </v>

3967
02:33:38.191 --> 02:33:40.230
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd had some problems with one of the,</v>

3968
02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:44.280
<v Speaker 1>one of the facilitators that he had and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was looking actually to,</v>

3969
02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:45.153
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace one of his people that </v>

3970
02:33:46.651 --> 02:33:47.484
<v Speaker 1>actually dealt with them sort of as </v>
<v Speaker 1>liaison guy between the Pakistanis and </v>

3971
02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:53.790
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda and him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

3972
02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:54.624
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3973
02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:56.410
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we held off,</v>

3974
02:33:56.490 --> 02:33:59.730
<v Speaker 1>if we hadn't found him and then only had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month to plan,</v>

3975
02:34:00.090 --> 02:34:00.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3976
02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it could have gone completely the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3977
02:34:02.401 --> 02:34:06.300
<v Speaker 1>We could have shown up and it would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been an empty place because he was,</v>

3978
02:34:06.301 --> 02:34:09.510
<v Speaker 1>he was actively looking to move to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different location.</v>

3979
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of funny that the way they had</v>

3980
02:34:11.871 --> 02:34:15.470
<v Speaker 3>to do it was doing in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>night land helicopters,</v>

3981
02:34:15.471 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 3>one of them crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>break and then</v>

3982
02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:20.050
<v Speaker 1>shoot him that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What really,</v>

3983
02:34:20.051 --> 02:34:22.810
<v Speaker 1>they knew where the house was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were really evil,</v>

3984
02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:26.020
<v Speaker 1>if we were able yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop one right on that house and fucking</v>

3985
02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:28.030
<v Speaker 1>incinerate and they talked about that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scenario.</v>

3986
02:34:28.031 --> 02:34:29.140
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decision was looking,</v>

3987
02:34:29.141 --> 02:34:29.974
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's women and children in there and </v>

3988
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:32.980
<v Speaker 1>how many people were in the house with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>

3989
02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.040
<v Speaker 1>He had his extended family with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd effect,</v>

3990
02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:35.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

3991
02:34:37.690 --> 02:34:38.830
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3992
02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight plus guards,</v>

3993
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:43.090
<v Speaker 1>but the women and children were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

3994
02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and the decision was made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3995
02:34:44.111 --> 02:34:44.980
<v Speaker 1>we can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>

3996
02:34:44.981 --> 02:34:45.814
<v Speaker 1>we can't fire a rocket down there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't want to take out all </v>

3997
02:34:47.771 --> 02:34:49.750
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an indication,</v>

3998
02:34:49.810 --> 02:34:50.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3999
02:34:50.531 --> 02:34:51.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are to say,</v>

4000
02:34:51.161 --> 02:34:51.851
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

4001
02:34:51.851 --> 02:34:54.030
<v Speaker 1>You just want to go after the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

4002
02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:56.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do the right thing.</v>

4003
02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:01.320
<v Speaker 1>So to signing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insanely complex operation like that,</v>

4004
02:35:01.870 --> 02:35:04.390
<v Speaker 1>just to save those people that were with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him essentially.</v>

4005
02:35:04.410 --> 02:35:05.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to do,</v>

4006
02:35:05.081 --> 02:35:07.330
<v Speaker 1>and to do the right thing and the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being,</v>

4007
02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:08.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can,</v>

4008
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:12.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can recover them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can actually died in that rate.</v>

4009
02:35:12.221 --> 02:35:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Or other people do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4010
02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Guards died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4011
02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see photos of them?</v>

4012
02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Did they let you look at the photos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A body allegedly?</v>

4013
02:35:21.850 --> 02:35:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Is Anybody listening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4014
02:35:23.140 --> 02:35:24.010
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4015
02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just between you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't know.</v>

4016
02:35:26.261 --> 02:35:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you did,</v>

4017
02:35:30.090 --> 02:35:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you could do something to let me know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you did.</v>

4018
02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:33.093
<v Speaker 1>You could just to like just my last act </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird act like you're trying to hide </v>

<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

4021
02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:44.133
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a insanely complex </v>

4022
02:35:45.251 --> 02:35:46.210
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4026
02:35:49.401 --> 02:35:51.730
<v Speaker 1>of the facility of the [inaudible] </v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4028
02:35:52.931 --> 02:35:53.764
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about before muscle </v>

4029
02:35:54.521 --> 02:35:55.380
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4030
02:35:55.410 --> 02:35:56.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking steps do I have to go </v>

4031
02:35:58.540 --> 02:35:59.373
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many steps do I have to get to the </v>

4032
02:36:00.371 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 1>end of this wall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4033
02:36:01.361 --> 02:36:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to know exactly how is places </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out,</v>

4034
02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:06.790
<v Speaker 1>where he could possibly be and how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that?</v>

4035
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:07.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4036
02:36:07.361 --> 02:36:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all that work.</v>

4037
02:36:08.561 --> 02:36:11.860
<v Speaker 1>People think that somehow we just rocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on his place.</v>

4038
02:36:11.861 --> 02:36:12.694
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was eight plus years of insane </v>

4039
02:36:15.251 --> 02:36:20.251
<v Speaker 1>effort trying to locate him and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirm it was him and then,</v>

4040
02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>design this operation.</v>

4041
02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:26.560
<v Speaker 1>And so there were a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of moving parts.</v>

4042
02:36:26.561 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just like we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look great.</v>

4043
02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:29.523
<v Speaker 1>Now we got them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was an impressive that he was </v>

4044
02:36:30.791 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 1>able to hide for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4045
02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a lot of,</v>

4046
02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:34.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplices and mainly like the </v>

4047
02:36:36.851 --> 02:36:37.684
<v Speaker 1>Pakistani Intel service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incredibly duplicitous had someone </v>

4048
02:36:42.701 --> 02:36:43.620
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4049
02:36:43.650 --> 02:36:47.860
<v Speaker 1>as his liaison officer within the packy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Intel Service and,</v>

4050
02:36:48.910 --> 02:36:50.320
<v Speaker 1>and there were a lot of people yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4051
02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:51.173
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a very invested interest in making </v>

4052
02:36:53.171 --> 02:36:54.360
<v Speaker 1>sure that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4053
02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:55.323
<v Speaker 1>stayed hidden.</v>

4054
02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4055
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:58.383
<v Speaker 1>I know people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4056
02:36:58.390 --> 02:36:59.860
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tall bearded dude.</v>

4057
02:36:59.890 --> 02:37:01.510
<v Speaker 1>You should've been able to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4058
02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.700
<v Speaker 1>it ain't that easy and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

4059
02:37:04.930 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not as easy as it in the feature </v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

4060
02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:08.890
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

4061
02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:09.753
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

4062
02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I know that's disappointing for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to hear.</v>

4063
02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:12.753
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4064
02:37:12.850 --> 02:37:13.683
<v Speaker 1>it was a great operation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that they've released these </v>

4065
02:37:16.251 --> 02:37:17.300
<v Speaker 1>documents and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4066
02:37:17.301 --> 02:37:19.520
<v Speaker 1>at this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>

4067
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:20.743
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating to see kind of inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mind a little bit more and </v>

4068
02:37:23.661 --> 02:37:24.494
<v Speaker 1>understand to what degree he did or </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a sort of operational </v>

4069
02:37:27.891 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what al Qaeda was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

4070
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4071
02:37:31.251 --> 02:37:32.084
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those of you that are looking for </v>

4072
02:37:33.561 --> 02:37:36.470
<v Speaker 1>something to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

4073
02:37:36.471 --> 02:37:37.460
<v Speaker 1>dark 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that move,</v>

4074
02:37:37.490 --> 02:37:40.940
<v Speaker 1>how accurate was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4075
02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:43.570
<v Speaker 1>they make day people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4076
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.900
<v Speaker 2>The girl who was in charge of everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>and telling navy seals.</v>

4077
02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a composite of people.</v>

4078
02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:51.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Hollywood does,</v>

4079
02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:53.140
<v Speaker 1>they do some things really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

4080
02:37:53.141 --> 02:37:55.480
<v Speaker 1>They do the military a recreation's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

4081
02:37:55.481 --> 02:37:56.251
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4082
02:37:56.251 --> 02:37:57.084
<v Speaker 1>he's incredibly well and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they take bits and pieces and </v>

4083
02:38:01.451 --> 02:38:03.040
<v Speaker 1>turn them into a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4084
02:38:03.041 --> 02:38:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Which is what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

4085
02:38:04.241 --> 02:38:05.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the nature of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4086
02:38:05.410 --> 02:38:09.400
<v Speaker 2>A dramatic representation of what kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of went on,</v>

4087
02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:10.300
<v Speaker 2>but not really</v>

4088
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:11.383
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juicy or so they have to make an entry </v>

4089
02:38:12.151 --> 02:38:13.820
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to condense it down.</v>

4090
02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:15.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

4091
02:38:15.370 --> 02:38:16.203
<v Speaker 1>if you showed what actually happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience kill themselves out of </v>

4092
02:38:18.561 --> 02:38:20.410
<v Speaker 1>boredom because you'd be watching eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years worth of,</v>

4093
02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:21.493
<v Speaker 1>of surveillance in eight years worth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling and understand what one </v>

4094
02:38:23.481 --> 02:38:26.840
<v Speaker 1>credit card receipt meant in relation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was happening over across</v>

4095
02:38:26.841 --> 02:38:27.674
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things that go into this that </v>

4096
02:38:29.841 --> 02:38:31.610
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever sees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

4097
02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:32.031
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4098
02:38:32.031 --> 02:38:33.890
<v Speaker 1>they condense it down and it turns into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie and then,</v>

4099
02:38:34.370 --> 02:38:35.091
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4100
02:38:35.091 --> 02:38:38.750
<v Speaker 1>up on the hill in Capitol Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get confused and they don't realize</v>

4101
02:38:38.751 --> 02:38:40.700
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a movie,</v>

4102
02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:41.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they,</v>

4103
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kerfuffle they had after they released </v>

4104
02:38:45.261 --> 02:38:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it where they called them back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4105
02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe over the interrogation program,</v>

4106
02:38:49.401 --> 02:38:51.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe you didn't tell us everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4107
02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:51.980
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4108
02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:53.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just made a fucking movie.</v>

4109
02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:54.111
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4110
02:38:54.111 --> 02:38:56.870
<v Speaker 1>because there were people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset with zero,</v>

4111
02:38:56.871 --> 02:38:57.704
<v Speaker 1>dark 30 because I thought it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it put too much importance on </v>

4112
02:38:59.781 --> 02:39:00.614
<v Speaker 1>interrogation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were people that thought it </v>

4113
02:39:01.341 --> 02:39:04.700
<v Speaker 1>didn't put enough importance and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking it's a fucking movie.</v>

4114
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:05.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4115
02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.950
<v Speaker 1>part of it's just entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4116
02:39:06.951 --> 02:39:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not watching a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

4117
02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:11.790
<v Speaker 2>well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a movie that they made,</v>

4118
02:39:11.791 --> 02:39:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4119
02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Fox catcher movie that's based on Mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>and David Schultz.</v>

4120
02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:18.893
<v Speaker 2>The wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4121
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.943
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That movie is just filled with bullshit </v>

4122
02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:24.930
<v Speaker 2>and it's a real problem for Mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>Schultz,</v>

4123
02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:25.793
<v Speaker 2>who was an Olympic gold medalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best wrestlers the United </v>

4124
02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:30.810
<v Speaker 2>States has ever produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

4125
02:39:30.811 --> 02:39:32.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's that guy's alive.</v>

4126
02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:33.773
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His brother got shot by that crazy </v>

4127
02:39:34.591 --> 02:39:35.424
<v Speaker 2>dupont fuck right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But mark's alive and they changed all </v>

4128
02:39:38.971 --> 02:39:41.220
<v Speaker 2>sorts of Shit in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

4129
02:39:41.370 --> 02:39:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Historical Shit about his career as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler,</v>

4130
02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:47.130
<v Speaker 2>his career as a UFC fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put the,</v>

4131
02:39:47.131 --> 02:39:50.730
<v Speaker 2>they even changed the time where the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>was invented.</v>

4132
02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:51.833
<v Speaker 2>They made the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made him watch the UFC like almost </v>

4133
02:39:56.491 --> 02:40:00.780
<v Speaker 2>like six or seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think before it ever really existed.</v>

4134
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:04.170
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy he watched fight,</v>

4135
02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:06.390
<v Speaker 2>was it historical character?</v>

4136
02:40:06.390 --> 02:40:07.223
<v Speaker 2>Big Daddy Goodrich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Good rich was one of the original </v>

4137
02:40:10.171 --> 02:40:15.171
<v Speaker 2>pioneers of MMA and he in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching Gary Goodrich fight,</v>

4138
02:40:15.301 --> 02:40:16.134
<v Speaker 2>Paul Herrera when in reality he fought </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Goodrich and his first UFC fight </v>

4139
02:40:21.090 --> 02:40:24.990
<v Speaker 2>also in the movie Mark Schultz is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting in the UFC.</v>

4140
02:40:24.991 --> 02:40:29.880
<v Speaker 2>In his first fight he's fighting in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>small organization and it's like kind of</v>

4141
02:40:29.881 --> 02:40:32.790
<v Speaker 2>sad and he's fighting a white Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

4142
02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:35.610
<v Speaker 2>He fought a black guy named Gary </v>
<v Speaker 2>Goodrich.</v>

4143
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Gary Good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a historical figure.</v>

4144
02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:38.693
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's historical fact in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of mixed martial arts than Mark </v>

4145
02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:43.613
<v Speaker 2>Schultz was like one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>talents from wrestling to ever compete </v>

4146
02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:49.800
<v Speaker 2>in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gary Goodrich was a real pioneer.</v>

4147
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.823
<v Speaker 2>A guy was very dangerous and mark took </v>
<v Speaker 2>them down at will and it was kind of </v>

4148
02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:57.030
<v Speaker 2>crazy to watch like how good of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler he was.</v>

4149
02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:58.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie they bullshit their way </v>

4150
02:40:58.921 --> 02:40:59.580
<v Speaker 2>through all that.</v>

4151
02:40:59.580 --> 02:41:01.040
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary was there.</v>

4152
02:41:01.230 --> 02:41:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Was there somebody who served as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consultant,</v>

4153
02:41:03.210 --> 02:41:04.043
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mark went crazy after the movie's </v>

4154
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:06.023
<v Speaker 2>released and one of those twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>rampage and we were supposed to do a </v>

4155
02:41:08.131 --> 02:41:09.540
<v Speaker 2>podcast about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>

4156
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:11.610
<v Speaker 2>he's an odd guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4157
02:41:11.730 --> 02:41:12.690
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4158
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:15.720
<v Speaker 2>he's very elusive and he's talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it and I said,</v>

4159
02:41:15.721 --> 02:41:16.980
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me know when you want to do it.</v>

4160
02:41:16.981 --> 02:41:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll fly you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about it.</v>

4161
02:41:18.361 --> 02:41:21.150
<v Speaker 2>But he went on this rampage about it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

4162
02:41:21.151 --> 02:41:21.984
<v Speaker 2>And then someone compiled a website </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they talked about all the things </v>

4163
02:41:25.501 --> 02:41:26.334
<v Speaker 2>that they got wrong in that movie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff they made up in that </v>

4164
02:41:28.651 --> 02:41:33.530
<v Speaker 2>movie to make it more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the story itself is fascinating that</v>

4165
02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:34.610
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>

4166
02:41:34.610 --> 02:41:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but he releases a story or anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4167
02:41:36.451 --> 02:41:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signs over something or anybody,</v>

4168
02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it picks up a book and says,</v>

4169
02:41:39.811 --> 02:41:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a movie out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4170
02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:42.860
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4171
02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it becomes an editorial process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying,</v>

4172
02:41:44.841 --> 02:41:46.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does raw intelligence get out of the</v>

4173
02:41:46.461 --> 02:41:48.260
<v Speaker 1>field and then suddenly becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not,</v>

4174
02:41:48.261 --> 02:41:49.094
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets into this editing process and </v>

4175
02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:52.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bunch of people taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whack at it,</v>

4176
02:41:52.730 --> 02:41:53.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over at the National Security Council </v>

4177
02:41:54.351 --> 02:41:55.700
<v Speaker 1>and eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4178
02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>they've got to spin on it.</v>

4179
02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about someone who died</v>

4180
02:42:00.191 --> 02:42:01.850
<v Speaker 2>before things were recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4181
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Making a movie on Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really know what he said.</v>

4182
02:42:05.201 --> 02:42:06.830
<v Speaker 2>You've got to kind of put words in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

4183
02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:08.650
<v Speaker 2>It's in a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he say to his wife?</v>

4184
02:42:08.651 --> 02:42:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Let's make up some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to his wife,</v>

4185
02:42:10.330 --> 02:42:11.163
<v Speaker 2>but Lincoln's Lincoln's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Schultz is alive and he's not that </v>

4186
02:42:14.531 --> 02:42:15.610
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he says,</v>

4187
02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I think he's probably 50 they talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him about it.</v>

4188
02:42:17.770 --> 02:42:18.603
<v Speaker 2>Did they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4189
02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:19.211
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4190
02:42:19.211 --> 02:42:20.044
<v Speaker 2>They talked to him about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking wasn't happy when the movie </v>

4191
02:42:21.971 --> 02:42:22.900
<v Speaker 2>was released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>

4192
02:42:22.901 --> 02:42:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4193
02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:25.990
<v Speaker 2>They made him look gang in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made it.</v>

4194
02:42:26.410 --> 02:42:29.110
<v Speaker 2>They alluded to some sort of a weird gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>affair with him.</v>

4195
02:42:29.111 --> 02:42:32.440
<v Speaker 2>And Dupont.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was frosted tips.</v>

4196
02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:33.670
<v Speaker 2>It was very odd.</v>

4197
02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Very odd what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed.</v>

4198
02:42:35.711 --> 02:42:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You know what frosted tips are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4199
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:41.010
<v Speaker 2>they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

4200
02:42:41.230 --> 02:42:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strip club,</v>

4201
02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:44.560
<v Speaker 2>no saying or his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4202
02:42:44.650 --> 02:42:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

4203
02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4204
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:50.260
<v Speaker 2>we all know who hasn't had frost 10 we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>

4205
02:42:51.610 --> 02:42:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4206
02:42:53.051 --> 02:42:54.790
<v Speaker 2>when I had hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about Camino.</v>

4207
02:42:54.850 --> 02:42:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I never had frosted tips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could have,</v>

4208
02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I could have been talked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've could have gotten to,</v>

4209
02:42:59.771 --> 02:43:00.604
<v Speaker 2>I've could have fallen into the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd of people in my twenties and I </v>

4210
02:43:02.771 --> 02:43:03.604
<v Speaker 2>could've wound up in rocking tipsy after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that game at fenway and found a </v>

4211
02:43:07.271 --> 02:43:09.400
<v Speaker 2>hairdresser upstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a hairdressers and said,</v>

4212
02:43:09.401 --> 02:43:10.600
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for me.</v>

4213
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Anybody saw the perfect guy</v>

4214
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:13.053
<v Speaker 3>with frosted tips and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would have been completely </v>

4215
02:43:14.651 --> 02:43:16.240
<v Speaker 3>different conversation that you and me </v>
<v Speaker 3>are having.</v>

4216
02:43:16.241 --> 02:43:18.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ice Man from top gun,</v>

4217
02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Val Kilmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kilmer kilmer,</v>

4218
02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:24.040
<v Speaker 3>he's not looking as good as he did back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the top gun days.</v>

4219
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.903
<v Speaker 3>He kind of slimmed down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got back to like a more manageable </v>

4220
02:43:27.941 --> 02:43:28.780
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4221
02:43:28.810 --> 02:43:31.360
<v Speaker 3>But for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he definitely shape.</v>

4222
02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:33.510
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went full trump for awhile.</v>

4223
02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:36.550
<v Speaker 3>He just ballooned up to this strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

4224
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:39.580
<v Speaker 3>that's odd because he was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful man.</v>

4225
02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:43.450
<v Speaker 3>That was alien movie and he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a tombstone.</v>

02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:47.140
<v Speaker 3>There's the frosted tips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad is nice man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4232
02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:04.030
<v Speaker 3>I saw him one time over at the Chateau </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marmont.</v>

4233
02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:04.893
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4234
02:44:04.930 --> 02:44:05.763
<v Speaker 3>working on my laptop and I look up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's across the room and I thought </v>

4235
02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:11.980
<v Speaker 3>something familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was during his,</v>

4236
02:44:11.981 --> 02:44:14.650
<v Speaker 3>a large stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember staring,</v>

4237
02:44:14.651 --> 02:44:16.420
<v Speaker 3>thinking there's something familiar </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that dude.</v>

4238
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:19.120
<v Speaker 3>And it took me forever to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I finally,</v>

4239
02:44:19.121 --> 02:44:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I was about to close my laptop at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aha.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Look at that one right at his belly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right.</v>

4250
02:44:47.170 --> 02:44:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh my Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop turning that roll down.</v>

4251
02:44:49.931 --> 02:44:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4252
02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.770
<v Speaker 3>actually look at his face there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in the,</v>

4253
02:44:52.771 --> 02:44:55.660
<v Speaker 3>not as fat with its face as he was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

4254
02:44:55.661 --> 02:45:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Remember when I was Batman?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He all by God Travolta.</v>

4255
02:45:00.011 --> 02:45:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a little bit,</v>

4256
02:45:01.690 --> 02:45:03.070
<v Speaker 3>what the Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

4257
02:45:03.270 --> 02:45:04.103
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll need to age better out in this </v>

4258
02:45:05.561 --> 02:45:06.880
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need to age better.</v>

4259
02:45:06.881 --> 02:45:09.130
<v Speaker 3>They need to learn to age gracefully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

4260
02:45:09.310 --> 02:45:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the doctor just tells you,</v>

4261
02:45:10.901 --> 02:45:12.430
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just give you a little,</v>

4262
02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:15.190
<v Speaker 3>a little nip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little talk and we'll be fine.</v>

4263
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Tell you what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A slippery slope.</v>

4264
02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Good looking man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but thank you.</v>

4266
02:45:24.371 --> 02:45:26.680
<v Speaker 3>eyes up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just it's gonna make your mouth.</v>

4267
02:45:26.681 --> 02:45:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one.</v>

4268
02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:30.820
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make your mouth a little bigger.</v>

4269
02:45:30.850 --> 02:45:31.683
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird one that women develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>this mouth that looks like they could </v>

4270
02:45:34.271 --> 02:45:35.240
<v Speaker 3>eat your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4271
02:45:35.350 --> 02:45:40.120
<v Speaker 3>There they're fucking choke her mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're pulling your face and in</v>

4272
02:45:40.121 --> 02:45:40.954
<v Speaker 3>pulling your face they stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do something crazy where they're </v>

4273
02:45:43.691 --> 02:45:46.180
<v Speaker 3>stretching your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tightened the,</v>

4274
02:45:46.181 --> 02:45:48.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tightened the Jina and they enlarge</v>

4275
02:45:48.381 --> 02:45:50.650
<v Speaker 3>the mouth and nothing wrong with Titan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and China.</v>

4276
02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:51.521
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I,</v>

4277
02:45:51.521 --> 02:45:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I just realized what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that medical responsible mass,</v>

4278
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:57.540
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight of a,</v>

4279
02:45:57.550 --> 02:45:58.660
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd want to tighten.</v>

4280
02:45:58.930 --> 02:45:59.763
<v Speaker 3>I know this is exactly what people would</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect to us to be talking about when I </v>

4281
02:46:02.111 --> 02:46:04.570
<v Speaker 3>come in on that afternoon on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

4282
02:46:04.571 --> 02:46:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this one guy,</v>

4283
02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:09.040
<v Speaker 3>this podcast will go south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4284
02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 3>we'll as</v>

4285
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:12.440
<v Speaker 1>well it has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might have.</v>

4286
02:46:12.470 --> 02:46:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to ask you one question before </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get out.</v>

4287
02:46:13.951 --> 02:46:14.784
<v Speaker 1>I can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're closing in on the three </v>

4288
02:46:15.591 --> 02:46:16.424
<v Speaker 1>hour mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interrogation school that you were </v>

4289
02:46:18.111 --> 02:46:18.944
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do they do to you when you're </v>

4290
02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:21.163
<v Speaker 1>in an interrogation school to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to understand what it's like to </v>

4291
02:46:23.751 --> 02:46:24.584
<v Speaker 1>break?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to talk about that to some </v>

4292
02:46:26.691 --> 02:46:27.380
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4293
02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:30.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean what you go through is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the waterboarding,</v>

4294
02:46:30.441 --> 02:46:31.221
<v Speaker 1>Nick's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

4295
02:46:31.221 --> 02:46:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean waterboarding has done to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

4296
02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:33.830
<v Speaker 1>to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our people.</v>

4297
02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So you've got waterboarded uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is anybody listening?</v>

4298
02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:37.493
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4299
02:46:37.970 --> 02:46:38.803
<v Speaker 1>Just keep telling me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep imagining because we'll probably </v>

4300
02:46:41.301 --> 02:46:43.180
<v Speaker 1>actually just recorded this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just being nice to me there.</v>

4301
02:46:43.181 --> 02:46:44.630
<v Speaker 1>It actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even recording it.</v>

4302
02:46:44.631 --> 02:46:46.940
<v Speaker 1>This is just happening and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in the dump lot.</v>

4303
02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

4304
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:49.543
<v Speaker 1>the point being is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that enhanced interrogation techniques </v>

4305
02:46:52.401 --> 02:46:55.550
<v Speaker 1>including sleep deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably at the end of the day,</v>

4306
02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:58.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation,</v>

4307
02:46:58.221 --> 02:47:00.170
<v Speaker 1>white noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress positions.</v>

4308
02:47:00.980 --> 02:47:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

4309
02:47:02.241 --> 02:47:05.870
<v Speaker 1>an interrogation facility is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4310
02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:08.210
<v Speaker 1>finally controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4311
02:47:08.810 --> 02:47:13.070
<v Speaker 1>very labor intensive place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like people think,</v>

4312
02:47:13.090 --> 02:47:14.630
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a apple grape.</v>

4313
02:47:14.631 --> 02:47:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abbott,</v>

4314
02:47:14.930 --> 02:47:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Greg wasn't an interrogation facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have them grade was a military holding</v>

4315
02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:21.660
<v Speaker 1>cell run by uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4316
02:47:21.730 --> 02:47:23.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that didn't have the experience,</v>

4317
02:47:23.841 --> 02:47:24.674
<v Speaker 1>they basically turned it over to junior </v>
<v Speaker 1>officers and people that shouldn't have </v>

4318
02:47:26.781 --> 02:47:30.710
<v Speaker 1>been in there running a facility like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and it was completely wrong.</v>

4319
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:34.700
<v Speaker 1>But an interrogation facility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in and it's,</v>

4320
02:47:34.701 --> 02:47:37.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about doing your homework.</v>

4321
02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:39.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever go in and sit down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

4322
02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:43.460
<v Speaker 1>a detainee unless you have done all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>

4323
02:47:43.461 --> 02:47:45.470
<v Speaker 1>You know where you want this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation to go.</v>

4324
02:47:45.470 --> 02:47:48.830
<v Speaker 1>You know the questions you want to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to appear to be wavering.</v>

4325
02:47:48.831 --> 02:47:53.150
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want to appear to be unsure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do your homework,</v>

4326
02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a polygraph.</v>

4327
02:47:54.890 --> 02:47:57.620
<v Speaker 1>If the polygraph operator doesn't do his</v>
<v Speaker 1>homework,</v>

4328
02:47:57.621 --> 02:47:58.454
<v Speaker 1>lie detector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he doesn't do his homework and that </v>

4329
02:47:59.931 --> 02:48:02.120
<v Speaker 1>exam is fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do polygraphs work?</v>

4330
02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4331
02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:05.270
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a science.</v>

4332
02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:08.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work in the sense that yes,</v>

4333
02:48:08.271 --> 02:48:09.104
<v Speaker 1>it will tell if you're lying or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tool in the kit bag of </v>

4334
02:48:12.021 --> 02:48:14.330
<v Speaker 1>understanding what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of person you're dealing with.</v>

4335
02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:17.810
<v Speaker 1>So for some people it works because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty about everything.</v>

4336
02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4337
02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:19.073
<v Speaker 1>And so they remember that in 1902 they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stole a pen and now they feel bad about </v>

4338
02:48:23.031 --> 02:48:23.510
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're gonna,</v>

4339
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the physical,</v>

4340
02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:27.920
<v Speaker 1>the physiology of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is starting to react.</v>

4341
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And that allows for the operator to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4342
02:48:30.231 --> 02:48:32.360
<v Speaker 1>there's something strange about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

4343
02:48:32.361 --> 02:48:34.820
<v Speaker 1>They reacted a little bit differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're breathing,</v>

4344
02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.140
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sweat,</v>

4345
02:48:36.170 --> 02:48:37.700
<v Speaker 1>they how to react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a reaction.</v>

4346
02:48:37.701 --> 02:48:38.534
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's now let's go in on that a little </v>

4347
02:48:39.261 --> 02:48:41.360
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess my point being is that,</v>

4348
02:48:41.361 --> 02:48:44.000
<v Speaker 1>or interrogations or even negotiations </v>
<v Speaker 1>or interviews,</v>

4349
02:48:44.001 --> 02:48:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're out there and your,</v>

4350
02:48:44.891 --> 02:48:46.550
<v Speaker 1>your job is to interview people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>

4351
02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like,</v>

4352
02:48:47.811 --> 02:48:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you gotta know who you're talking to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it becomes effective.</v>

4353
02:48:51.381 --> 02:48:53.150
<v Speaker 1>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in training,</v>

4354
02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:54.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go through all these things,</v>

4355
02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:56.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

4356
02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:57.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>

4357
02:48:57.620 --> 02:48:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it can be fairly intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea,</v>

4358
02:48:59.991 --> 02:49:01.610
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is to show will look,</v>

4359
02:49:01.611 --> 02:49:03.740
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it does.</v>

4360
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:05.930
<v Speaker 1>This is how you can deal with it.</v>

4361
02:49:06.290 --> 02:49:07.890
<v Speaker 1>This is how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4362
02:49:07.891 --> 02:49:11.210
<v Speaker 1>you stay close to some something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4363
02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:13.200
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's plausible.</v>

4364
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:13.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

4365
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:15.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alias or a,</v>

4366
02:49:15.591 --> 02:49:17.460
<v Speaker 1>a backstory or whatever you want to call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4367
02:49:17.850 --> 02:49:19.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to treat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to keep it close to the truth.</v>

4368
02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:20.813
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem that people have in </v>

4369
02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:24.150
<v Speaker 1>interrogation sometimes is they'll say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not true.</v>

4370
02:49:24.151 --> 02:49:24.984
<v Speaker 1>Now they got to remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they go back in for another </v>

4371
02:49:26.911 --> 02:49:27.744
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to remember what they said </v>

4372
02:49:28.081 --> 02:49:29.520
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if they say another line,</v>

4373
02:49:29.521 --> 02:49:30.354
<v Speaker 1>now they've got to remember those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and they was pretty soon after </v>

4374
02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:32.873
<v Speaker 1>three or four interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to remember this string </v>

4375
02:49:34.801 --> 02:49:35.634
<v Speaker 1>of lies where what you really want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you want to try to keep it as close </v>

4376
02:49:37.891 --> 02:49:42.891
<v Speaker 1>as possible to whatever the truth may be</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't have to spend all your</v>

4377
02:49:43.261 --> 02:49:46.290
<v Speaker 1>time struggling to remember what was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell I said last time.</v>

4378
02:49:46.350 --> 02:49:47.183
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lie to someone that you're </v>

4379
02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:50.250
<v Speaker 1>interrogating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's you're saying,</v>

4380
02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:52.550
<v Speaker 1>not if someone's being interrogated or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's,</v>

4381
02:49:52.850 --> 02:49:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an or,</v>

4382
02:49:54.331 --> 02:49:55.770
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the interview process.</v>

4383
02:49:55.771 --> 02:49:56.604
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

4384
02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:57.201
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4385
02:49:57.201 --> 02:49:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I'm going with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than to say that it's,</v>

4386
02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:00.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4387
02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:03.690
<v Speaker 1>and whether it's military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mild outfit or whomever,</v>

4388
02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:05.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an important,</v>

4389
02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:07.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of training because,</v>

4390
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:08.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4391
02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:09.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

4392
02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:11.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a changed world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4393
02:50:11.161 --> 02:50:11.994
<v Speaker 1>The Doj and the White House and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything came out and tortured people </v>

4394
02:50:14.511 --> 02:50:15.344
<v Speaker 1>in the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4395
02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't use enhance techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4396
02:50:17.431 --> 02:50:17.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4397
02:50:17.970 --> 02:50:18.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4398
02:50:19.050 --> 02:50:20.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4399
02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:22.520
<v Speaker 1>go and how people are screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexy.</v>

4400
02:50:22.610 --> 02:50:24.240
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking torture until I your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dope.</v>

4401
02:50:24.390 --> 02:50:25.830
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being is all you can use.</v>

4402
02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:28.320
<v Speaker 1>This is the field manual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military field manual.</v>

4403
02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4404
02:50:29.371 --> 02:50:30.204
<v Speaker 1>it means I couldn't break my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter with a military field </v>

4405
02:50:32.101 --> 02:50:32.911
<v Speaker 1>manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't,</v>

4406
02:50:32.911 --> 02:50:33.744
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the military field and what I </v>

4407
02:50:36.121 --> 02:50:37.320
<v Speaker 1>mean by that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to be,</v>

4408
02:50:37.380 --> 02:50:41.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to be flip or dismissive.</v>

4409
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:42.743
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once people out there know what can and </v>

4410
02:50:45.931 --> 02:50:48.540
<v Speaker 1>can't be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know how much they can take.</v>

4411
02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:49.403
<v Speaker 1>They know exactly what they can take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what exactly what's coming </v>

4412
02:50:51.121 --> 02:50:53.550
<v Speaker 1>down the pike and they're just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep their Yap shut.</v>

4413
02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:54.271
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4414
02:50:54.271 --> 02:50:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but you can develop a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

4415
02:50:56.810 --> 02:50:58.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4416
02:50:58.021 --> 02:50:58.854
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the information we got basically if </v>

4417
02:51:00.241 --> 02:51:02.670
<v Speaker 1>people took the time to go through Dlj </v>
<v Speaker 1>memos and look at the,</v>

4418
02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:03.713
<v Speaker 1>the actual information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of what we did was based on </v>

4419
02:51:06.390 --> 02:51:09.000
<v Speaker 1>conversing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on knowing who you're talking to,</v>

4420
02:51:09.150 --> 02:51:12.570
<v Speaker 1>doing your homework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how the pieces fit together</v>

4421
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:13.680
<v Speaker 1>and talking to people.</v>

4422
02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:14.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those people don't have much </v>

4423
02:51:16.441 --> 02:51:18.090
<v Speaker 1>incentive to talk sometimes if they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4424
02:51:18.091 --> 02:51:19.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do shit to him anyway.</v>

4425
02:51:19.650 --> 02:51:20.483
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll have to do is keep their </v>

4426
02:51:21.301 --> 02:51:24.320
<v Speaker 1>mouth shut and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saddled down by the rules.</v>

4427
02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:26.250
<v Speaker 1>The advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4428
02:51:26.251 --> 02:51:27.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced techniques.</v>

4429
02:51:27.571 --> 02:51:30.550
<v Speaker 1>You should do air quotes when you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's tech.</v>

4430
02:51:32.090 --> 02:51:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4431
02:51:33.541 --> 02:51:35.560
<v Speaker 1>and it has techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>

4432
02:51:35.570 --> 02:51:38.460
<v Speaker 1>as a perfect representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4433
02:51:38.461 --> 02:51:38.911
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

4434
02:51:38.911 --> 02:51:40.200
<v Speaker 1>and there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that was,</v>

4435
02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:42.780
<v Speaker 1>that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything else,</v>

4436
02:51:42.781 --> 02:51:43.614
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

4437
02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:44.753
<v Speaker 1>it's like all the other discussions </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been having in terms of people </v>

4438
02:51:47.551 --> 02:51:48.384
<v Speaker 1>based on their experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those people that you're never </v>

4439
02:51:49.921 --> 02:51:50.754
<v Speaker 1>going to shift off this position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to shift off of this </v>

4440
02:51:52.111 --> 02:51:55.260
<v Speaker 1>other position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all torture or it's not.</v>

4441
02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:56.093
<v Speaker 1>And there's some things that exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>between talking to a detainee and what </v>

4442
02:51:58.591 --> 02:52:01.020
<v Speaker 1>is torture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is noble when we don't</v>

4443
02:52:01.021 --> 02:52:02.350
<v Speaker 1>torture people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4444
02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4445
02:52:03.730 --> 02:52:04.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to,</v>

4446
02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:06.610
<v Speaker 1>that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

4447
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:08.680
<v Speaker 1>but I want them to not know what's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kit bag.</v>

4448
02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So enhanced techniques.</v>

4449
02:52:10.930 --> 02:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>So like when you say enhanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

4450
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:15.370
<v Speaker 1>is sleep deprivation and the enhanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques to sleep.</v>

4451
02:52:15.371 --> 02:52:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So you can't use that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4452
02:52:17.710 --> 02:52:19.240
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you read,</v>

4453
02:52:19.270 --> 02:52:20.410
<v Speaker 1>read what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what took place?</v>

4454
02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:21.453
<v Speaker 1>People read those deal memos and realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it wouldn't take it if they </v>

4455
02:52:23.771 --> 02:52:24.604
<v Speaker 1>actually took the time and understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the back and forth that took place </v>

4456
02:52:28.031 --> 02:52:31.210
<v Speaker 1>between the field and headquarters over </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

4457
02:52:31.211 --> 02:52:32.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we do this?</v>

4458
02:52:32.081 --> 02:52:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Can I put my hand on his chest and push </v>
<v Speaker 1>him up against a wall?</v>

4459
02:52:35.051 --> 02:52:35.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4460
02:52:35.801 --> 02:52:36.610
<v Speaker 1>build a fake wall.</v>

4461
02:52:36.610 --> 02:52:38.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you do this?</v>

4462
02:52:38.231 --> 02:52:38.651
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4463
02:52:38.651 --> 02:52:40.060
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I do?</v>

4464
02:52:40.061 --> 02:52:40.894
<v Speaker 1>And there was back and forth and back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth over what could be done and </v>

4465
02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:44.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4466
02:52:44.350 --> 02:52:47.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be nice and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not pleasant.</v>

4467
02:52:47.111 --> 02:52:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And we can argue and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously people do,</v>

4468
02:52:49.601 --> 02:52:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture is wrong and we shouldn't do it,</v>

4469
02:52:52.210 --> 02:52:53.043
<v Speaker 1>but do I think that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like a sleep deprivation or </v>

4470
02:52:54.911 --> 02:52:58.600
<v Speaker 1>stress positions or truck noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4471
02:52:58.620 --> 02:52:59.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4472
02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:01.090
<v Speaker 1>put your forward against the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk back,</v>

4473
02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:02.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

4474
02:53:02.250 --> 02:53:04.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean,</v>

4475
02:53:05.290 --> 02:53:08.240
<v Speaker 1>lean your head against the wall and walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and,</v>

4476
02:53:08.250 --> 02:53:10.030
<v Speaker 1>and stay in that position for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4477
02:53:10.330 --> 02:53:12.400
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make them do that.</v>

4478
02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if they don't in the old days?</v>

4479
02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4480
02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4481
02:53:16.570 --> 02:53:17.403
<v Speaker 1>people are pretty compliant in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogation facility back when they </v>

4482
02:53:19.211 --> 02:53:20.950
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what was coming down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pike.</v>

4483
02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:22.013
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I keep saying the same </v>

4484
02:53:22.901 --> 02:53:23.590
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4485
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree it shouldn't be torturing,</v>

4486
02:53:26.051 --> 02:53:26.884
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't also be telling the </v>

4487
02:53:28.211 --> 02:53:30.340
<v Speaker 1>hostiles what we can and can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4488
02:53:30.370 --> 02:53:31.203
<v Speaker 1>You say you shouldn't be torturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if you have someone who knows </v>

4489
02:53:34.091 --> 02:53:38.230
<v Speaker 1>that a nine 11 is about to take place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to get information out of</v>

4490
02:53:38.231 --> 02:53:40.120
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other ways are there?</v>

4491
02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:40.983
<v Speaker 1>If you have a small window of time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really the unsatisfactory </v>

4492
02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:45.221
<v Speaker 1>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not really,</v>

4493
02:53:45.221 --> 02:53:46.900
<v Speaker 1>torture doesn't really put through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

4494
02:53:46.901 --> 02:53:47.734
<v Speaker 1>I agree with Senator Mccain and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people about that people will say </v>

4495
02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:52.503
<v Speaker 1>whatever they need to say to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that horrible torture is to </v>

4496
02:53:54.881 --> 02:53:56.860
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not from an operational,</v>

4497
02:53:56.861 --> 02:53:57.161
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4498
02:53:57.161 --> 02:53:57.994
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that some moral aspect to </v>

4499
02:53:59.381 --> 02:54:00.214
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to just look at things from an </v>

4500
02:54:00.671 --> 02:54:02.320
<v Speaker 1>operational efficiency point of view.</v>

4501
02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

4502
02:54:04.260 --> 02:54:05.093
<v Speaker 1>you can't count on information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So beating somebody up doesn't get </v>

4503
02:54:06.971 --> 02:54:10.420
<v Speaker 1>information off their fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get information out of them,</v>

4504
02:54:10.570 --> 02:54:12.790
<v Speaker 1>but does sleep not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that are not,</v>

4505
02:54:12.791 --> 02:54:14.310
<v Speaker 1>that are hostile is out there and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

4506
02:54:14.311 --> 02:54:16.180
<v Speaker 1>The people that are after us wouldn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

4507
02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:17.073
<v Speaker 1>Of course they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really after accurate </v>

4508
02:54:19.211 --> 02:54:20.170
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

4509
02:54:20.171 --> 02:54:21.004
<v Speaker 1>It's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different world that they </v>

4510
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:22.503
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're after actionable intelligence </v>

4511
02:54:23.951 --> 02:54:26.260
<v Speaker 1>that you can count on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's just a very,</v>

4512
02:54:26.261 --> 02:54:28.420
<v Speaker 1>very labor intensive sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4513
02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:30.850
<v Speaker 1>there there's ways to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

4514
02:54:30.851 --> 02:54:32.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4515
02:54:32.561 --> 02:54:33.394
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this gets to a point </v>

4516
02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:35.680
<v Speaker 1>psychologically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

4517
02:54:35.681 --> 02:54:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's ways to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>comply,</v>

4518
02:54:37.751 --> 02:54:39.700
<v Speaker 1>get them and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the processes,</v>

4519
02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4520
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:42.820
<v Speaker 1>in a well controlled environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation or,</v>

4521
02:54:42.821 --> 02:54:44.290
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a white noise.</v>

4522
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:45.783
<v Speaker 1>How do you keep them awake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do for sleep </v>

4523
02:54:46.841 --> 02:54:47.970
<v Speaker 1>deprivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

4524
02:54:48.010 --> 02:54:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you keep him standing or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4525
02:54:49.811 --> 02:54:50.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep moving them from place to place or </v>

4526
02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:54.490
<v Speaker 1>you pump in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4527
02:54:54.670 --> 02:54:55.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic music or a baby crying or </v>

4528
02:54:56.981 --> 02:54:58.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4529
02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:00.880
<v Speaker 1>and it just keeps them awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4530
02:55:00.881 --> 02:55:01.301
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4531
02:55:01.301 --> 02:55:02.980
<v Speaker 1>it's labor intensive because you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep checking on them,</v>

4532
02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:03.823
<v Speaker 1>making sure they're awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do that in under a controlled </v>

4533
02:55:05.271 --> 02:55:05.911
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

4534
02:55:05.911 --> 02:55:06.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4535
02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:07.610
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4536
02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:09.040
<v Speaker 1>five days of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4537
02:55:09.410 --> 02:55:11.270
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people took the time to understand or</v>

4538
02:55:11.271 --> 02:55:12.104
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would realize that we're a lot of </v>

4539
02:55:13.430 --> 02:55:15.440
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists involved that were saying,</v>

4540
02:55:15.441 --> 02:55:15.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

4541
02:55:15.921 --> 02:55:17.770
<v Speaker 1>or you can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4542
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:19.760
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4543
02:55:20.750 --> 02:55:21.491
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4544
02:55:21.491 --> 02:55:21.861
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4545
02:55:21.861 --> 02:55:22.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get conflicted because I understand </v>

4546
02:55:23.991 --> 02:55:26.510
<v Speaker 1>why people are so emotive about it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that.</v>

4547
02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do agree there's,</v>

4548
02:55:28.970 --> 02:55:30.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4549
02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at what you can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do and you have to be very,</v>

4550
02:55:34.821 --> 02:55:37.130
<v Speaker 1>very critical about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be very careful.</v>

4551
02:55:37.131 --> 02:55:40.340
<v Speaker 1>But I guess I keep coming back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing as we've kind of given up the</v>

4552
02:55:40.341 --> 02:55:41.174
<v Speaker 1>ghost from now on going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody out there knows what we can </v>

4553
02:55:45.021 --> 02:55:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whether we were going to do it or</v>

4554
02:55:47.601 --> 02:55:48.434
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we wore in terms of the torture </v>

4555
02:55:49.461 --> 02:55:51.650
<v Speaker 1>side of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know that.</v>

4556
02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:52.633
<v Speaker 1>And so you could speed the process up of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to comply to some degree </v>

4557
02:55:56.181 --> 02:55:57.014
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't know what was coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the pike and you keep them on the </v>

4558
02:55:58.581 --> 02:56:02.440
<v Speaker 1>back foot and you keep them guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's your advantage in a,</v>

4559
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:04.700
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a situation like that.</v>

4560
02:56:04.701 --> 02:56:05.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4561
02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:07.580
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>

4562
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to the same thing.</v>

4563
02:56:08.990 --> 02:56:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people are so,</v>

4564
02:56:11.740 --> 02:56:12.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4565
02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:13.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be fair,</v>

4566
02:56:13.890 --> 02:56:16.760
<v Speaker 1>the left really did a great job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>framing the argument.</v>

4567
02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:18.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really took it and said,</v>

4568
02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.390
<v Speaker 1>you're either talking to somebody or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all torture.</v>

4569
02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:21.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if torture doesn't really produce </v>

4570
02:56:23.121 --> 02:56:23.954
<v Speaker 1>actionable information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it makes sense to not torture </v>

4571
02:56:25.581 --> 02:56:26.060
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4572
02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>

4573
02:56:28.250 --> 02:56:29.083
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I agree from ecstasy and hookers </v>

4574
02:56:31.430 --> 02:56:32.131
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4575
02:56:32.131 --> 02:56:32.964
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be a pleasant </v>

4576
02:56:34.761 --> 02:56:36.060
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people say,</v>

4577
02:56:36.061 --> 02:56:36.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you would,</v>

4578
02:56:36.921 --> 02:56:37.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4579
02:56:37.530 --> 02:56:39.110
<v Speaker 1>put somebody in a stress position or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

4580
02:56:39.250 --> 02:56:40.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them uncomfortable or you would </v>

4581
02:56:40.911 --> 02:56:43.870
<v Speaker 1>keep them awake for 36 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you would do.</v>

4582
02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

4583
02:56:45.020 --> 02:56:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you want to,</v>

4584
02:56:46.191 --> 02:56:47.210
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd always try,</v>

4585
02:56:47.211 --> 02:56:48.044
<v Speaker 1>you'd always try to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with people that is in </v>

4586
02:56:49.521 --> 02:56:50.900
<v Speaker 1>fact the best way to do it.</v>

4587
02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to Pry,</v>

4588
02:56:52.370 --> 02:56:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out about their psychology.</v>

4589
02:56:54.681 --> 02:56:55.514
<v Speaker 1>Try to find ways to get them on side to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get their sympathy or to bring them </v>

4590
02:57:00.081 --> 02:57:01.460
<v Speaker 1>on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you can do.</v>

4591
02:57:01.490 --> 02:57:04.400
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just say we're taking all these other</v>

4592
02:57:04.401 --> 02:57:07.130
<v Speaker 1>things out of the kit bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we ever gonna use them or not.</v>

4593
02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:08.353
<v Speaker 1>And here's all we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty much guaranteed that </v>

4594
02:57:11.271 --> 02:57:15.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people out there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are walking around on Syria and Iraq for</v>

4595
02:57:15.171 --> 02:57:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Isis carrying a field manual in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>back pocket who know exactly what we can</v>

4596
02:57:19.521 --> 02:57:20.360
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we can't do now,</v>

4597
02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:24.450
<v Speaker 3>but isn't there a ways we circumvent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that by not doing it on American soil?</v>

4598
02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:25.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4599
02:57:25.430 --> 02:57:26.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4600
02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:27.690
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people would like to think that.</v>

4601
02:57:27.691 --> 02:57:28.524
<v Speaker 3>I like to think that there's like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret CIA holding place that you take </v>

4602
02:57:31.171 --> 02:57:32.004
<v Speaker 3>people on the moon of question get stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>rockets up the ass and they start </v>

4603
02:57:34.381 --> 02:57:35.280
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm moon.</v>

4604
02:57:35.460 --> 02:57:38.490
<v Speaker 3>That would be you gotta be sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a lot of money.</v>

4605
02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Too much money on moon station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4606
02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one Tahmo for for instance,</v>

4607
02:57:43.531 --> 02:57:46.470
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of dark shit has gone on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Guantanamo,</v>

4608
02:57:46.471 --> 02:57:46.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4609
02:57:46.810 --> 02:57:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4610
02:57:48.431 --> 02:57:49.264
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4611
02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.580
<v Speaker 1>here's where people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

4612
02:57:51.581 --> 02:57:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4613
02:57:53.020 --> 02:57:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Watada Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4614
02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:57.230
<v Speaker 1>has always been more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4615
02:57:57.290 --> 02:57:59.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a holding facility.</v>

4616
02:57:59.470 --> 02:58:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And you could argue that though the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4617
02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:04.410
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you want to frame it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to say it was all torture,</v>

4618
02:58:04.411 --> 02:58:05.244
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the torture or the enhanced </v>

4619
02:58:06.151 --> 02:58:06.984
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

4620
02:58:06.990 --> 02:58:10.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part took place overseas in</v>

4621
02:58:10.670 --> 02:58:11.940
<v Speaker 1>a facilities that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4622
02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:15.450
<v Speaker 1>we were running that were temporary or </v>
<v Speaker 1>our host countries were running.</v>

4623
02:58:15.690 --> 02:58:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I would much rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

4624
02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:21.840
<v Speaker 1>we treat people a lot better than some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our allies do,</v>

4625
02:58:21.930 --> 02:58:22.763
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And particularly a lot of our Middle </v>

4626
02:58:24.450 --> 02:58:25.283
<v Speaker 1>Eastern allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could only imagine there are a lot of </v>

4627
02:58:26.911 --> 02:58:27.870
<v Speaker 1>guys in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

4628
02:58:27.871 --> 02:58:30.840
<v Speaker 1>in Guantanamo who would like to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo right now,</v>

4629
02:58:30.841 --> 02:58:32.270
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4630
02:58:32.310 --> 02:58:37.310
<v Speaker 1>then go be repatriated to the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>East and really?</v>

4631
02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

4632
02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:38.993
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than if that didn't go back and </v>

4633
02:58:40.201 --> 02:58:42.180
<v Speaker 1>face a Egyptian justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4634
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Jordanians are.</v>

4635
02:58:43.531 --> 02:58:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

4636
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:45.960
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>

4637
02:58:46.020 --> 02:58:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I know people are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4638
02:58:47.101 --> 02:58:49.320
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not clamoring to stay and get my</v>

4639
02:58:49.321 --> 02:58:50.154
<v Speaker 1>dog get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that they are treated better </v>

4640
02:58:52.530 --> 02:58:54.360
<v Speaker 1>in that facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they would be,</v>

4641
02:58:54.510 --> 02:58:56.940
<v Speaker 1>if they find themselves suddenly in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian prison,</v>

4642
02:58:56.970 --> 02:58:59.030
<v Speaker 1>if they were interrogated by our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4643
02:58:59.070 --> 02:58:59.903
<v Speaker 1>but having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there've been people that have been </v>

4644
02:59:00.811 --> 02:59:03.270
<v Speaker 1>found to have been detained there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really were innocent.</v>

4645
02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4646
02:59:06.780 --> 02:59:07.613
<v Speaker 1>did we throw out a big net and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>err on the side of caution when we were </v>

4647
02:59:12.181 --> 02:59:14.970
<v Speaker 1>picking people up off the battlefield?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4648
02:59:15.710 --> 02:59:16.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did we do a lot of good by removing a </v>

4649
02:59:21.121 --> 02:59:21.954
<v Speaker 1>lot of these people and some of the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>players off the battlefield and out of </v>

4650
02:59:24.211 --> 02:59:27.870
<v Speaker 1>the operational system within al Qaeda </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of their,</v>

4651
02:59:27.871 --> 02:59:28.980
<v Speaker 1>their supporting elements.</v>

4652
02:59:29.010 --> 02:59:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>

4653
02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:32.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not satisfying answer because it's </v>

4654
02:59:33.631 --> 02:59:35.550
<v Speaker 1>not black or white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not all bad.</v>

4655
02:59:35.580 --> 02:59:36.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

4656
02:59:36.931 --> 02:59:38.850
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gray,</v>

4657
02:59:38.910 --> 02:59:40.620
<v Speaker 1>it's the gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate,</v>

4658
02:59:40.621 --> 02:59:42.430
<v Speaker 1>but a part of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way that,</v>

4659
02:59:42.450 --> 02:59:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4660
02:59:43.140 --> 02:59:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes.</v>

4661
02:59:44.281 --> 02:59:45.570
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close it down and say,</v>

4662
02:59:45.571 --> 02:59:46.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sorry.</v>

4663
02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:48.990
<v Speaker 1>The recidivism rate for people coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a Gizmo is,</v>

4664
02:59:48.991 --> 02:59:51.800
<v Speaker 1>is up in the 30% outright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4665
02:59:51.801 --> 02:59:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a third plus.</v>

4666
02:59:53.730 --> 02:59:58.730
<v Speaker 1>And will you actually going to get my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would probably encourage them to want to</v>

4667
02:59:59.190 --> 03:00:00.750
<v Speaker 1>fucking hate America more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4668
03:00:00.751 --> 03:00:01.584
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4669
03:00:01.770 --> 03:00:02.603
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4670
03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:03.793
<v Speaker 1>don't probably that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably a fair </v>

4671
03:00:04.981 --> 03:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4672
03:00:06.570 --> 03:00:07.403
<v Speaker 1>do I want them back out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield looking to kill us or our </v>

4673
03:00:09.211 --> 03:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>allies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4674
03:00:10.530 --> 03:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4675
03:00:11.010 --> 03:00:11.843
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4676
03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:14.440
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4677
03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the area we've got to close Gitmo</v>

4678
03:00:16.770 --> 03:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4679
03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>the 46 or so that we're never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>repatriate over to us soil.</v>

4680
03:00:22.350 --> 03:00:22.971
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4681
03:00:22.971 --> 03:00:23.804
<v Speaker 1>as a president gets his way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's going to get passed </v>

4682
03:00:24.780 --> 03:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

4683
03:00:26.610 --> 03:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things down,</v>

4684
03:00:28.071 --> 03:00:28.904
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to close it down and this is </v>

4685
03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>probably want to do with this 46 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are being told is 91 there.</v>

4686
03:00:33.301 --> 03:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>But by the time you get to the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just aren't going to find at home,</v>

4687
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4688
03:00:38.410 --> 03:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>the Bishop Bush administration and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama Administration,</v>

4689
03:00:40.591 --> 03:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>we've spent years and years trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find places for these people.</v>

4690
03:00:42.901 --> 03:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not like anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4691
03:00:44.130 --> 03:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to try to get these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>sent somewhere else.</v>

4692
03:00:47.010 --> 03:00:47.843
<v Speaker 1>That's been a goal of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this administration and the previous </v>

4693
03:00:49.441 --> 03:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>one and it just some folks who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to find another home.</v>

4694
03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's about 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>46 of them.</v>

4695
03:00:55.710 --> 03:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them back to the states,</v>

4696
03:00:58.321 --> 03:00:59.154
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

4697
03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:01.353
<v Speaker 2>how do they catch these people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's all various different </v>

4698
03:01:03.791 --> 03:01:04.370
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4699
03:01:04.370 --> 03:01:04.580
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4700
03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4701
03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:05.931
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

4702
03:01:05.931 --> 03:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I was old days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

4703
03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear us talking about catching</v>

4704
03:01:08.811 --> 03:01:09.644
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason why it's because </v>

4705
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.823
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather just paint that target and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and blow the fuck out of him then risk </v>

4706
03:01:16.521 --> 03:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4707
03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>picking up somebody and then getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of,</v>

4708
03:01:20.641 --> 03:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4709
03:01:21.591 --> 03:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>mishandling a detainee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4710
03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:25.093
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or all the crap that can happen because </v>

4711
03:01:26.511 --> 03:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>suddenly they've decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4712
03:01:28.251 --> 03:01:29.084
<v Speaker 1>a program for capturing somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing them back to go autonomo </v>

4713
03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:35.870
<v Speaker 1>wherever is not appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you've found over the years,</v>

4714
03:01:35.871 --> 03:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>recent past is it's a lot easier to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke them then to pick them up.</v>

4715
03:01:41.060 --> 03:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>

4716
03:01:42.051 --> 03:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sad thing to say.</v>

4717
03:01:43.581 --> 03:01:44.414
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what does that mean from an </v>

4718
03:01:45.441 --> 03:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>operationally efficient point of view?</v>

4719
03:01:47.390 --> 03:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That means your pipeline of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is drying up because you're</v>

4720
03:01:51.141 --> 03:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not picking these people up live.</v>

4721
03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just easier to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

4722
03:01:54.730 --> 03:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>to whack them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a harsh reality.</v>

4723
03:01:57.500 --> 03:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4724
03:01:57.930 --> 03:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the way it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way it works.</v>

4725
03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:01.753
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was getting their ass kicked </v>

4726
03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>for being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4727
03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4728
03:02:05.750 --> 03:02:07.160
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4729
03:02:07.161 --> 03:02:07.994
<v Speaker 1>approved program of whether it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>rendition or the interrogation program </v>

4730
03:02:11.481 --> 03:02:11.901
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4731
03:02:11.901 --> 03:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever as part of that or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery.</v>

4732
03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4733
03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>people look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drone program and think,</v>

4734
03:02:18.051 --> 03:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really expanded under Obama.</v>

4735
03:02:19.791 --> 03:02:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shit,</v>

4736
03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4737
03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>just take 'em out</v>

4738
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.823
<v Speaker 2>the heartburn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why the drone program has </v>

4739
03:02:26.811 --> 03:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>expanded because capturing detainees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

4740
03:02:31.070 --> 03:02:33.500
<v Speaker 2>administration wants more people to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Guantanamo.</v>

4741
03:02:33.620 --> 03:02:34.453
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's easier to kill someone </v>

4742
03:02:36.141 --> 03:02:38.840
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to have civilian casualties and the</v>

4743
03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:41.240
<v Speaker 2>civilian casualties are pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>high with drones,</v>

4744
03:02:41.241 --> 03:02:42.074
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4745
03:02:42.150 --> 03:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4746
03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:43.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

4747
03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>again under the theory that nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be perfect.</v>

4748
03:02:46.051 --> 03:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They try everything they can to limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4749
03:02:48.570 --> 03:02:49.403
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there've been civilian </v>

4750
03:02:50.101 --> 03:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>

4751
03:02:51.331 --> 03:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>But then it's something crazy like 80%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4752
03:02:53.790 --> 03:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that high.</v>

4753
03:02:54.691 --> 03:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4754
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>you could argue even once too high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4755
03:02:58.081 --> 03:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

4756
03:02:59.690 --> 03:03:00.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4757
03:03:00.631 --> 03:03:01.470
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

4758
03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Numbers get thrown out on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a,</v>

4759
03:03:05.030 --> 03:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4760
03:03:06.450 --> 03:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had,</v>

4761
03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:09.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had unfortunate instance,</v>

4762
03:03:09.361 --> 03:03:11.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

4763
03:03:11.251 --> 03:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>one is too many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

4764
03:03:13.141 --> 03:03:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess my point being is the drone </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs expanded,</v>

4765
03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:17.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part because it's perceived as a </v>

4766
03:03:22.830 --> 03:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds awful.</v>

4767
03:03:25.630 --> 03:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And it is awful because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an operational perspective,</v>

4768
03:03:28.441 --> 03:03:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have my hands on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>detainee to know what they know.</v>

4769
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:33.870
<v Speaker 1>And once you smoke them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to know that shit.</v>

4770
03:03:33.930 --> 03:03:34.680
<v Speaker 1>So what</v>

4771
03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:37.680
<v Speaker 2>if they come up with a way one day to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

4772
03:03:37.681 --> 03:03:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that they have something called f</v>

4773
03:03:39.980 --> 03:03:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Mri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional magnetic resonance imagery,</v>

4774
03:03:43.561 --> 03:03:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they've used it.</v>

4775
03:03:46.170 --> 03:03:47.003
<v Speaker 2>I believe in India it was a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic case because they convicted </v>

4776
03:03:51.661 --> 03:03:52.494
<v Speaker 2>someone for murder because they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional knowledge of the crime and </v>

4777
03:03:56.341 --> 03:03:59.690
<v Speaker 2>people who I talked to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientist who was,</v>

4778
03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:03.950
<v Speaker 2>she was kind of an expert in Fmr I and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she said that's a huge,</v>

4779
03:04:03.980 --> 03:04:04.813
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge problem with them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would never fly in the United States </v>

4780
03:04:06.471 --> 03:04:07.304
<v Speaker 2>because functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional knowledge of the crime could </v>

4781
03:04:10.881 --> 03:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>have been established through her </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrogation process,</v>

4782
03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:18.170
<v Speaker 2>through questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through asking her about the case.</v>

4783
03:04:18.290 --> 03:04:20.450
<v Speaker 2>She could have functional knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crime scene.</v>

4784
03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:23.960
<v Speaker 2>So like proving it through an Fmri she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4785
03:04:23.970 --> 03:04:25.460
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

4786
03:04:25.461 --> 03:04:26.294
<v Speaker 2>So what they're convicting someone on is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that would never fly in </v>

4787
03:04:28.851 --> 03:04:30.650
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if they could,</v>

4788
03:04:30.680 --> 03:04:33.020
<v Speaker 2>if they could one day figure out a way</v>

4789
03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:35.323
<v Speaker 1>that one's like minority report or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that movie was with Val kilmer </v>

4790
03:04:37.970 --> 03:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>before he gained weight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4791
03:04:39.350 --> 03:04:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I was Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Guy.</v>

4792
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4793
03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:44.810
<v Speaker 1>They think it's the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never seen him photograph together.</v>

4794
03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't even notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Yasser Arafat and Ringo Starr.</v>

4795
03:04:47.450 --> 03:04:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I think you were in a movie together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4796
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>They weren't top gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they weren't.</v>

4797
03:04:51.130 --> 03:04:53.270
<v Speaker 1>But what am I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

4798
03:04:53.271 --> 03:04:53.681
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4799
03:04:53.681 --> 03:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I had my memory wiped clean by seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deicing fat val kilmer.</v>

4800
03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4801
03:05:01.700 --> 03:05:03.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I got to tell you this has</v>

4802
03:05:03.441 --> 03:05:07.670
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the viewers are tired of it,</v>

4803
03:05:07.671 --> 03:05:08.510
<v Speaker 1>but I've had a great time.</v>

4804
03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:09.753
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John to thank you very much for doing </v>

4805
03:05:10.510 --> 03:05:11.950
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate your,</v>

4806
03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>your candor and your openness and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4807
03:05:14.501 --> 03:05:17.710
<v Speaker 2>exploring some uncomfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult subjects and uh,</v>

4808
03:05:17.711 --> 03:05:18.544
<v Speaker 2>and given us some inside information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's very difficult for people to </v>

4809
03:05:21.431 --> 03:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>get any other way unless they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a guy like you.</v>

4810
03:05:24.341 --> 03:05:25.174
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of it is speculation and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bullshit and posturing and reading </v>

4811
03:05:29.351 --> 03:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>websites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be completely inaccurate.</v>

4812
03:05:31.481 --> 03:05:32.890
<v Speaker 2>So I think you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

4813
03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:33.790
<v Speaker 2>you've helped us a lot.</v>

4814
03:05:33.820 --> 03:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate,</v>

4815
03:05:34.900 --> 03:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I just encourage everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just read everything you can.</v>

4816
03:05:37.331 --> 03:05:38.164
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't settle on one source of </v>

4817
03:05:38.681 --> 03:05:39.461
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4818
03:05:39.461 --> 03:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right and the left.</v>

4819
03:05:40.691 --> 03:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Make that mistake again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4820
03:05:42.881 --> 03:05:43.220
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

4821
03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:44.053
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting to a point where it's </v>

4822
03:05:44.411 --> 03:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4823
03:05:45.431 --> 03:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>We've got to find a way to get back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the center and get shit done.</v>

4824
03:05:50.440 --> 03:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
