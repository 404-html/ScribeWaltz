00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I was okay.</v>

114
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't crazy.</v>

115
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Then I smoked my first refer when I was 15.</v>

116
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I banked it from my dad and uh,</v>

117
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea how strong it was and we rolled a joint and me and my friend Josh</v>

118
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>and this girl that I was dating,</v>

119
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>we smoke this shit and we smoked way too much for 15 year olds,</v>

120
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:46.174
<v Speaker 1>whatever we were.</v>

121
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And we wound up waking up in various parts of the house,</v>

122
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>like blank,</v>

123
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.673
<v Speaker 1>like blink.</v>

124
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's never happened to me before,</v>

125
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.051
<v Speaker 1>but like blank.</v>

126
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I'd be on the couch,</v>

127
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>blink.</v>

128
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I'd be in front of the frigerator like blink all the time in</v>

129
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>between the blanks missing.</v>

130
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

131
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Just arriving places like waking up in a bedroom with short term memory,</v>

132
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>not just no short term memory.</v>

133
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like my tape gets cut like the,</v>

134
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.321
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

135
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the events between those two did not exist.</v>

136
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.011
<v Speaker 1>I get so high,</v>

137
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I had zero memory so I would,</v>

138
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.743
<v Speaker 1>what I would think it was,</v>

139
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.001
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

140
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I got so high that I would say,</v>

141
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.071
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

142
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I need to just get into the kitchen and maybe get something to eat and maybe</v>

143
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:32.371
<v Speaker 1>it'll calm this down so my brain's spools up that it's got to figure out to</v>

144
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>remember to get to the kitchen to eat.</v>

145
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm that high.</v>

146
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>And then in between,</v>

147
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:37.601
<v Speaker 1>during the walking,</v>

148
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I forget everything.</v>

149
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.641
<v Speaker 1>So then boom,</v>

150
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I wake up and I'm in front of the fridge or I go,</v>

153
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>My friend Josh was doing it too.</v>

154
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.890

157
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Scared me off of weed for a long time.</v>

158
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't smoke weed again for several years after that.</v>

159
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>The first time the hydro brother don't get that design.</v>

162
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You ended up at a bowling alley by the chocolate milk.</v>

163
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why I went and ate.</v>

<v Speaker 1>third?</v>

184
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Like we get together and rolled a joint.</v>

185
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:40.661
<v Speaker 1>In those days.</v>

186
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.980

189
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.760
