00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

<v Speaker 1>giant match.</v>

4
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Eddie beats could start with Dante says,</v>

6
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>who was a very high level Jujitsu black belt and a,</v>

7
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.421
<v Speaker 1>he taps him,</v>

8
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.254
<v Speaker 1>he gets his back.</v>

9
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>So I saw that you're pumped up,</v>

10
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11

<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

12
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you felt very confident,</v>

13
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you felt good and you were,</v>

14
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you were zoned in,</v>

16
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you were going to fight heuler Gracie seemed so crazy to me.</v>

17
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.741
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

18
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>this deep knowing what I know about the,</v>

19
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>he's knowing what I know about the history of the family,</v>

20
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>knowing what a legendary family there to see you.</v>

21
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>My best friend standing there with Hoya,</v>

22
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Gracie and you guys are about to grapple.</v>

23
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

24
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>and we're in Brazil like to this fucking trip.</v>

25
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I was starstruck.</v>

26
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I was like on some watching some three d TV or something.</v>

27
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you're right there on the mat.</v>

28
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.913
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Eddie wound up catching him in a triangle.</v>

30
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It was the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.</v>

31
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.151
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>it was like time stopped and he's like,</v>

34
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>when you slapped that triangle on them,</v>

35
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like time stopped.</v>

36
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even seem real and you kept,</v>

37
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>you kept jailbreaking man,</v>

38
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>which is why it was hilarious.</v>

39
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>That dexterity that you have with your legs and you're setting up this alma plot</v>

40
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:15.264
<v Speaker 1>to here</v>

41
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.463
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

42
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you got him in like full full rubber guard here.</v>

43
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>That mission control is at the beginning of the rubber guard,</v>

45
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:23.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

48
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>what you had then was the ability to control people.</v>

49
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 1>You just didn't have as many variations on technique to attack with,</v>

50
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>but you had this unbelievable fucking flexibility that a lot of people aren't</v>

51
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:33.904
<v Speaker 1>aware of.</v>

52
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You got some weird flexibility and not just flexibility but dexterity like in</v>

53
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>places that maybe some people can grab their leg and put it,</v>

54
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you could put your leg there on its own,</v>

55
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many guys that are out there that w it's not that weird of</v>

56
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:51.251
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>

57
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:56.251
<v Speaker 1>It's just getting into load is like if you got into yoga and you've got obsessed</v>

58
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

59
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>eventually two years,</v>

60
00:01:59.261 --> 00:01:59.741
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

61
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:00.221
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>

62
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be able to get into the very basic lotus position.</v>

63
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

64
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a little more than that fell.</v>

65
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:06.244
<v Speaker 1>Are you being nice?</v>

66
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it's what it is.</v>

68
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.471
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying,</v>

69
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is you got some crazy legs,</v>

70
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>something weird about your legs.</v>

71
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Your legs are like arms.</v>

72
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.130
<v Speaker 1>They move in strange ways,</v>

73
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Hairs.</v>

75
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't try to pass right there and if we had just stayed in my guard,</v>

76
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have gotten them this one and a half and this transition.</v>

77
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.943
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

78
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

79
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>He got aggressive and he shouldn't have got aggressive.</v>

80
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

81
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.690
<v Speaker 1>if he would've just been conservative,</v>

82
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have been able to go right here.</v>

83
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Right into the triangle,</v>

84
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>boom over hook.</v>

85
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

86
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:40.911
<v Speaker 1>John Jack right there.</v>

87
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>That's all Jay.</v>

88
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>You control that wrist and slapped it over.</v>

89
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>And now this right here where you had the triangle locked in once here,</v>

90
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.831
<v Speaker 1>like right there,</v>

91
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:49.161
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

92
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

93
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Because before it was like one of those things where you're not breathing</v>

94
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>because it's not totally locked in,</v>

95
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but once you had it locked behind the knee,</v>

96
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at,</v>

97
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

98
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>how is this guy going to survive and he's tapping.</v>

99
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.911
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

100
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>he can't survive like no one can.</v>

101
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a human being.</v>

102
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>When you have a guy your size and you slap a triangle on this tight.</v>

103
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.191
<v Speaker 1>See right here.</v>

104
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure Pam there.</v>

105
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I knew like when once he dropped down I was like,</v>

106
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>holy shit that's locked in.</v>

107
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.450
<v Speaker 1>You were screaming,</v>

108
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.741
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

109
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>And we were the only one screaming because everybody else was freaking out.</v>

110
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>This Brazilian TV station,</v>

111
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>it's set up cameras there.</v>

112
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>They shut down the other matches so they could better light this match because</v>

113
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.521
<v Speaker 1>Hoya Gray,</v>

114
00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>she's a hero and they,</v>

115
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>they were going to show boiler Gracie dominating the first time Abu Dhabi came</v>

116
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>to Sao Paulo.</v>

117
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>When you slap this triangle on them,</v>

118
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

119
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>all you heard was me and Jamie Walsh.</v>

120
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Me and Jamie Walsh are yelling out,</v>

121
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:46.991
<v Speaker 1>pull the head,</v>

122
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>pull the head.</v>

123
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

124
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.051
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

125
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>It was just madness.</v>

126
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

127
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.141
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

128
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

129
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't even believe it.</v>

130
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And then once you did pull the head and once he did tap,</v>

131
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>it was like the world froze.</v>

132
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

133
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.023
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>

134
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.003
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make sense.</v>

135
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>The world just became some new place.</v>

136
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>The world is a totally new element opened up.</v>

137
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Like the world became a new place.</v>

138
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden Eddie Bravo is a champion martial artist.</v>

139
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Well I didn't win the championship.</v>

140
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

141
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You just tap toilet Gracie like you're,</v>

142
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>you're capable of tapping oil and grease.</v>

143
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That's championship level shit.</v>

144
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>He tapped one of the greatest guys of all time.</v>

145
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

146
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>it was a whole new world opened up.</v>

147

151
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.250

152
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:36.461

<v Speaker 1>a lot of really,</v>

181
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.300
<v Speaker 1>really high level fighters.</v>

182
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Fought a lot of really good a Jujitsu fighters fought and the main event was</v>

183
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Eddie versus Hoya,</v>

184
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Gracie and,</v>

185
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>11 years running.</v>

187
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

188
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a long time in between matches and there was so much talk,</v>

189
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.720
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>

190
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>so many haters,</v>

191
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>so many believers,</v>

192
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:37.051
<v Speaker 1>so many.</v>

193
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:37.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

194
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>there's so much back and forth between,</v>

195
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:44.640
<v Speaker 1>the people that thought that Eddie winning the first time was a fluke and the</v>

197
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:49.641
<v Speaker 1>people that legitimately thought that Eddie has a brilliant mind and a creative</v>

198
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.060
<v Speaker 1>mind for Jujitsu,</v>

199
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>that's really unique.</v>

200
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>And he can come up with a lot of techniques and his deck,</v>

201
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:55.861
<v Speaker 1>like he's talking,</v>

202
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to admit he's got weird dexterity in his legs,</v>

203
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>but he can move his legs in weird ways.</v>

204
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.300
<v Speaker 1>He can wrap you up and triangles and stuff and,</v>

205
00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and weird ways without a lot of people have to grab their foot and place in</v>

206
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

207
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

208
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>so he has these techniques that he's developed and like really created a bunch</v>

209
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>of paths like been,</v>

210
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of Jujitsu guys do this,</v>

211
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>this is not unique.</v>

212
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but his past where uniquely his and that he came up with a lot of different</v>

214
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>techniques and approaches and refined a lot of other approaches that,</v>

215
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>so he sort of adopted or adapted to Jujitsu.</v>

216
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

217
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>the system in 2003 was really,</v>

218
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even a 10th of what it is now.</v>

219
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

220
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 1>after 2003,</v>

221
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Eddie started teaching and then it became crazy.</v>

222
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:49.721
<v Speaker 1>Then the system started growing and new techniques were added and that there</v>

223
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.710
<v Speaker 1>became guys like to any provost who's a,</v>

224
00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:57.711
<v Speaker 1>a a world champion as a brown belt guys came out of there that we're showing</v>

225
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.151
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>

226
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>your techniques weren't just for you and your crazy dexterity but you had broken</v>

227
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>down things in a way that you know,</v>

228
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

229
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>other people hadn't done before and a weird way your,</v>

230
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

231
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>your positions,</v>

232
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>your very unique.</v>

233
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

234
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of people that do want to accept that for whatever reason.</v>

235
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>And there was all this,</v>

236
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.721
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

237
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:18.351
<v Speaker 1>he got lucky,</v>

238
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.011
<v Speaker 1>all fluke,</v>

239
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.844
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>

240
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 1>So Saturday night rolls around and I couldn't imagine there being more</v>

241
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>anticipation in a room before something.</v>

242
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>And it was a cool anticipation too because one of the things I like about</v>

243
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is no one's going to get knocked the fuck out.</v>

244
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Even if you get choked out,</v>

245
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>there's something about like seeing a friend fight.</v>

247
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>It gets real rough.</v>

248
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've been friends with MMA fighters,</v>

249
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but I've never been as friendly with an MMA fighters.</v>

250
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:43.511
<v Speaker 1>I am with you,</v>

251
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:44.344
<v Speaker 1>you know I've,</v>

252
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.501
<v Speaker 1>but no one,</v>

253
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>a guy and liking a guy and then watched him get head kicked.</v>

254
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.913
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do,</v>

255
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>so it didn't have the date that,</v>

257
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 1>that aspect to it,</v>

258
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 1>but it was all positive is what I'm trying to say.</v>

259
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It was all just holy shit,</v>

260
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.364
<v Speaker 1>it's going down.</v>

261
00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

262
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and once it did,</v>

263
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>there was no points because it's a 20 minute match.</v>

264
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>So for 20 minutes it's either submission or no points,</v>

265
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but in that 20 minutes you swept him on multiple occasions.</v>

266
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>You've got side control.</v>

267
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>He never threatened you in any way,</v>

268
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

269
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>You swept in with electric chairs.</v>

270
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>You threatened him with a neck crank and you threatened him with this nasty</v>

271
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking submission move on his knee.</v>

272
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Which I don't,</v>

273
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he didn't tap cause that was hard to watch,</v>

275
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:30.351
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

276
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>when we were sitting there watching.</v>

277
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.391
<v Speaker 1>That was the move.</v>

278
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I got you on the high time.</v>

279
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.213
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

280
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>That movie's so painful.</v>

281
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Just that photo shoot,</v>

282
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.190

283
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:40.550

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.670

289
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

290
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to tap.</v>

291
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>He just decided he wasn't going to tap.</v>

292
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

293
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>for people who,</v>

294
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

295
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 1>have never seen Jujitsu before,</v>

296
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

297
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that was like the perfect introduction match because it was so exciting.</v>

298
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>There was so much madness and there was a bunch of times where you were,</v>

299
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 1>you were working on shit and he rolled you over onto your back and then he swept</v>

301
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:11.070
<v Speaker 1>him again.</v>

302
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>So there's all these like seesaws when he would roll,</v>

303
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:14.341
<v Speaker 1>you'd be on your back.</v>

304
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:14.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

305
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>she has back.</v>

306
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>But you on your back is different than a lot of people on your back because</v>

307
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>that's how he tapped him in the first fight.</v>

308
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>You tapped him from your back.</v>

309
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.284
<v Speaker 1>Your back is,</v>

310
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:22.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:22.881
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

312
00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>your card is crafty.</v>

313
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.303
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

314
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>it was an incredibly thrilling match because there was constant threat at all</v>

315
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:31.134
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

316
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And even from him,</v>

317
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.091
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

318
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>he's still oily.</v>

319
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Gracie,</v>

320
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you always knew.</v>

321
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

322
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 1>he's still that champion.</v>

323
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 1>If something went wrong,</v>

324
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't dot your i's and cross your t's,</v>

325
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Ellis,</v>

326
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 2>not sure I was going to win this fight.</v>

327
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.010
<v Speaker 2>How could you be sure he's fucking crazy.</v>

328
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

329
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 2>he's soiler fucking Gracie.</v>

330
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I never said that.</v>

331
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out there and just strangle them.</v>

332
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.353
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>

333
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

334
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't competed in so long.</v>

335
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:53.911
<v Speaker 2>Look right here,</v>

336
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm faking like I'm going to wrestle</v>

337
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't think he was just going to let me pull them into quarter guard.</v>

338
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I thought at this point my wow.</v>

339
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 2>He just thought he was just going to try some totally different ship,</v>

340
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 2>but this is what he always does.</v>

341
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Every morning before I work out,</v>

342
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 2>I warm up on the stair master.</v>

343
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I go to youtube,</v>

344
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>but Heuler ADCC pick one of his matches and that's how I get,</v>

345
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 2>that gives me all the motivation.</v>

346
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I just watch him roll and he's so good at this,</v>

347
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 2>but I thought he would try to pass to the other side and I thought this</v>

348
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.424
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

349
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought this position was going to be the hardest to get and this was the key.</v>

350
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 2>If I could just get quarter guard in this position,</v>

351
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I could get them</v>

352
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and was a bunch of crazy rules.</v>

353
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 1>In this match as well.</v>

354
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the rules was that boiler was wearing like these skin tight shorts.</v>

355
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Eddie was wearing Gucci Pants.</v>

356
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

357
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and Heuler was allowed to grab Eddie's ski pants but Eddie wasn't allowed to</v>

358
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>grab toilet shorts.</v>

359
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So it was weird to watch man.</v>

360
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's times where he's like giving you a Wedgie and pulling on your</v>

361
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

362
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:54.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

363
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:56.200
<v Speaker 2>He's pulling them down and could see my underwear.</v>

364
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

365
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.450
<v Speaker 2>And when</v>

366
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>and when he got to that a leg lock and he's trying to defend that leg lock and</v>

367
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you're tearing his knee apart and he's hanging onto your,</v>

368
00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:05.150
<v Speaker 1>your cough.</v>

369
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 2>It's saved him.</v>

370
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.740
<v Speaker 2>The pat saved him.</v>

371
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

372
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause he didn't have the pants.</v>

373
00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I would have stomped on that foot and got the extra power because he,</v>

374
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:11.930
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

375
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean a man,</v>

376
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.510
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

377
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I think his knee popped at least seven times.</v>

378
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.983
<v Speaker 2>We were talking.</v>

379
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

380
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.520
<v Speaker 2>we could stop this now.</v>

381
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 2>You sure?</v>

382
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.331
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

383
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:20.511
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

384
00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

385
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.861
<v Speaker 2>And I'm popping.</v>

386
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:22.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

387
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:22.934
<v Speaker 2>what about that?</v>

388
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.983
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm fine.</v>

389
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

390
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 2>it just kept popping on my damn.</v>

391
00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Well you sure cause everything's good.</v>

392
00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:27.771
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

393
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:28.604
<v Speaker 2>everything's fine.</v>

394
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Like we're talking throughout this whole match,</v>

395
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:31.641
<v Speaker 2>like right here.</v>

396
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:32.810
<v Speaker 2>He wanted the under up really,</v>

397
00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>

398
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.600
<v Speaker 2>So I was saying it's hard to get this time.</v>

399
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

400
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause the first time he got the under under,</v>

401
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lot of work cause that's a hard one.</v>

402
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:47.110
<v Speaker 2>It's only because I would rather go against a guy who wasn't really mad at me.</v>

403
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 2>If I could joke with you and get like a,</v>

404
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:51.140
<v Speaker 2>like this is just for fun.</v>

405
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

406
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

407
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Then I feel like,</v>

408
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.383
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

409
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I can get this guy now because I could win because he's not mad.</v>

410
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.913
<v Speaker 2>He's mad.</v>

411
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

412
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I would never want to find like a Diego Sanchez type guy was mad at me.</v>

413
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:01.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

414
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.081
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

415
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:02.231
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

416
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

417
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to find a guy that's like friendly and shit.</v>

418
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.113
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

419
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.630
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

420
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I was just constantly joking with them constantly.</v>

421
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

422
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.290
<v Speaker 2>during like after I swept and when I get on top and the electric turn them,</v>

423
00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:16.491
<v Speaker 2>hold him,</v>

424
00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:16.661
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

425
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:17.411
<v Speaker 2>you can't move from here.</v>

426
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So just hang on and relax.</v>

427
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I need about a minute to rust and I go,</v>

428
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 2>you can't do nothing.</v>

429
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.344
<v Speaker 2>Just relax.</v>

430
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Because there are some positions where there,</v>

431
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.071
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

432
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe three or four positions are like cradles there,</v>

433
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 2>like rustling cradles.</v>

434
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 2>And it happens here where the guy on the bottom just can't do anything.</v>

435
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>He's not getting tapped but he can't move.</v>

436
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 2>He's to completely wrapped up and I used those spots to rest.</v>

437
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.401
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

438
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

439
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's hilarious that you told,</v>

440
00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:44.681
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

441
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 2>just relax.</v>

442
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.071
<v Speaker 2>When me and John,</v>

443
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Jack Russel,</v>

444
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.240
<v Speaker 2>we are always talking smack to each other.</v>

445
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.231
<v Speaker 2>Me and John.</v>

446
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 2>John always goof and we're,</v>

447
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:55.511
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

448
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 2>it's always a joke.</v>

449
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.513
<v Speaker 2>It's always,</v>

450
00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 2>always me and Sean.</v>

451
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like a thing we do and I do it.</v>

452
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 2>There's certain guys that I roll with that I do that too.</v>

453
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to do it too much to my students because then it seems like,</v>

454
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

455
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.780
<v Speaker 2>acting all arrogant against a guy that I,</v>

456
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.911
<v Speaker 2>he's one of my students,</v>

457
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 2>he's a blue belt or a white belt.</v>

458
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

459
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

460
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 2>that would look really douchey but playful.</v>

461
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>But because John Jack can smash me anytime he wants.</v>

462
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I talk like I pretend like I'm arrogant cause it's funny because he didn't do</v>

463
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:24.544
<v Speaker 2>anything you want.</v>

464
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 2>So no matter how Douchey I get,</v>

465
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>we know it's just doesn't make any sense cause he's killing me.</v>

466
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.053
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

467
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

468
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 2>so same thing here.</v>

469
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I have so much respect for him that,</v>

470
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 2>that I feel like I could just joke around with them and I don't want him to be</v>

471
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 2>mad at me.</v>

472
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good.</v>

473
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a good attitude to have man.</v>

474
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Especially after 11 years between the matches.</v>

475
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

476
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's cool that you,</v>

477
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

478
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you kept that feeling and you were completely destroyed,</v>

479
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 1>completely respectful,</v>

480
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.341
<v Speaker 1>rather uh,</v>

481
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>the entire way up to the promotion of it.</v>

482
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:54.071
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

483
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 1>your opinion of him,</v>

484
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:55.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

486
00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 1>you were like praising what a legend he is and you were very self deprecating</v>

487
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:03.330
<v Speaker 1>about your first victory to um,</v>

488
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>this was a 20 minute match and because there was no submission,</v>

489
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:06.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

490
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.361
<v Speaker 1>it's a draw.</v>

491
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Metamorris is doing a unique thing and they,</v>

492
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they've got the rules totally ironed out where they want him to</v>

493
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:12.401
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

494
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:13.234
<v Speaker 1>but what the,</v>

495
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is discourage people from point fighting.</v>

496
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is work towards submission at all times.</v>

497
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And you may get a submission and you may not get a submission,</v>

498
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:23.670
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

499
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.040
<v Speaker 1>the idea is you're,</v>

500
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing real Jujitsu here and they've accomplished that.</v>

501
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone was going for submissions,</v>

502
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:33.370
<v Speaker 1>whether it was Guy Mendez or half a Mendez or you know,</v>

503
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.211
<v Speaker 1>Kenan Cornelia's,</v>

504
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>everyone was going for submissions.</v>

505
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

506
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they didn't get them,</v>

507
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but it was really exciting because of that because guys couldn't just sort of</v>

508
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 1>wrestle to a certain position and then hold.</v>

509
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

510
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but if this was a scored match,</v>

511
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you would have beat them handily.</v>

512
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:50.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

513
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you swept him times,</v>

514
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you get side</v>

515
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 2>control on them and you had two near submissions.</v>

516
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 2>This is where he gets the under the crowd goes nuts because he has been fighting</v>

517
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 2>for the under hook for five minutes and he finally gets it.</v>

518
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And this is the position that we're in and our first match.</v>

519
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:04.680
<v Speaker 2>So all the grades,</v>

520
00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:05.001
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

521
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

522
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 2>he got the undercut so technical that he finally got it.</v>

523
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 2>And I still have them in quarter guard here.</v>

524
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 2>So I was a little worried,</v>

525
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 2>but you see what I'm doing with my right hand.</v>

526
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going under the knee right here.</v>

527
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I never really do that and I was keeping him from going,</v>

528
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 2>no hand pass.</v>

529
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.700
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

530
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.461
<v Speaker 2>oh okay cool.</v>

531
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>This is nice.</v>

532
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>He can't go no ham pass cause I'm holding his leg out and like that.</v>

533
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And I've never really done that before.</v>

534
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:28.461
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time,</v>

535
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:29.080
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

536
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 2>You see how I got my left hand?</v>

537
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.521
<v Speaker 2>She can't go.</v>

538
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:32.301
<v Speaker 2>No hand pass.</v>

539
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding open his legs.</v>

540
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.700
<v Speaker 2>So I felt comfortable even though I didn't have the under hook,</v>

541
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 2>I just had to somehow get a lockdown.</v>

542
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 2>So for my people,</v>

543
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:41.961
<v Speaker 2>they know,</v>

544
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 2>they see me fighting like this.</v>

545
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 2>All this is every day in the gym.</v>

546
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 2>This is how it looks.</v>

547
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I start in this position,</v>

548
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 2>this is how it looks.</v>

549
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 2>So to the Gracie side,</v>

550
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 2>they probably thought he was a winning right here,</v>

551
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

552
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.880
<v Speaker 2>My mom was freaking out.</v>

553
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 2>My mom thought he was killing me.</v>

554
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 2>This at this moment.</v>

555
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:02.630
<v Speaker 2>You got the lockdown somewhere in here you got the lockdown and when you got the</v>

556
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:03.464
<v Speaker 2>lockdown here,</v>

557
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>the crowd went fucking crazy.</v>

558
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.441
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

559
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:07.221
<v Speaker 2>I get the lock down.</v>

560
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 2>My guys go nuts.</v>

561
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>He gets the under hook.</v>

562
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 2>His crowd goes nuts.</v>

563
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I get the lock down.</v>

564
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 2>My crowd goes nuts that it was so crazy.</v>

565
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 2>The lockdowns way bigger though.</v>

566
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>The the what?</v>

567
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

568
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.120
<v Speaker 2>For folks who don't know the lockdown,</v>

569
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 2>when you got a guy who's really good at it and he has you in half guard and</v>

570
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 2>slaps it on your legs in jeopardy,</v>

571
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>you might tear your fucking knee.</v>

572
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 2>You're getting manipulated.</v>

573
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 2>You've got two legs against one,</v>

574
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 2>and when a guy's really good at it,</v>

575
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:32.504
<v Speaker 2>a guy like Eddie,</v>

576
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 2>when they're really good at it and they have two legs against one,</v>

577
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it puts you in a precarious position and it's,</v>

578
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.770
<v Speaker 2>it makes you vulnerable to a lot of different sweeps and here you're flipping a</v>

579
00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:41.931
<v Speaker 2>coin.</v>

580
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

581
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.880
<v Speaker 2>that's when the crowd went nuts.</v>

582
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.530
<v Speaker 2>We'll dude,</v>

583
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:44.770
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

584
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

585
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 2>you've got his leg in a mangled position here.</v>

586
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 2>There's electric chair right here.</v>

587
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think this was the plan.</v>

588
00:16:51.441 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 2>The plan was exactly what happened.</v>

589
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 2>That was the plan.</v>

590
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I was going to go,</v>

591
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 2>just do what I do at the gym every night.</v>

592
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly what I do every night.</v>

593
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 2>This is nothing new.</v>

594
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a special strategy for boiler.</v>

595
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 2>So that was John jocks.</v>

596
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Whole plan is to get me to do what I normally do.</v>

597
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.211
<v Speaker 2>The Best Shit.</v>

598
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:16.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a dude out there on him and then he reversed you for a second.</v>

599
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the leg on my shoulders,</v>

600
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 2>so I go let us go back and through them and get it.</v>

601
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 2>So it looked like he swept me.</v>

602
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 2>But I went back to put that leg back on my shoulder and I went rock right back</v>

603
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:27.374
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

604
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I do it all the time,</v>

605
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.921
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

606
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm in a position,</v>

607
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 2>this is where you rocked it with momentum cause you had full control over that</v>

608
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:35.970
<v Speaker 2>leg.</v>

609
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't on my shoulder.</v>

610
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I had to go back and scoop it up.</v>

611
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.290
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm on top and now I'm on a,</v>

612
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the electric chair on top and this is where I'm talking to him.</v>

613
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

614
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 2>you can't do anything here.</v>

615
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Just relax.</v>

616
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 2>This is where I rest.</v>

617
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I went through a lot of explosion and I right here I have control of this and</v>

618
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.420
<v Speaker 2>that's why he was doing that thing with his hands because people would want it.</v>

619
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Like why is he throwing his hands up in the air?</v>

620
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.741
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

621
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 2>like he did that a couple of times when you got him into side control.</v>

622
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>He did that and then I pass the guard pool in right here.</v>

623
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

624
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm still,</v>

625
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.910
<v Speaker 2>he's still stuck.</v>

626
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I got him in a cradle.</v>

627
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 2>But that makes sense now because everybody wondered why he was doing that with</v>

628
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:07.291
<v Speaker 2>his hands.</v>

629
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:07.621
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

630
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:07.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

631
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.613
<v Speaker 2>heuler was complaining.</v>

632
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:08.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

633
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 2>he's complaining because you were talking shit to him.</v>

634
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.280
<v Speaker 2>You're saying you're stuck here.</v>

635
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:12.841
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

636
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.660
<v Speaker 2>don't move.</v>

637
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.260
<v Speaker 2>He was saying,</v>

638
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.061
<v Speaker 2>I can't do nothing.</v>

639
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 2>He's holding me like,</v>

640
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 2>this is Jujitsu.</v>

641
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.331
<v Speaker 2>We're holding,</v>

642
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.164
<v Speaker 2>we're square,</v>

643
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 2>we're clenching and squeezing.</v>

644
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

645
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

646
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.190
<v Speaker 2>and he's all like,</v>

647
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 2>how could he complain about that?</v>

648
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.780
<v Speaker 2>He's totally a mobile here.</v>

649
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Even though I pass,</v>

650
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.551
<v Speaker 2>I pass,</v>

651
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I let go the lockdown and passed his guard.</v>

652
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 2>The reason why the past was guaranteed is because of the control I have on his</v>

653
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:33.041
<v Speaker 2>leg.</v>

654
00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I have a head and arm and the leg.</v>

655
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So that pass was easy.</v>

656
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:36.490
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I let go,</v>

657
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 2>the lockdown didn't want to let it go until I rest a little bit.</v>

658
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And then finally I let go the leg last and now I'm in side control.</v>

659
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 2>And here's the big transition.</v>

660
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was going to turn into me,</v>

661
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.410
<v Speaker 2>but he turns away.</v>

662
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

663
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.161
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

664
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Speaker 2>that's even easier.</v>

665
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 2>But he's rolling in a nice way,</v>

666
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.530
<v Speaker 2>but I had to turn it into 100% here.</v>

667
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.670
<v Speaker 2>So this is halfway.</v>

668
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 2>This is a neck crank that I do to get the guy to give me his back.</v>

669
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 2>So I'm net cranking them here and if he pulls his left arm all the way out,</v>

670
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

671
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I usually transition to the back and that's what he did right there.</v>

672
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm getting up and his left arms free now.</v>

673
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.750
<v Speaker 2>So all I gotta do is get up on my right knee and then swirled in the back.</v>

674
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm going to do here.</v>

675
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I wanted the twister.</v>

676
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.403
<v Speaker 2>That was the plan.</v>

677
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 2>The plan was to get them in a twister,</v>

678
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but he did a really good job of just shrugging me off.</v>

679
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 2>So now I gotta start over again.</v>

680
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:25.500
<v Speaker 2>So at this point I'm thinking this is what I'm really thinking.</v>

681
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

682
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I thought the most important thing is for me is to go out there and not get</v>

683
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:35.580
<v Speaker 2>smoked and not get tapped in 20 seconds or 30 seconds.</v>

684
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:36.414
<v Speaker 2>Cause that would be,</v>

685
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.620
<v Speaker 2>that would crush me.</v>

686
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I would be the worst possible thing.</v>

687
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:41.250
<v Speaker 2>So let's make sure that doesn't happen.</v>

688
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And if I lose,</v>

689
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.673
<v Speaker 2>if I tap,</v>

690
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 2>at least let me go out there and give,</v>

691
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.610
<v Speaker 2>we have 20 minutes.</v>

692
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's see some good 10 plan,</v>

693
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>a technique from my people just to show that it works if he taps it.</v>

694
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 2>So at this point I'm thinking I did so much to them,</v>

695
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:54.781
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

696
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:57.690
<v Speaker 2>That textbook 10 planet shit all the way through.</v>

697
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Note for note that I thought if the worst case scenario,</v>

698
00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 2>if he taps me on one second,</v>

699
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 2>at least I got some good shit in my mind,</v>

700
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:07.171
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>

701
00:20:07.171 --> 00:20:08.800
<v Speaker 2>cause that's how much respect I have for right.</v>

702
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

703
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 2>she could still get me,</v>

704
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:10.861
<v Speaker 2>I'm not over.</v>

705
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 2>We got 13 minutes.</v>

706
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So in my mind I already won.</v>

707
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.211
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

708
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 2>I won.</v>

709
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 2>So when you think that way and you're,</v>

710
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought I already did all this shit.</v>

711
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 2>So the worst case scenario,</v>

712
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:22.681
<v Speaker 2>he tasks.</v>

713
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Now I did a good job.</v>

714
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 2>So for some reason that made me just want to attack a more and go,</v>

715
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.080
<v Speaker 2>let's just keep putting this,</v>

716
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Speaker 2>just keep piling it up.</v>

717
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.863
<v Speaker 2>Oh here's another one,</v>

718
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.261
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

719
00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:32.220
<v Speaker 2>and see if I could do another one.</v>

720
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh here's another one.</v>

721
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.631
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

722
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:34.251
<v Speaker 2>I just change.</v>

723
00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:34.531
<v Speaker 2>Should I go?</v>

724
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

725
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go for a twister.</v>

726
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go for a vaporizer.</v>

727
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.350
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>

728
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.820
<v Speaker 2>when I get them in an electric chair,</v>

729
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.611
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't tap.</v>

730
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:42.990
<v Speaker 2>When I test this flexibility,</v>

731
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>if they don't tap,</v>

732
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I can just sweep them and get on top and set them up for a twister.</v>

733
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Which I already tried,</v>

734
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 2>but I made the decision.</v>

735
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:49.931
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

736
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

737
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.393
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>

738
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty good at shaking me off the back.</v>

739
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 2>If I just go to the vaporizer,</v>

740
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 2>it'll logistics schools,</v>

741
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:57.904
<v Speaker 2>the twister,</v>

742
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 2>and I do it all the time and that's good enough.</v>

743
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 2>So that was the plan.</v>

744
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:02.771
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

745
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 2>he's not stopping the electric chair,</v>

746
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a go back and get another another.</v>

747
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought about rubber guard for a second,</v>

748
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:07.811
<v Speaker 2>third,</v>

749
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:08.201
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

750
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

751
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 2>You see how he got the under hood?</v>

752
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 2>You see that I went,</v>

753
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 2>rubber guard locked down,</v>

754
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 2>whipped him.</v>

755
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.011
<v Speaker 2>He had the under hook,</v>

756
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but that whip boom,</v>

757
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I sucked and wham Bam.</v>

758
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a little whipped down Combo,</v>

759
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.280
<v Speaker 2>a very important combo to master.</v>

760
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>And now I got the under it.</v>

761
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:25.910
<v Speaker 2>So I thought he's not stopping the electric car tonight because if he would have</v>

762
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 2>been able to,</v>

763
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.750
<v Speaker 2>he can I,</v>

764
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to do electric chairs easy.</v>

765
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 2>So I knew I could just go back and more money in the bank.</v>

766
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I knew he couldn't stop it.</v>

767
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:34.510
<v Speaker 2>He just was perplexed here.</v>

768
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.111
<v Speaker 2>So I go,</v>

769
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:35.511
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

770
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

771
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I got to go to the vaporizer.</v>

772
00:21:37.011 --> 00:21:37.571
<v Speaker 2>I that,</v>

773
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:42.571
<v Speaker 2>which means I got to get his leg over to my left shoulder on the other side.</v>

774
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I need to get my head.</v>

775
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 2>I want me,</v>

776
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I just need to squash his leg down and get on top in a,</v>

777
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

778
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 2>leg drag type position,</v>

779
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 2>but a leg drag with a lockdown to maintain control.</v>

780
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'd go back to the electric chair for the third or fourth time,</v>

781
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 2>and I was really confident at this point.</v>

782
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I just knew he wasn't going to tap from the electric chair and I didn't want to</v>

783
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 2>pass this guard to get on top and try the twister.</v>

784
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I already made the decision.</v>

785
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 1>So for folks who don't know what we're talking about here,</v>

786
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.470
<v Speaker 1>the electric chair is a move where you've got a guy literally in a full split</v>

787
00:22:11.471 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're controlling his bottom leg and the other leg,</v>

788
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

789
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you're forcing it up towards his head.</v>

790
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't have the flexibility to tolerate it and a lot of times they</v>

791
00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 1>tap just from that.</v>

792
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:21.580
<v Speaker 1>You're like literally ripping their crotch</v>

793
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.513
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

794
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

795
00:22:23.581 --> 00:22:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And and right here,</v>

796
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what I didn't get,</v>

797
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get the position I wanted,</v>

798
00:22:27.331 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Speaker 2>so I'm letting him get on top so I can set it up again.</v>

799
00:22:31.981 --> 00:22:32.161
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

800
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:33.060
<v Speaker 2>he cannot stop it.</v>

801
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.500
<v Speaker 2>He can't stop my under hugs.</v>

802
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I already knew I had him beat on the inside.</v>

803
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.291
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to,</v>

804
00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:39.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to set it up again and go back to the cause.</v>

805
00:22:39.781 --> 00:22:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I wanted the vaporizer.</v>

806
00:22:41.071 --> 00:22:42.240
<v Speaker 2>He foiled to vaporize.</v>

807
00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I lost control of his leg,</v>

808
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.030
<v Speaker 2>so I got to start over again.</v>

809
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 1>So all of these times where he's on top,</v>

810
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 1>where the artists I called the tide has shifted back and forth.</v>

811
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.690
<v Speaker 1>This was just you resetting</v>

812
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 2>did he could not stop my half guard game.</v>

813
00:22:54.221 --> 00:22:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>

814
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.940
<v Speaker 2>the confidence just kept growing and growing.</v>

815
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 2>So even though he has the under a,</v>

816
00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.891
<v Speaker 2>I go watch,</v>

817
00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get the under hook back.</v>

818
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I was already getting it back.</v>

819
00:23:01.951 --> 00:23:03.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you could stop it.</v>

820
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

821
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I see that boom whip down.</v>

822
00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:06.150
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

823
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to keep doing it.</v>

824
00:23:07.141 --> 00:23:07.974
<v Speaker 2>He can't stop it.</v>

825
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

826
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.980
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm going to start all over.</v>

827
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I know he's not going to be able to,</v>

828
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.250
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to shake the lockdown.</v>

829
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.570
<v Speaker 2>The lockdown is too strong.</v>

830
00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 2>He was never close to ever getting his leg out.</v>

831
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I was so confident at this point I was getting a little gas and um,</v>

832
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I knew I could recover.</v>

833
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.290
<v Speaker 2>All I need is like a little time.</v>

834
00:23:25.291 --> 00:23:25.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

835
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

836
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.203
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

837
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.110
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

838
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.740
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

839
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.740
<v Speaker 2>hide the gaseous or the gas in is the fact that he hasn't stopped breathing.</v>

840
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying inside,</v>

841
00:23:36.511 --> 00:23:37.560
<v Speaker 2>but I would stop breathing.</v>

842
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

843
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.810
<v Speaker 2>like when Jason Walks into your house and you're in the closet and you're like,</v>

844
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.333
<v Speaker 2>but then you go,</v>

845
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

846
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I was doing that just so he wouldn't smell.</v>

847
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I did it again.</v>

848
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I knew I could do it again.</v>

849
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Now I've got to get his leg to the other side.</v>

850
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at it at sea.</v>

851
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding onto his leg.</v>

852
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I needed to get it to the other side of my body.</v>

853
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.511
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

854
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

855
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.531
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

856
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:57.741
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

857
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:58.521
<v Speaker 2>I lost it again.</v>

858
00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

859
00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 2>let me do it again.</v>

860
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.763
<v Speaker 2>So look at that.</v>

861
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.151
<v Speaker 2>He'll be doing it again.</v>

862
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:03.140
<v Speaker 2>They thought he reversed me.</v>

863
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:03.441
<v Speaker 2>But I go,</v>

864
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm just setting it up now.</v>

865
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I've got the leg over right there.</v>

866
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:06.494
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

867
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 2>That's where I want to be.</v>

868
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the transition right there.</v>

869
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

870
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.191
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

871
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:11.024
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go after it.</v>

872
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought about it for a second there,</v>

873
00:24:12.681 --> 00:24:12.981
<v Speaker 2>but I go,</v>

874
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

875
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

876
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to roll.</v>

877
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I can't just reach back for it.</v>

878
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I got to have set it up.</v>

879
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to set it up right here.</v>

880
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:19.251
<v Speaker 2>Squash them down.</v>

881
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it again,</v>

882
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 2>but then he stopped it right there and I go,</v>

883
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:22.731
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

884
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:23.870
<v Speaker 2>let me set it up differently.</v>

885
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 2>But then we got broke up here and this is where all the controversial,</v>

886
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 2>what the hell was going on here.</v>

887
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I knew what position we were in top stoner control,</v>

888
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:32.590
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

889
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.291
<v Speaker 2>I knew the position.</v>

890
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm there all the time.</v>

891
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.050
<v Speaker 2>He had no idea what I was doing.</v>

892
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.471
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

893
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't know that.</v>

894
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I knew.</v>

895
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.320
<v Speaker 2>He thought it was just some crazy,</v>

896
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 2>weird position.</v>

897
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.443
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

898
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.100
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know where he was.</v>

899
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.701
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

900
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:43.751
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

901
00:24:43.751 --> 00:24:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

902
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I would say I pulled guard right here and I was going to say here like gimme</v>

903
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.061
<v Speaker 2>your leg,</v>

904
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 2>let me throw it over.</v>

905
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get on top and we're going to go back and I show you exactly the</v>

906
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>

907
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I was going to show it.</v>

908
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do it from the top.</v>

909
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.751
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

910
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to do it from step one and then I was going to take them over and I</v>

911
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 2>was showing him the sweep instead of just getting in the position.</v>

912
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.320
<v Speaker 2>He's all confused.</v>

913
00:25:02.321 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 2>He don't know what's going on.</v>

914
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.243
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to,</v>

915
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.491
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

916
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you got to get your leg over it.</v>

917
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.910
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

918
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 2>he keeps refusing.</v>

919
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

920
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:09.861
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

921
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 2>he's not letting me get in the position and look.</v>

922
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:12.381
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

923
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:12.621
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

924
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:12.831
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

925
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

926
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.420
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't know.</v>

927
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Speaker 2>In his defense he didn't know the position,</v>

928
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:18.050
<v Speaker 2>but I know exactly what's going on.</v>

929
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.250
<v Speaker 2>He refuses to get in the position and then I'm just thinking I need a rest a</v>

930
00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:22.580
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

931
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.300

934
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 2>We're just arguing here.</v>

935
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.430
<v Speaker 2>He won't let me.</v>

936
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:29.264
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly that.</v>

937
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Then I decided at fuck that.</v>

938

<v Speaker 2>Fuck this shit.</v>

939
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.530

940
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.640

<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do?</v>

947
00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Halleck Hallux said stand them up,</v>

954
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.240

962
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And then the replay comes on and everybody looks at the replay and then heuler</v>

963
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.310
<v Speaker 2>just gets down and gets into position.</v>

964
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:01.521
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

968
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.470

00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Speaker 2>no resistance.</v>

972
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Once the video came out,</v>

973
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 2>they was trying to sneak that left knee in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

975
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.920

981
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.210
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have your risks before.</v>

982
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:20.751
<v Speaker 2>They didn't matter.</v>

983
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter.</v>

984
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.850
<v Speaker 2>None of it.</v>

985
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.260
<v Speaker 2>What I want here is I want him to push me away because I'm going to dip and</v>

986
00:26:26.261 --> 00:26:26.511
<v Speaker 2>roll.</v>

987
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Tuck and roll,</v>

988
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.060

989
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't tuck and roll and the whole time so I got to make it look like I want to</v>

990
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:35.990
<v Speaker 2>smash them and squeeze them cause I could pass it anytime.</v>

991
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.330
<v Speaker 2>The past is guaranteed.</v>

992
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you want the for sure pass or do you want to try to Tuck and roll and go for</v>

993
00:26:41.061 --> 00:26:44.610
<v Speaker 2>the kill right away and go after the vaporizer and I thought I'm going right for</v>

994
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:45.330
<v Speaker 2>the vaporizer.</v>

995
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Fuck passing his guard and then he recovers half guard and all that shit.</v>

996
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go for the kill right here.</v>

997
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'm on my side.</v>

998
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:52.284

1001
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.020
<v Speaker 2>All they gotta do is really get on top,</v>

1002
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 2>but I know I could get on top of them anytime I want.</v>

1003
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.200

1008
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 2>He can't get out.</v>

1009
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm in control here.</v>

1010
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 2>His legs are all mangled.</v>

1011
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 2>So what I want to do is turn to my right and roll on my left shoulder.</v>

1012
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.210
<v Speaker 2>But at what a resting,</v>

1013
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 2>all I'm doing is rusting.</v>

1014
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to turn to my right roll on my left shoulder,</v>

1015
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.070
<v Speaker 2>but I need him to push me.</v>

1016
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 2>So I say I'm cool.</v>

1017
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm selling the fact that I want to squeeze him and I want to see him to see,</v>

1018
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:25.650
<v Speaker 2>and I was pushing away.</v>

1019
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.513
<v Speaker 2>He bought it,</v>

1020
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 2>he bought the fact that I want us to please.</v>

1021
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.630
<v Speaker 2>So this is what I always do.</v>

1022
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm gurgling going like I hate this.</v>

1023
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:33.961
<v Speaker 2>Like I hate this,</v>

1024
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:34.261
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

1025
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 2>he's going to help me see how we helped me.</v>

1026
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:36.414
<v Speaker 2>And he pushed me through.</v>

1027
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.520
<v Speaker 2>He pushed me through this,</v>

1028
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:38.880
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1029
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Now you got this and I thought for sure he was going to tab.</v>

1030
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.680
<v Speaker 2>This is the vaporizer.</v>

1031
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 2>No one has ever not tapped to this.</v>

1032
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>This is in my arsenal,</v>

1033
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:48.690
<v Speaker 2>the nastiest leg lock.</v>

1034
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

1035
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a calf crank and it's a toe hold at the same time and he can't protect</v>

1036
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 2>himself with his other leg is other leggings were on his other leg so his other</v>

1037
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:58.224
<v Speaker 2>leg is useless.</v>

1038
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I can use both my arms as opposed to the calf crank from the truck.</v>

1039
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 2>The calf came from the truck.</v>

1040
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You can't use both arms for fear of getting arm barred with one of them who</v>

1041
00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.223
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

1042
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 2>so you need to protect that other leg.</v>

1043
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:10.501
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1044
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 2>he's got a free leg to break shit apart,</v>

1045
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 2>but in from the vaporizer he can't protect with his other leg.</v>

1046
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's out of the mix and you could use both arms because there's no arm bar and</v>

1047
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:20.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1048
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1049
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a leg compression and a told in one,</v>

1050
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.860
<v Speaker 2>it's the nastiest leg lock in my arsenal and the fact that his leg popped at</v>

1051
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:29.431
<v Speaker 2>least seven times,</v>

1052
00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 2>it was popping and cracking and I'm telling them right here,</v>

1053
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1054
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking him,</v>

1055
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:33.091
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1056
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:33.331
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1057
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:34.021
<v Speaker 2>we can end this.</v>

1058
00:28:34.021 --> 00:28:34.321
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1059
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1060
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.101
<v Speaker 2>see that.</v>

1061
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:35.311
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1062
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:35.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1063
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 2>we can stop this.</v>

1064
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.381
<v Speaker 2>It keeps popping.</v>

1065
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:37.591
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1066
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:38.161
<v Speaker 2>that's normal.</v>

1067
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 2>That's normal.</v>

1068
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I go with it keeps popping.</v>

1069
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1070
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 2>he refused the tap.</v>

1071
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.060
<v Speaker 2>He refused man.</v>

1072
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.081
<v Speaker 2>And I was yanking.</v>

1073
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:47.800
<v Speaker 2>So I thought I'm going to,</v>

1074
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I was doing things I never did to that they Bryson,</v>

1075
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I usually just grab the toes with both ends,</v>

1076
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 2>twist it in pool and it's really easy.</v>

1077
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 2>And the calf crank from the truck.</v>

1078
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Another thing that you need,</v>

1079
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 2>you need to stomp your left,</v>

1080
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.750
<v Speaker 2>the inside of your left foot with your right foot.</v>

1081
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.990
<v Speaker 2>You got to shove your leg deeper into the how nasty that looks.</v>

1082
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.230
<v Speaker 2>But in the CAF crank,</v>

1083
00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 2>you need to stop in this one.</v>

1084
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to stomp.</v>

1085
00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You could just keep your legs,</v>

1086
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 2>figure forward both arms.</v>

1087
00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 2>That's enough pressure.</v>

1088
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:17.401
<v Speaker 2>Just leave your legs.</v>

1089
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Figure four.</v>

1090
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.240
<v Speaker 2>But if for some crazy reason they don't tap like he did,</v>

1091
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.240
<v Speaker 2>then you would go to the stomp to add even more pressure.</v>

1092
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>But he was holding the Geek Pat so I could see he's holding my right leg.</v>

1093
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.480
<v Speaker 2>I need to use my right foot and stomp on the inside of my left foot.</v>

1094
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I need to pull it up and stomp on it and I can get his hands free.</v>

1095
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.430
<v Speaker 2>I can't get my leg free.</v>

1096
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 2>You see I was holding it but I mean is so I decided,</v>

1097
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:42.461
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1098
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:42.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

1099
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 2>I generally don't need to stomp on that foot,</v>

1100
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 2>so I'm still trying to make him tap like everyone else taps without it,</v>

1101
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 2>but see how he's holding it.</v>

1102
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 2>So I grabbed his foot,</v>

1103
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm twisting it and I thought there's like a minute left.</v>

1104
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1105
00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm want to give it everything.</v>

1106
00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I got one more time and I just grabbed his foot,</v>

1107
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:01.060
<v Speaker 2>something I never do when I twisted it and shoved it,</v>

1108
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.060
<v Speaker 2>like trying to shove it like in his ribs man.</v>

1109
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 2>And he still wouldn't tap and near the popping and it just,</v>

1110
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:07.923
<v Speaker 2>he didn't care.</v>

1111
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 2>He just kept going.</v>

1112
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 2>He knew that if he didn't tab it would be a draw and that's what he needed.</v>

1113
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't have you tap twice.</v>

1114
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>He tap him twice.</v>

1115
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.881
<v Speaker 2>He has nothing.</v>

1116
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he's holding onto my g pants there,</v>

1117
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 2>that's what's saving him.</v>

1118
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 2>You know he crazy.</v>

1119
00:30:20.771 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.930
<v Speaker 2>He's getting serious danger right here.</v>

1121
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.861
<v Speaker 2>If you had to do it again,</v>

1122
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 2>would you do it with the pants again?</v>

1123
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1124
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:26.141
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1125
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Because the key pad made those electric chairs so easy.</v>

1126
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 2>He could,</v>

1127
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.180
<v Speaker 2>he was never close to pulling his leg out of lockdown.</v>

1128
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.720
<v Speaker 2>So the traction is just unbelievable.</v>

1129
00:30:35.721 --> 00:30:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1130
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:36.880
<v Speaker 2>the pants,</v>

1131
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 2>the pants were bad for him and a lot of ways,</v>

1132
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:42.310
<v Speaker 2>but it saved them right here in this one position.</v>

1133
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:42.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1134
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:43.354
<v Speaker 2>it did save him,</v>

1135
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but I would,</v>

1136
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:44.681
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1137
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1138
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:45.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1139
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I would have went back to pants anyways,</v>

1140
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 2>that whole pants scandal thing,</v>

1141
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.913
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1142
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm using my hands to wear pants.</v>

1143
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.111
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1144
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:53.321
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1145
00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:55.390
<v Speaker 2>you go wear pants if you promise not to change your mind.</v>

1146
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I want her to change my mind.</v>

1147
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.731
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1148
00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:58.870
<v Speaker 2>you promise not to change it.</v>

1149
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 2>And then so they made me wear what I asked for.</v>

1150
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:03.783
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1151
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1152
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.273
<v Speaker 2>I met his lawyer,</v>

1153
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 2>his lawyer.</v>

1154
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 2>It ended up being really,</v>

1155
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:07.481
<v Speaker 2>really cool,</v>

1156
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1157
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.630
<v Speaker 2>The guy that was,</v>

1158
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1159
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>trying to protect a heuler from the pant.</v>

1160
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.220
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're twisting it do.</v>

1161
00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm pushing down and try to smash.</v>

1163
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously in some serious pain here,</v>

1164
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.481
<v Speaker 2>but it's incredible.</v>

1165
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:20.320
<v Speaker 2>He's not tapping.</v>

1166
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened to the knee?</v>

1167
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.493
<v Speaker 2>If you had to guess?</v>

1168
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Is this some damage?</v>

1169
00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1170
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he isn't.</v>

1171
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 2>He always pops and that's the thing I'll say about him is that he won't tap to</v>

1172
00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:30.990
<v Speaker 2>joint locks.</v>

1173
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Like you remember when a Sakharova got him in that Kamora yeah.</v>

1174
