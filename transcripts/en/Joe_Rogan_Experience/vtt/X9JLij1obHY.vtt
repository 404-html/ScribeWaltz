1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.463
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to update the people out </v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shut your phone off while you're a </v>

4
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>professional drone racer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all pretty weird out there.</v>

8
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.543
<v Speaker 1>It is very weird out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about how weird it </v>

9
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.293
<v Speaker 1>before the podcast about how it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like it's very difficult to keep </v>

11
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:27.091
<v Speaker 1>it together during these times and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep a reasonable position and to handle</v>

12
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.584
<v Speaker 1>all of the pressure of all the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that get upset at anything you do left </v>

13
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.354
<v Speaker 1>or right in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Centrist your two centers due to left </v>

14
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>you to write your unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're to reasonable.</v>

15
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>You're too nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not nice enough.</v>

16
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly I feel like I'm in a marriage </v>

17
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem like it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is why this is the era</v>

18
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>for disagree ability.</v>

19
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>If you're not easily swayed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're somehow a insensitive enough that</v>

20
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:58.254
<v Speaker 1>you just want to keep to first </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles wherever it is that you </v>

21
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.184
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the best hedge against </v>

22
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>getting swept up in the madness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

23
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.573
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess when I go metacognitive I look </v>

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>at my yearning for group belonging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I also watch my inability to belong</v>

26
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>to groups that say crazy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are,</v>

27
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>those are two conflicting feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes when people look at me</v>

28
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.911
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

29
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:24.744
<v Speaker 1>you're really contrarian and you have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy time standing up to the </v>

30
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>conventional wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think it's,</v>

31
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that true.</v>

32
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think when those two things fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside me,</v>

33
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.283
<v Speaker 1>a dialectically the disagree ability is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so strong because it's protecting a </v>

34
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.754
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so since everything already kind of </v>

35
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>fits together fairly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm much,</v>

36
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.663
<v Speaker 1>it's much harder to sway me because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of things I would have to move </v>

37
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>cognitively to accommodate a wrong idea.</v>

38
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.710
<v Speaker 1>This is quite large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems unnecessary,</v>

39
00:01:58.711 --> 00:01:59.544
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems like we should be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disagree on things and you should be </v>

40
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.314
<v Speaker 1>able to point out with reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtesy that there's something wrong </v>

41
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>with someone's idea and it not become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big personal thing.</v>

42
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>But oftentimes that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

43
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the things I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

44
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>we're exploring or what I would think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Heuristics,</v>

45
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of rules of thumb that </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked fairly well within some domain of</v>

46
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>definition and we've gotten so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these conflicting rules.</v>

47
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean the rules of thumb themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

48
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he who has the,</v>

49
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>his last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>conflicts with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing ventured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing gained or something like that.</v>

52
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

53
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

54
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.503
<v Speaker 1>I forget know there's the cautionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aphorism and then there's the be </v>

55
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aphorism.</v>

56
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't have a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorting out conflicts that occurred.</v>

57
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>The heuristic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you also have heuristics</v>

58
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>meant for social cohesion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicting with ground truth.</v>

59
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.103
<v Speaker 2>So this is why biology is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial because biology is a </v>

60
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 2>science that tells us many of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we wish were true or just not true.</v>

61
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.084
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think about Ben Shapiro's </v>

62
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't care about your feelings.</v>

63
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology cares about your feelings.</v>

64
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Just laughs at them and stomps on them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and makes them feel very sad.</v>

65
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also tries to explain your feelings,</v>

66
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

67
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really understand biology,</v>

68
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.254
<v Speaker 2>the world is so dark and so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and beautiful and crazy that it's very </v>

69
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.774
<v Speaker 2>hard to recover simple ideas about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>people should be once you really </v>

70
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>realized that are being apes has deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

71
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a very minimal understanding of </v>

72
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in that understanding,</v>

73
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.433
<v Speaker 2>I've come to accept some things just </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being a person that I never </v>

74
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:51.964
<v Speaker 2>considered before such as all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things that are running your </v>

75
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.130
<v Speaker 2>decision making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just what we're talking about.</v>

76
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.963
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the need to be in a group and all of </v>

77
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:06.471
<v Speaker 2>these are probably evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantages to fostering tribal behavior.</v>

78
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 2>So you could all work together and feed </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

79
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

80
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>this is always pulling at you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

81
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.263
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people give people hard time about </v>

82
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 2>virtue signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of gross.</v>

83
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>When someone virtue signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 2>but we understand what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gross because we've all done it.</v>

85
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the gross things about it.</v>

86
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>When someone is just like really trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to act like,</v>

87
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're disgusted by the way people </v>

88
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.504
<v Speaker 2>behave because they would never behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and they just want to let you </v>

89
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:33.901
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

90
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:34.734
<v Speaker 2>I'm above this type of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's most likely because they weren't </v>

91
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.913
<v Speaker 2>above that kind of behavior at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in their life or they're not </v>

92
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 2>currently really above that type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

93
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:44.314
<v Speaker 2>but they wish they were or the part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that speaking is the part that's </v>

94
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 2>above that behavior.</v>

95
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.633
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the part that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be operative after 11 on a weekend at a </v>

96
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Three shots in all bets are off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wheels are off the wagon.</v>

98
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>So I think we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't see ourselves.</v>

99
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.223
<v Speaker 2>We are permanently in our own blind spot</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the part of us that is just and </v>

100
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.750
<v Speaker 2>righteous and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

101
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>seems to know very little about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other part.</v>

102
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.693
<v Speaker 2>What's also this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this need to belong and need to be </v>

103
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:12.934
<v Speaker 2>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we work to be accepted instead of </v>

104
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.134
<v Speaker 2>work to be someone that you would want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a part of the group instead of </v>

105
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 2>being like really honest about who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and how you think and how you behave</v>

106
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.164
<v Speaker 2>and how you operate in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of doing that and trying to </v>

107
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>improve upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You try to project an image of this.</v>

108
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Well then here's a question for us.</v>

109
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Why is vice signaling so much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful than virtue signaling?</v>

110
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Vice signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a person who admits their problems,</v>

111
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 2>like an alcoholic who steps up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a real issue.</v>

112
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.863
<v Speaker 2>Could be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it could be sort of Dan Bilzerian </v>

113
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 2>type vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to know what I'm into.</v>

114
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:50.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm into hot chicks weed and guns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making tons of money and showing it </v>

115
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:54.881
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

116
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 2>he's super honest right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons.</v>

117
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>And you he's bulletproof in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't fuck with him.</v>

118
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

119
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just a playboy.</v>

120
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.544
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

121
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like girls.</v>

122
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>

123
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm nice,</v>

125
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>like he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talked to Dan Bilzerian.</v>

126
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 2>He's friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not bad guy.</v>

127
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.701
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

128
00:06:14.701 --> 00:06:15.071
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this post which was a,</v>

130
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>he was I think offering a hand to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman up the stair and said,</v>

131
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.000
<v Speaker 1>come with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ruin your life,</v>

132
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:23.490
<v Speaker 1>but it'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

133
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.383
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so disarming and I think that this </v>

134
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 1>is also partially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:32.740
<v Speaker 1>a secret to your success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you're a nice guy.</v>

136
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>You're really into fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hunt elk,</v>

138
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>you're clear about which ones you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill,</v>

139
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Speaker 1>which ones you want based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive cycle.</v>

140
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.843
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're promoting all sorts of things </v>

141
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:47.140
<v Speaker 1>that people don't want to talk about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly conscious level.</v>

142
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.974
<v Speaker 1>And it's produced an incredible level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust in an era where all of the virtue </v>

143
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>signaling gives way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you scratch any person a </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough below the surface,</v>

145
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.840
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see that they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning you about themselves.</v>

146
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And so the people who are the most sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of self critical,</v>

147
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>and this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I think I brought this up recently a on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter about Metta honesty,</v>

149
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.310
<v Speaker 1>where there was a in the Castro in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco,</v>

150
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:16.144
<v Speaker 1>there was a bar and restaurant that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising a free food naked servers </v>

151
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>plus false advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 1>it was just fun and playful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

153
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you had an instant desire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat there and to trust them.</v>

155
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that in this world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue signaling,</v>

156
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:35.764
<v Speaker 1>vice signaling is really the growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and that's what's working for </v>

157
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:43.420
<v Speaker 1>good people because they are more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch and you know,</v>

158
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.553
<v Speaker 1>they are going to lie to you and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do all the self interested </v>

159
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to</v>

160
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.620
<v Speaker 2>surprise you quite as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:51.454
<v Speaker 2>in the case of Dan Bilzerian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think he's going to lie </v>

162
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:54.970
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what he's doing.</v>

163
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I think what he's doing is living like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who's got $100,</v>

164
00:07:58.081 --> 00:07:58.914
<v Speaker 2>million dollars and happens to be 35 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old and likes to bang hot chicks </v>

165
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:07.360
<v Speaker 2>and fly around in private jets and live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some fucking house that he's got.</v>

166
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Speaker 2>He just bought some crazy house and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bel Air,</v>

167
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess with that weed money Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got.</v>

168
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.580
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you'd probably cost </v>
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000</v>

169
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>or something ridiculous like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking insane house,</v>

170
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's what he likes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy drives,</v>

171
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 2>likes to drive around Ferrari's and d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a nice guy,</v>

172
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.530
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

173
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:27.101
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where?</v>

174
00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:27.934
<v Speaker 2>What's what's wrong with this picture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with this picture is he's </v>

175
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 2>doing things that I look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this house.</v>

176
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.610
<v Speaker 2>What in the holy fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a golf course on his roof?</v>

177
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucking ridiculous house.</v>

178
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Look at this fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gives his address out,</v>

179
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 2>so that is address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty hard to hide that thing.</v>

180
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck would he give his address?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex?</v>

181
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in Bel Air.</v>

182
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this house.</v>

183
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

184
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 2>this is what he likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why is that bad?</v>

185
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

186
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>we only have</v>

187
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 3>100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If everything goes perfect.</v>

188
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you give a shit?</v>

189
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Like why does everybody get a ship?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they do give a shit.</v>

190
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.910
<v Speaker 3>They give a shit a lot because for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of folks that are working,</v>

191
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a good living,</v>

192
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 3>making 50 grand a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

193
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.890
<v Speaker 3>That's it</v>

194
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.723
<v Speaker 1>completely out of the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and his lifestyle wouldn't </v>

195
00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:15.130
<v Speaker 1>be sustainable for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because he's taking real risks.</v>

196
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.053
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get everybody stoned and then </v>

197
00:09:18.671 --> 00:09:21.700
<v Speaker 1>you take them to fire automatic weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the desert.</v>

198
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real risk.</v>

199
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And also the gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does a lot of like crazy gambling.</v>

200
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the thing about the </v>

201
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.313
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the unforgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is partially why I think your UFC </v>

202
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and Jujitsu life is that when you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the unforgiving,</v>

203
00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:37.360
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that guy,</v>

204
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.800
<v Speaker 1>that guy doesn't really know what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

205
00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the ring,</v>

206
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the man in the arena and you find</v>

207
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.160
<v Speaker 1>out very quickly whether or not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trash talking,</v>

208
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid off or it didn't.</v>

209
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think that many people have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the unforgiving.</v>

210
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll take them out on a hike </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

211
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say the Trinity Wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then two hours.</v>

212
00:09:57.821 --> 00:09:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll just sit down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go home.</v>

213
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking like,</v>

214
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.210
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're signaling something,</v>

215
00:10:04.211 --> 00:10:06.290
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no car service and there's,</v>

216
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 1>we're not calling a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

217
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:11.560
<v Speaker 1>it just that there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live in the social layer,</v>

218
00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you're surprised by the existence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unforgiving.</v>

219
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.920
<v Speaker 1>But oh well,</v>

220
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.040
<v Speaker 3>one on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to support people's ability to do</v>

221
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On one hand,</v>

222
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:24.974
<v Speaker 3>I want to support someone's ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit in front of a computer and whether </v>

223
00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:32.450
<v Speaker 3>you're working or you're writing code or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're writing a script or you're just a</v>

224
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.523
<v Speaker 3>fucking playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to support your ability to do </v>

225
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

226
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.470
<v Speaker 3>If you have the means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not,</v>

227
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your family is starving,</v>

228
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.430
<v Speaker 3>this is what you enjoy doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I care?</v>

229
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.270
<v Speaker 3>But as a person who's experienced a fair</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of adversity,</v>

230
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.220
<v Speaker 3>especially selfimposed adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

231
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I would tell you that you would benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>from it.</v>

232
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I've benefited from it and I think you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit from it too.</v>

233
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two hours into the hike says,</v>

234
00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:01.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to go home.</v>

235
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be.</v>

236
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:04.520
<v Speaker 3>That person just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

237
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.383
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're doing and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out how to do this and I'm </v>

238
00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:09.224
<v Speaker 3>going to show character and I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be proud of myself at the </v>

239
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.213
<v Speaker 3>end of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not might have to walk for six </v>

240
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:14.714
<v Speaker 3>hours and when it's all over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my legs might be shaky and I might have </v>

241
00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:18.104
<v Speaker 3>to sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that gatorade is going to taste so </v>

242
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:20.504
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be like the greatest </v>

243
00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:23.880
<v Speaker 3>gatorade of all time because he's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to drink and you'd be like,</v>

244
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or are in the shit out of this.</v>

245
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.103
<v Speaker 3>You're going to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we learned about ourselves </v>

246
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.520
<v Speaker 3>through especially self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

247
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.920
<v Speaker 3>any kind of adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

248
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.183
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming off of being evacuated from </v>

249
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:39.470
<v Speaker 3>the fires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was for me not that difficult.</v>

250
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not poor.</v>

251
00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:43.370
<v Speaker 3>I got a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought my family to the hotel.</v>

252
00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 3>We got safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got my dog to the,</v>

253
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 3>to the podcast studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's all right,</v>

254
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for those firefighters,</v>

255
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean 12 hour shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The blaze</v>

256
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 2>for people who lost their homes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them tried to save it.</v>

257
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:57.274
<v Speaker 2>There was a story about a guy in Malibu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the climbed on top of his roof with a </v>

258
00:11:59.051 --> 00:11:59.884
<v Speaker 2>hose and tried to fight off the fire and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got severe burns and he's in the </v>

259
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:04.020
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

260
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:09.030
<v Speaker 2>it's raining ash and these chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking fire on people,</v>

261
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:10.894
<v Speaker 2>these embers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're falling from the sky and this </v>

262
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 2>guy's trying to save his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

263
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>that guy literally went through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fires.</v>

264
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 2>He'll be a different person after this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no question.</v>

265
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 2>We've been in something of a reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>drought.</v>

266
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.660
<v Speaker 2>The number of people who have very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little relationship to reality.</v>

267
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I used to live in Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts and you'd,</v>

269
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.613
<v Speaker 2>you'd come in from Boston and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the science at fresh killed </v>

270
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>chicken bones about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

271
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Fresh killed chicken.</v>

272
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 2>But like chicken mcnuggets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody quite knows what,</v>

273
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 2>what part of the chicken isn't mcnugget </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

274
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just some abstraction that comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

275
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 2>And so I think we've gotten very </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorced.</v>

276
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 2>There'll all of these layers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>indirection between us and the world.</v>

277
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 2>And when a fire happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so overwhelming.</v>

278
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.250
<v Speaker 2>We were just choking on the SF smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

279
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 2>in the bay area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

280
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

281
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.383
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets real after having been unreal </v>

282
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:09.920
<v Speaker 2>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

283
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it's unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you,</v>

284
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 2>it makes you buck up like you gotta get </v>
<v Speaker 2>Outta there.</v>

285
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Like we got evacuated Thursday at 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

286
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 2>We were looking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

287
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:19.684
<v Speaker 2>we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit what you leave </v>

288
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go keep your body and go everything</v>

289
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:26.524
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's either replaceable or you don't </v>

290
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 2>really need it that much.</v>

291
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking get out of there.</v>

292
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.383
<v Speaker 2>And when you see that fire raging over </v>
<v Speaker 2>those hills and helicopters dropping </v>

293
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:38.050
<v Speaker 2>water on it and then another house </v>
<v Speaker 2>explodes because the gas line gets hit.</v>

294
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw that,</v>

295
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you see that you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

296
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough people in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>to save you.</v>

297
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough fucking firefighters </v>
<v Speaker 2>or cops.</v>

298
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:47.644
<v Speaker 2>There's too many houses as too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and a bunch of these houses are </v>

299
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 2>going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get the fuck out of there.</v>

300
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a certain.</v>

301
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.223
<v Speaker 2>I was with a bunch of my friends from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and my friend Tom Segura </v>

302
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.113
<v Speaker 2>and his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all stayed at the same hotel and we </v>

303
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:03.934
<v Speaker 2>felt we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like a tangible sense of </v>

304
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:09.370
<v Speaker 2>community with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this point.</v>

305
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine you go for a wedding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they house you with your third cousins.</v>

306
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.973
<v Speaker 2>People you barely know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky enough that the sewage </v>

307
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 2>system breaks and like stuff is leaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the ceiling and you guys all have</v>

308
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 2>to do heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff to save the house.</v>

309
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be closer to your third </v>
<v Speaker 2>cousin than you are to your uncle.</v>

310
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is this very strange feature of</v>

311
00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:31.984
<v Speaker 2>the world that is kind of a random </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrival of diversity is very often what </v>

312
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 2>bonds you to some particular human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

313
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you avoid adversity in groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole life,</v>

314
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.603
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't realize that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never fully activated as a human </v>

315
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 2>being or particularly,</v>

316
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

317
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.693
<v Speaker 1>if men I think don't form groups that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense fight or battle or contest </v>

318
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.793
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this very weird fact that </v>

319
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:07.001
<v Speaker 1>apparently humans are the only species </v>
<v Speaker 1>that organize a contests in teams.</v>

320
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 1>this is an intrinsic feature of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>human contests.</v>

322
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Do other animals have any contests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 1>just so they spiked chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.053
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have these incredible raiding </v>

325
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 1>parties were very methodical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

326
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll attack somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that they practice it.</v>

327
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.123
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

328
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160
<v Speaker 1>your red team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp,</v>

329
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.733
<v Speaker 1>chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the only ones that do stuff </v>

330
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:34.670
<v Speaker 1>like that that can communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

331
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Like dolphins can communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't do stuff like that.</v>

332
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you have individual sparring,</v>

333
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 1>like you'll have two bears learning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play with each other,</v>

334
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.533
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's safer to play with your </v>

335
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:46.544
<v Speaker 1>brother and childhood than it is to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly show up against some big ass </v>

336
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 1>bear and have to compete for females.</v>

337
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.633
<v Speaker 1>I had William von Hippel on a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days ago and he's the author of the </v>

338
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 1>social leap and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were actually talking about this,</v>

339
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.073
<v Speaker 1>about one of the things that made human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being successful as we came down from </v>

340
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:04.454
<v Speaker 1>the trees and started walking around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasslands is our ability to organize </v>

341
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 1>and to work and coordinate together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.433
<v Speaker 1>like African wild dogs are fairly good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this and you watch what they do in </v>

344
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:19.994
<v Speaker 1>their spare time very often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just take the piss out of each </v>

345
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>other so that they actually come to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other's age eight at a very high level,</v>

346
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in times of need.</v>

347
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.143
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.560
<v Speaker 1>when you're just hanging out around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire hose firehouse,</v>

349
00:16:31.561 --> 00:16:32.394
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really just giving each other </v>

350
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.614
<v Speaker 1>shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's something about the way </v>

351
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 1>in which we play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being kind of divergent from the way</v>

352
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:44.710
<v Speaker 1>in which we behave when we actually just</v>
<v Speaker 1>need each other and like,</v>

353
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be on that line,</v>

354
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:47.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

355
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

356
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 1>throwing burlap bags and I just need you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that thing.</v>

357
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And we were both facing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

358
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not.</v>

359
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be fighting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>militaristic situation.</v>

360
00:16:58.131 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

361
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.353
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the weird things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with all of this emphasis on </v>

362
00:17:05.061 --> 00:17:05.894
<v Speaker 1>care and feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that often men need to give each </v>

363
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 1>other shit in order to form very deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonds.</v>

364
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.833
<v Speaker 1>If I can't tease you and if I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the line is like there is this </v>

365
00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:19.040
<v Speaker 1>line which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

366
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:19.874
<v Speaker 1>that was way too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know that those lines exist and </v>

367
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 1>we sometimes have to go up to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we have to experiment by going</v>

368
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:26.960
<v Speaker 1>over them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if somebody says,</v>

369
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems very insensitive and my </v>

370
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:31.850
<v Speaker 1>response is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

371
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you're going to keep me from forming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep bond with that person.</v>

372
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:36.800
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know that that's how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

373
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're shielding their.</v>

374
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.643
<v Speaker 1>They're putting up their shield and </v>
<v Speaker 1>often is to project a certain image to </v>

375
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:46.240
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

376
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

377
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 1>they want to be taken seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want some respect.</v>

378
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

379
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>can't deal with you goofing on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true and goofing can go wrong,</v>

380
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.074
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that one of the things that </v>

381
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I've been fascinated by is where did all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this madness come from?</v>

382
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:01.224
<v Speaker 2>And I increasingly am wondering whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes from social and emotional </v>

383
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 2>learning that started to be taught in </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools around emotional intelligence.</v>

384
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 2>So this whole idea of eat q I think had </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot to it,</v>

385
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.180
<v Speaker 2>but not all the bugs were worked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of things that kind of are</v>

386
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhood of bullying might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually intimacy building.</v>

387
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.573
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if something turns into some </v>

388
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:27.060
<v Speaker 2>super disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deadly hazing ritual,</v>

389
00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:28.860
<v Speaker 2>we all say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you people doing?</v>

390
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.353
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's sort of three clicks back from </v>

391
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 2>that line and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>there was mild discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We humiliate each other a little bit and</v>

393
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 2>now we're friends for life.</v>

394
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

395
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.103
<v Speaker 2>the fear of the hazing ritual gone wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>may actually stop people from ever </v>

396
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.950
<v Speaker 2>actually making the really deep bonds to</v>
<v Speaker 2>last a lifetime.</v>

397
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that like everything else?</v>

398
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Some people are good at things and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people suck at it.</v>

399
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.043
<v Speaker 2>So some people are good at being silly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their friends and some people go </v>

400
00:18:58.681 --> 00:18:59.514
<v Speaker 2>too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

401
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you experienced that.</v>

402
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:01.854
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had friends who experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>that where they do a podcast on the </v>

403
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fuck with each other,</v>

404
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll have someone come up to them</v>

405
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:10.824
<v Speaker 2>that they don't even know right off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street and immediately say something </v>

406
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthlessly insulting to them.</v>

407
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.260
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

408
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.281
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

409
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 2>you do that shit on your podcast all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

410
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:19.171
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

411
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you.</v>

412
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:21.923
<v Speaker 2>We're not friends.</v>

413
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.823
<v Speaker 2>We're not bonding here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're walking up and saying something </v>

414
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>mean calling someone about Fatso.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

415
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not good at it.</v>

416
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.173
<v Speaker 2>And oftentimes that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a sign of social </v>

417
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lack of social intelligence,</v>

418
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 2>a lack of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

419
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.003
<v Speaker 2>who knows what's going on in their home </v>
<v Speaker 2>that might just be bad information from </v>

420
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.473
<v Speaker 2>parents and they're growing up in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment of a very low level social </v>

421
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now what we're doing is,</v>

422
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you're spot on,</v>

423
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 2>we're now going to try to readjust </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone around our weakest players.</v>

424
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the idea is that because that can</v>

425
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:01.944
<v Speaker 2>be said in a horrible way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to let anyone say </v>

426
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:06.730
<v Speaker 2>anything remotely adjacent to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

427
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 2>You can't do anything that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor to it.</v>

428
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 2>So you're just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

429
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you see that little patch of bad cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there,</v>

430
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>we're going to cut off your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

431
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:16.600
<v Speaker 2>in order to stop that cancer.</v>

432
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.463
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't we do something a little bit </v>

433
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:19.830
<v Speaker 2>more surgical?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

434
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.990
<v Speaker 2>and also there's some things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

435
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.813
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why we have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct to mock things because people </v>

436
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 2>get out of La and then they demand too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much goddamn attention and they become a</v>

437
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a,</v>

438
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.143
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe this goes back to hunting </v>

439
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:35.484
<v Speaker 2>parties and hunter gatherers were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one person who just wanted too much </v>

440
00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:38.831
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

441
00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking it up for this group </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>

442
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.753
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda what happened socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people claim these very ridiculous </v>

443
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 2>victim statuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

444
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>And there was</v>

445
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 3>a picture that I put up on my instagram </v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks ago of this guy.</v>

446
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.940
<v Speaker 3>He had this crazy makeup on and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this ridiculous description of himself,</v>

447
00:20:57.221 --> 00:21:02.221
<v Speaker 3>like non binary queer that also </v>
<v Speaker 3>identifies as a Muslim.</v>

448
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 3>And he was talking about quantum physics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and quantum physics.</v>

449
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Got helped him appreciate his queerness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I looked at that.</v>

450
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

451
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.833
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you're just fucking crying out </v>

452
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 3>for attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all I wrote was a makes sense,</v>

453
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.470
<v Speaker 3>definitely doesn't seem crazy and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>got mad at me for that.</v>

454
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 3>For something so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked.</v>

455
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I just peered into the fucking deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>dungeon.</v>

456
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:25.144
<v Speaker 3>That is the comment section for a moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I saw people like you would think </v>

457
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:30.160
<v Speaker 3>that the people that are most </v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to suicide,</v>

458
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:30.994
<v Speaker 3>you would leave them alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're cruelty is you know you're </v>

459
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>exposing your cruel to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

460
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.170
<v Speaker 3>that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy needs better friends.</v>

461
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Your friends are you going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're silly.</v>

462
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 3>You got crazy makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen Scott?</v>

463
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 3>You have a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this British Iraqi gay,</v>

464
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:50.210
<v Speaker 3>non binary and also identify as Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

465
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.000
<v Speaker 3>you need too much goddamn attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I'm saying.</v>

466
00:21:53.001 --> 00:21:55.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should kill yourself.</v>

467
00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:57.560
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be queer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be whatever you want to be,</v>

468
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.573
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hard to define yourself like that </v>

469
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.240
<v Speaker 3>is needy as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking annoying.</v>

470
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Your</v>

471
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.293
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your point is that you have to titrate </v>

472
00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 2>the negative feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

473
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 2>so what you did was you gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small dose and say,</v>

474
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.724
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might want to course correct a </v>

475
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:15.544
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that there's any course </v>

476
00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 2>correction that you're not sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrating this.</v>

477
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

478
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

479
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

480
00:22:23.261 --> 00:22:24.094
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to celebrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to celebrate so many </v>

481
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.764
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

483
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.770
<v Speaker 2>You can celebrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay,</v>

484
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't get mad if I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

485
00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 2>that might be a little nuts because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious little nuts.</v>

486
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a little nuts to paint your face </v>
<v Speaker 2>with glitter.</v>

487
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a little nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little nuts.</v>

488
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 2>If that was just a regular person who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

489
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work at JC Penney.</v>

490
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.100
<v Speaker 2>My name is Wendy and this is what I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wear on my face.</v>

491
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

492
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Wendy's a crazy bitch.</v>

493
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Look at Wendy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go look at Wendy.</v>

494
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Look at her face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is she doing?</v>

495
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.823
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

496
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.770
<v Speaker 2>She got fucking crazy glitter and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>hairs.</v>

497
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.320
<v Speaker 2>15 different colors a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

498
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:00.154
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this weird thing which sometimes </v>

499
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 2>is called Makilah phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear of cosmetics.</v>

500
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

501
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.813
<v Speaker 2>Lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

502
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Con?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like smoking,</v>

503
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.620
<v Speaker 2>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

504
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.663
<v Speaker 2>Fake eyelashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

505
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.513
<v Speaker 2>is the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that sometimes they look somewhat </v>

506
00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>normal and then suddenly it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate and the person just looks like</v>

507
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:24.190
<v Speaker 2>they've got crazy stuff stuck to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

508
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got crazy stuff's stuck to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

509
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I perceive it.</v>

510
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be in touch like they can't be.</v>

511
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Eric's got a problem with Makilah </v>
<v Speaker 2>phobia.</v>

512
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Never heard that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's freaking me out.</v>

513
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.600
<v Speaker 2>It has to be a phobia that it has to be.</v>

514
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Eric can't accept people who wear </v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup.</v>

515
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>And my question would be from first </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles,</v>

516
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 2>how do you tell who to have sympathy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>

517
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Because this has been somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>debilitating for me.</v>

518
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:50.961
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

519
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's been a real issue,</v>

520
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>like you've struggled with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It struck.</v>

521
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.873
<v Speaker 2>We have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You struggled with the feeling or </v>

522
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.740
<v Speaker 2>struggle with the fact that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody actually experienced,</v>

523
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.300
<v Speaker 2>if you remember Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faye Bakker,</v>

524
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.683
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she was famous for freaking people </v>

525
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:09.311
<v Speaker 2>out because she had no concept of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much a hangup is too much,</v>

526
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:10.604
<v Speaker 2>is too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what if somebody looks normal and </v>

527
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:14.414
<v Speaker 2>then you turn around and suddenly there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tammy Faye Bakker and you never can </v>

528
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:17.954
<v Speaker 2>predict when that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting question about </v>

529
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 2>do we accept the person who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I have this,</v>

530
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 2>it's just that some thing in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

531
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:27.944
<v Speaker 2>because you're a logical person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at this war paint that </v>

532
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 2>people are putting on and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the desire to do this,</v>

533
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.913
<v Speaker 2>but I do understand you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't understand actually doing </v>

534
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

535
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.003
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why it looks normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have the feeling that other </v>

536
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:46.154
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks very different than the way it </v>

537
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:48.040
<v Speaker 2>looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

538
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've just accepted it.</v>

539
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Maybe sometimes I accepted and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly,</v>

540
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shake it.</v>

541
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:55.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're shaking out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

542
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 2>like you see a movie where the suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mike is visible from the top,</v>

543
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>

544
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a movie and and that,</v>

545
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.750
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all have these weird quirks.</v>

546
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:13.751
<v Speaker 2>The question is with whom should we be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic and with whom do we do?</v>

547
00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:15.081
<v Speaker 2>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

548
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:15.914
<v Speaker 2>you're being judgmental with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a women's shoes that have gigantic </v>

549
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:20.954
<v Speaker 2>heals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those stilettos that they could barely </v>

550
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 2>walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one freaks me out.</v>

551
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>It freaks me out because I see women </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking in.</v>

552
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:27.464
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so crazy that this is a choice </v>

553
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:30.973
<v Speaker 2>that you are.</v>

554
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine I'm paranoid.</v>

555
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe I've seen too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical conflict.</v>

556
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:36.854
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine wearing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would physically compromised me to the </v>

557
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:40.334
<v Speaker 2>point where I literally can't run away </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't run away and those </v>

558
00:25:42.471 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're in like stilettos,</v>

559
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.463
<v Speaker 2>like these little things that you walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in and your feet are all smushed </v>

560
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:48.824
<v Speaker 2>in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically doing tiptoes </v>

561
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.270
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you go and you fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be killing you by the end of</v>

562
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.651
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

563
00:25:53.651 --> 00:25:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not running away.</v>

564
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 2>This is a wolf chasing you or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's something going down,</v>

565
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting away.</v>

566
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird,</v>

567
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.643
<v Speaker 2>like the desire to lengthen your legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to give this graceful appearance </v>

568
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:08.924
<v Speaker 2>called Lordosis behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Large doses or doses learning so much </v>

569
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:12.794
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So high heels were originally developed </v>

570
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:17.780
<v Speaker 2>for men to appear taller.</v>

571
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it was too pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taller only,</v>

572
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:23.320
<v Speaker 2>or if it was for writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

573
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe for a lot of people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cowboy boots.</v>

574
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.373
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they slip on like that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the horse box and takes off your </v>

575
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 2>boots fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to.</v>

576
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

577
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.343
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole idea behind the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>you slip on and slip off and they have </v>

578
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:43.190
<v Speaker 2>that heel is that wouldn't heal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll slips into the stirrups.</v>

579
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 2>So when you get when the Horse Bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to get dragged on.</v>

580
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.590
<v Speaker 2>You wanted that shit that just fly off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're on your back going,</v>

581
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:52.463
<v Speaker 2>Oh look at that horse go and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up your boots because they've </v>

582
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 2>fallen off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking horse is gone,</v>

583
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 2>but at least you're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

584
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died with his boots if you.</v>

585
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get.</v>

586
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

587
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that's like a gunfight type </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>

588
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you get dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you get dragged,</v>

589
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 2>horses are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run over rocks and shit,</v>

590
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People die all the time that are wearing</v>

591
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 2>regular shoes that shoved their feet in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stirrups and then you're stuck.</v>

592
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>That's why cowboy boots come off like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

593
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I used to ride horses,</v>

594
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:19.584
<v Speaker 1>we'd have the guy leading the trail </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like take us up to a gallop and </v>

595
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:25.260
<v Speaker 1>suddenly say emergency dismount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really terrifying.</v>

596
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

597
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to do it at speed very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

598
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:30.923
<v Speaker 1>But I think that high heels got taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>over by women because a lot of the </v>

599
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:38.130
<v Speaker 1>things that we claim that we like about </v>
<v Speaker 1>heels,</v>

600
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:39.550
<v Speaker 1>that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

601
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I do it for height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

602
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.203
<v Speaker 1>like the way it makes the leg look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably secondary to the curvature of </v>

603
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:47.814
<v Speaker 1>the back and the way in which that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically a associate associated with </v>

604
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 1>sexual receptivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's that particular posture that the</v>

605
00:27:57.331 --> 00:27:58.164
<v Speaker 1>heel keynotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way I read it is that the </v>

606
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 1>cost of the heel is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

607
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.433
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to do something that is </v>

608
00:28:05.611 --> 00:28:08.910
<v Speaker 1>clearly not comfortable or for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit in any other way.</v>

609
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.283
<v Speaker 1>So much so that you can tell that I must</v>
<v Speaker 1>be interested in sending a signal 100 </v>

610
00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:14.800
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

611
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.633
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the.</v>

612
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to deny the signal to.</v>

613
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So part of the signaling is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

614
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 1>these are actually my most comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

615
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 1>They always say that girls are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

616
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.020
<v Speaker 1>They're so comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are so comfortable.</v>

617
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how is that even possible?</v>

618
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't crocs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

619
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:32.190
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

620
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 1>but the deception has to be part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm like,</v>

621
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:37.524
<v Speaker 1>picturing</v>

622
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 2>that was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

623
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.490
<v Speaker 2>the deception has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

624
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to decide that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

625
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Shared deception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

626
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Because as the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to say,</v>

627
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so interesting.</v>

628
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a lie.</v>

629
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all lying,</v>

630
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's mutually understood is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

631
00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:02.841
<v Speaker 2>But when the girls are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls could say these are so comfortable</v>

632
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:03.684
<v Speaker 2>because they're not killing them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've accepted a higher level of pain </v>

633
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:08.364
<v Speaker 2>tolerance with footwear than men have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had a just jam my feet into </v>

634
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.300
<v Speaker 2>something pointy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some point.</v>

635
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish dancer type shoes.</v>

636
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 2>It would hurt after awhile you ever wear</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tie?</v>

637
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.683
<v Speaker 2>I hate those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's some kind of uncomfortable </v>

638
00:29:25.381 --> 00:29:27.790
<v Speaker 2>thing that we do to ourselves as men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

639
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I used to have to wear one when I drove </v>
<v Speaker 2>limos.</v>

640
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.953
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I've definitely worn one since </v>

641
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:33.930
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very rarely,</v>

642
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 2>very rarely can kill you pretty easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a tie.</v>

643
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone has a tie on and I grab </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hold their Thai boy,</v>

644
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 2>unless you're a lot bigger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might kill you.</v>

645
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Got a hold of your tie ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hard thing to shake loose.</v>

646
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 2>It's really strong like you could you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good tie is not going to rip.</v>

647
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Someone gets a hold of your tie at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>not just twists and holds onto you.</v>

648
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 2>All they have to do is hold onto you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grab an arm,</v>

649
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 2>and just grab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap their legs around you and hold onto</v>

650
00:30:01.181 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 2>that ty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a dead man.</v>

651
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Your debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>

652
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 2>You're giving them a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heal you all the time.</v>

653
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've convinced me no more ties.</v>

654
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I just grabbed that and just look and </v>
<v Speaker 2>twist.</v>

655
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.960
<v Speaker 2>You don't have much time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

656
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have much time to get this arm</v>

657
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:17.730
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your such a UFC.</v>

658
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Have to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Jujitsu spin.</v>

659
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.501
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

660
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:21.334
<v Speaker 2>You don't wear clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be able to grab a hold of </v>

661
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 2>someone's clothing like like a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a leather jacket.</v>

662
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking shit and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>leather jacket on,</v>

663
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you're with a guy who knows judo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are beyond fucked.</v>

664
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.023
<v Speaker 2>You don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy might as well have cannons </v>

665
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 2>coming out of his body like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doomed.</v>

666
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.303
<v Speaker 2>You're 100 percent doom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to grab that leather jacket </v>

667
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:42.064
<v Speaker 2>and basically this handles and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna throw you up in the air and he's </v>

668
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:49.140
<v Speaker 2>going to hit you with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole world is below it.</v>

669
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:49.983
<v Speaker 2>He's going to drive you into the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're so fucked and you don't even </v>

670
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 2>realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

671
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:58.360
<v Speaker 2>how often do you end up in fistfights?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

672
00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.933
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

673
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.833
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have nothing to do with </v>

674
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:02.290
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

675
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.123
<v Speaker 2>I just get away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never want to get into </v>

676
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.543
<v Speaker 2>fistfights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fascinating to me about this </v>

677
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:08.554
<v Speaker 2>sort of the world here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always talking about fighting and </v>

678
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 2>what can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in in our world,</v>

679
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 2>there's like almost none of this in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

680
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.260
<v Speaker 2>relatively boring white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle age.</v>

681
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 2>You ever go on Worldstar hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Shit's all day everyday.</v>

682
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.680
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of videos you most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time nothing happens,</v>

683
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.663
<v Speaker 2>but the one time when Shit does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know how to defend </v>

684
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really fucked.</v>

685
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.690
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is true,</v>

686
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:38.524
<v Speaker 2>but then the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that in all the practicing that you </v>

687
00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:41.404
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also exposing yourself to the </v>

688
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>potential for injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

689
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.810
<v Speaker 2>So there's a question as to whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safer.</v>

690
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 2>If you spend all of your time in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

691
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if something happens?</v>

692
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.793
<v Speaker 2>I want to be prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the preparation for it is itself </v>

693
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:58.300
<v Speaker 2>potentially fairly hazardous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unquestionable,</v>

694
00:31:58.301 --> 00:31:59.134
<v Speaker 2>but isn't that just like the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>sits on the couch and never goes into </v>

695
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 2>the woods because he doesn't want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired.</v>

696
00:32:02.201 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I know it's very similar because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>here we are,</v>

697
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm 51 years old and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it all works.</v>

698
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 2>So even though I've been injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right here.</v>

699
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Everything works like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also got of this shit fixed.</v>

700
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>What if the UFC thing was like bold and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting when you were a young guy,</v>

701
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:20.164
<v Speaker 2>do you think you would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have 100 percent done it and I </v>

702
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>probably would have a much harder time </v>
<v Speaker 2>having this conversation.</v>

703
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

704
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

705
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.833
<v Speaker 2>So I think you hit the sweet spot where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got the skills you've been in </v>

706
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.223
<v Speaker 2>training idiom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really know what you're talking </v>

707
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:35.074
<v Speaker 2>about and you're getting front row seats</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not actually having to have your </v>

708
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 2>brain particularly take the pounding.</v>

709
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is the unfortunate reality that</v>

710
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 3>every fighter accepts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting away from that.</v>

711
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an absolute possibility,</v>

712
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also your joints.</v>

713
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.553
<v Speaker 3>A big part is your back and your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know many guys that have neck </v>

714
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.333
<v Speaker 3>impingements and disc herniations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fused neck disks and then nerve pinched </v>

715
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 3>nerves or impinged to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have atrophy in their arms.</v>

716
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.463
<v Speaker 3>I know several guys who have that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have one arm that's smaller than </v>

717
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:12.614
<v Speaker 3>the other arm and it severely impedes </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ability to move and they used to </v>

718
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:17.204
<v Speaker 3>be world champions to guys that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been on the show bus route and Pat </v>

719
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Miletich two of the greatest of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

720
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.393
<v Speaker 3>Both guys have one small arm in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular size arm because of neck </v>

721
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.283
<v Speaker 3>impingements who their nerves are </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally pinched down by all the </v>

722
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.860
<v Speaker 3>swelling and scar tissue and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged discs.</v>

723
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well since we became friends,</v>

724
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I started just casually looking at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and it's utterly fascinating.</v>

725
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like it.</v>

726
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you Jitsu world?</v>

727
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I think you would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two different worlds,</v>

728
00:33:47.961 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the MMA world which incorporates</v>

729
00:33:49.851 --> 00:33:50.684
<v Speaker 3>all the different martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the Jujitsu world and </v>

730
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:56.900
<v Speaker 3>the Jujitsu world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you would find seek out.</v>

731
00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would love it because it's basically</v>

732
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>to call it chest is not quite fair </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's more complex than chess.</v>

733
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 3>There's much more going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Visa freedom are so high,</v>

734
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.353
<v Speaker 3>but it's also easier to win if someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than chess because even if </v>

735
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:14.090
<v Speaker 3>someone is fairly competent in chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll take a few moves to beat them.</v>

736
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.343
<v Speaker 3>In Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone's fairly competent in the </v>

737
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:19.320
<v Speaker 3>other one is a master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it probably crush your very quickly,</v>

738
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.563
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you watch two really high level </v>

739
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:23.684
<v Speaker 3>guys trying to set each other up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this crazy rolling exercise and </v>

740
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:28.813
<v Speaker 3>leverage and position and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of moves that Eddie Bravo </v>

741
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 3>versus a crazy crazy.</v>

742
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to even know what's going on.</v>

743
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know,</v>

744
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:39.914
<v Speaker 3>it's one of my more difficult challenges</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being in a commentator is when the </v>

745
00:34:44.871 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 3>fight goes to the ground explaining to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people watching at home.</v>

746
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:51.560
<v Speaker 3>What he wants to do right now is get his</v>
<v Speaker 3>right leg over his arm and as soon as he</v>

747
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:52.880
<v Speaker 3>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that arm is stuck.</v>

748
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:54.410
<v Speaker 3>He's in trouble right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:57.210
<v Speaker 3>and like to try to explain that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people so they can follow along.</v>

750
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

751
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.423
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

752
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.800
<v Speaker 3>And he's going to grab that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's arch arches back any tapped?</v>

753
00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.240
<v Speaker 3>And people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

754
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.193
<v Speaker 3>and it gets people really excited about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu because they see that and you </v>

755
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:05.631
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

756
00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:08.270
<v Speaker 3>this is like really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's got,</v>

757
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.860
<v Speaker 3>there's like a dance he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other guy's trying to resist.</v>

758
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.743
<v Speaker 3>But the first time I saw the gracie </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakdown of particular fights where </v>

759
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 3>they've committed to memory every move.</v>

760
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:17.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like replaying the great games of </v>

761
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.150
<v Speaker 3>like morphy or Combo Banca chess and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just thinking,</v>

762
00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:23.961
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

763
00:35:23.961 --> 00:35:25.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the evergreen game,</v>

764
00:35:25.081 --> 00:35:29.090
<v Speaker 3>there's the moral game and that that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me is fascinating,</v>

765
00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:29.924
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually more interesting to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC arena because of the fact </v>

766
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 3>that that's only a component and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

767
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.700
<v Speaker 3>What I didn't understand was how much we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could get close to unrestricted fighting</v>

768
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.383
<v Speaker 3>and still have people fairly dependably </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive with minimal obvious disfigure </v>

769
00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 3>disfigurements there is disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would there are some.</v>

770
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 3>We could even be safer if we eliminated </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight cutting.</v>

771
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 3>The weight cutting is the number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>health issue in the sport in my opinion.</v>

772
00:36:00.671 --> 00:36:01.504
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number two is the brain damage and the </v>

773
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:04.040
<v Speaker 3>impact and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

774
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.760
<v Speaker 3>broken bones and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

775
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but the number one is weight cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so unnecessary.</v>

776
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 3>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such an issue that needs to be addressed</v>

777
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 3>because these guys want to compete at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest weight possible.</v>

778
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.950
<v Speaker 3>So do you know how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

779
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.883
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say if you were going to compete in the </v>

780
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:20.630
<v Speaker 3>170 pound division,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you actually weighed one 90,</v>

781
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:21.763
<v Speaker 3>which you would do is you would wait </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you would follow a pretty strict </v>

782
00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:24.954
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep your body weight in your fat a </v>

783
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.024
<v Speaker 3>certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when it comes down to a few </v>

784
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.990
<v Speaker 3>days before you would dehydrate yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty radically.</v>

785
00:36:31.991 --> 00:36:32.824
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then rehydrate yourself </v>

786
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:34.584
<v Speaker 3>scientifically using the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of guys like George </v>

787
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.423
<v Speaker 3>Lockhart guys who are experts in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll give you the exact </v>

788
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:41.274
<v Speaker 3>right amount of nutrients right around </v>
<v Speaker 3>of potassium and zinc and they want to </v>

789
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 3>replenish all of your electrolytes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get you in a perfect balance,</v>

790
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:47.274
<v Speaker 3>but you're still compromised and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a guy like a George Lockhart </v>

791
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:51.594
<v Speaker 3>or someone who's a real expert in </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and understands biology and </v>

792
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:55.134
<v Speaker 3>can get you back into that position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're most likely gonna compete </v>

793
00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.314
<v Speaker 3>compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to accept that </v>

794
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.563
<v Speaker 3>significant compromising because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a bigger person than the </v>

795
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:05.490
<v Speaker 3>person you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also,</v>

796
00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.493
<v Speaker 3>like in boxing in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of deaths have </v>

797
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:10.704
<v Speaker 3>occurred in the lighter weight divisions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of it is not just because of </v>

798
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:14.214
<v Speaker 3>the head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because it's head trauma to someone </v>

799
00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:16.494
<v Speaker 3>who's dehydrated.</v>

800
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.700
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

801
00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

802
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 3>It sucks and it's contrary to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts is supposed to be about.</v>

803
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Martial arts supposed to be about skill </v>
<v Speaker 3>for skill.</v>

804
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:25.314
<v Speaker 3>It's not supposed to be about cheating </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that cheating thing is like you're </v>

805
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:30.510
<v Speaker 3>dehydrating yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like sanctioned cheating.</v>

806
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.680
<v Speaker 3>You're saying you're 170 pounds if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

807
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.523
<v Speaker 3>if you say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 170 pound champion and get on the </v>

808
00:37:36.631 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 3>scale is one 93.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck's going on?</v>

809
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.640
<v Speaker 3>This isn't a 170 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now frustrating if I want to meet you in</v>

810
00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:43.920
<v Speaker 3>a different class like I wanted to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>you my whole life,</v>

811
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 3>but we're really separated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

812
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:47.760
<v Speaker 3>you can lose weight the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

813
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:50.130
<v Speaker 3>if somebody wants to compete at 170 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>

814
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 3>in my humble opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should actually weighed 170 pounds.</v>

815
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.773
<v Speaker 3>My friend Cam Haynes is a ultra marathon</v>
<v Speaker 3>runner and one of the things that he </v>

816
00:37:58.591 --> 00:38:01.730
<v Speaker 3>does when he gets ready for ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathons is he loses bodyweight,</v>

817
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.330
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have any body weight to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose.</v>

818
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.343
<v Speaker 3>So he'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll burn 300 calories and eat 2000 </v>

819
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:07.974
<v Speaker 3>calories and that's how he loses weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lets his body eat itself so he gets </v>

820
00:38:11.461 --> 00:38:14.700
<v Speaker 3>down to the sixties and that's when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>runs these gigantic long races,</v>

821
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 3>like 240 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know he's done this.</v>

822
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.940
<v Speaker 3>You can do this like you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dehydrate yourself,</v>

823
00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:24.270
<v Speaker 3>but they choose to dehydrate themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they replenish and then they get</v>

824
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 3>much bigger when they get inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon.</v>

825
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 3>When he's 65,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's actually one 65.</v>

826
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 3>That's just what he weighs and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to run 240 miles,</v>

827
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.113
<v Speaker 3>so he does it through discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys that are it and it's not </v>

828
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 3>their fault because it's already been </v>
<v Speaker 3>established.</v>

829
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.273
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been there for years and years and </v>

830
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:41.763
<v Speaker 3>years and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sanctioned cheating and everybody </v>

831
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:44.584
<v Speaker 3>does it and it's the worst part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport because it's really damaging to </v>

832
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 3>your kidneys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible for your organs.</v>

833
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:51.523
<v Speaker 3>Your body starts to shut down when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it too often and your body doesn't </v>

834
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:55.054
<v Speaker 3>want to lose weight anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it starts to really hold onto that </v>

835
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 3>water and guys fall asleep and pass out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bang their heads off.</v>

836
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:02.284
<v Speaker 3>Walls and fights get canceled like pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship level flights get canceled </v>

837
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.300
<v Speaker 3>because guys blackout and crack their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head off the wall and this is.</v>

838
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.230
<v Speaker 3>This has happened in the in the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

839
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:12.483
<v Speaker 3>It's just super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super unnecessary and unfortunate and </v>

840
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 3>part of it is because there's not enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight classes.</v>

841
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.640
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

842
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 3>there's 1:55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's one 70.</v>

843
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 3>The difference from 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one 70 is not just 15 pounds because</v>

844
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 3>if you actually weigh 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guys dropping down to one 70,</v>

845
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.743
<v Speaker 3>that motherfucker could be one 90 plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's just figuring out a way to cut </v>

846
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.350
<v Speaker 3>weight to get down to there and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens all the time.</v>

847
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.060
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with,</v>

848
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be 25,</v>

849
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:43.800
<v Speaker 3>30 pounds difference between you two </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys if you're,</v>

850
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.260
<v Speaker 3>if you actually way with the weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes when you get into the octagon,</v>

851
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 3>so people are forced to drop weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're forced to go lower.</v>

852
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.510
<v Speaker 3>If they want to compete at a world class</v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

853
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 3>they're forced to take this extra risk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it could be mitigated.</v>

854
00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:57.754
<v Speaker 3>It could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could all be stopped by hydration </v>

855
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The UFC could step in.</v>

856
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.870
<v Speaker 3>All the athletic commissions could step </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and say,</v>

857
00:40:04.871 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 3>enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to fight it,</v>

858
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:07.504
<v Speaker 3>what your way and we're going to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>you more weight classes so you could </v>

859
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:10.534
<v Speaker 3>figure out what's the wait for you to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>best at and I hope it doesn't take </v>

860
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:14.764
<v Speaker 3>someone dying before they figured this </v>
<v Speaker 3>out because it's one of those things </v>

861
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 3>that people have done like circumcision.</v>

862
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 3>They've done it forever so they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep doing it,</v>

863
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 3>but if they just started doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>

864
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did you cut that baby's Dick?</v>

865
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

866
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:29.340
<v Speaker 3>I've always cut babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ticks.</v>

867
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.880
<v Speaker 3>I've been cutting babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick's for years.</v>

868
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Like this is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a yiddish get used to it.</v>

869
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just yiddish mean I'm Catholic.</v>

870
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.144
<v Speaker 3>My Dick are cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like practiced across the board </v>

871
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:45.841
<v Speaker 3>under the guise of being sanitary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's prevention of AIDS.</v>

872
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.360
<v Speaker 3>All these stupid reasons to cut dicks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

873
00:40:48.361 --> 00:40:49.194
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a tradition that doesn't make </v>

874
00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 3>any goddamn sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

875
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not the best analogy to weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting</v>

876
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.020
<v Speaker 1>the cutting dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to pick up on an analogy which</v>

877
00:40:59.021 --> 00:40:59.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're trying to describe the </v>

878
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:03.240
<v Speaker 1>ground game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

879
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.953
<v Speaker 1>it's super tough for a lay audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the picture doesn't necessarily </v>

880
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:09.424
<v Speaker 1>match what you're seeing because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>layer of expertise makes a bunch of </v>

881
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:17.020
<v Speaker 1>random arm movements and head movements </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hip movements into something else.</v>

882
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:18.423
<v Speaker 1>We have the same problem in like math </v>
<v Speaker 1>and physics where everybody wants to </v>

883
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:25.870
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have been listening to</v>

884
00:41:25.871 --> 00:41:26.704
<v Speaker 1>like the physicists on your program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have many </v>

885
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:29.104
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so confusing to figure out how </v>

886
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 1>to talk to the world about things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

887
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.093
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just curious as if you saw a </v>

888
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:41.630
<v Speaker 1>parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

889
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 1>in those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are certainly very high art forms.</v>

890
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

891
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Sean Carroll has done a really good job </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying to explain things.</v>

892
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson's done a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>job trying to explain things.</v>

893
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

894
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 1>the explanation of gauge symmetry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Krauss on your show,</v>

895
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.143
<v Speaker 1>which is like from two to my way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking when the most important </v>

896
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:02.654
<v Speaker 1>principles in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have no idea what the fuck he </v>

897
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:05.910
<v Speaker 1>said exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well like,</v>

898
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.910
<v Speaker 1>well I read his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And after I read his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the number one question I had.</v>

900
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:11.354
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

901
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I need you to explain to me what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gates symmetry?</v>

902
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that he didn't.</v>

903
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he expected you to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bust it out.</v>

904
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>

905
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:26.150
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's so hard to like,</v>

906
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one of my.</v>

907
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I will get back together.</v>

908
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Symmetry maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like when people say the universe is</v>

909
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:33.340
<v Speaker 1>expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

910
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

911
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:41.040
<v Speaker 1>every smart person says into what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

912
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's the universe.</v>

913
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:44.620
<v Speaker 1>What is it expanding into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

914
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And where's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

915
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.203
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense because the </v>

916
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 1>linguistics of the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding,</v>

917
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.333
<v Speaker 1>isn't really what the what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying the matter in the </v>

918
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 1>universe is moving outwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what the universe is expanding?</v>

919
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.363
<v Speaker 1>What it means is I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinite universe is getting more </v>

920
00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:03.000
<v Speaker 1>infant her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

921
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So first of all was that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you say that?</v>

922
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to be silly to sativa is </v>

923
00:43:11.161 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 1>kicking in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

924
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you think about this bottle,</v>

925
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:15.663
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the slices of the bottle that are </v>

926
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.073
<v Speaker 1>expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think of the bottle is the </v>

927
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 1>universe the bought the bottle isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding.</v>

928
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just the cross sections that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding.</v>

929
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.583
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what they really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they really mean is something like </v>

930
00:43:32.511 --> 00:43:36.430
<v Speaker 1>the spacetime metric on space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cross sections has a,</v>

931
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 1>it's volume for them when integrated is </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher or something like that.</v>

932
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mathematical statement,</v>

933
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.830
<v Speaker 1>but the universe is expanding is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful to me.</v>

934
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Like if I wasn't able to read the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I don't get it.</v>

935
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get anything quite honestly.</v>

936
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being self deprecating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get the Big Bang.</v>

937
00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it at all.</v>

938
00:43:58.241 --> 00:43:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

939
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's what somebody should tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

940
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two kinds of singularity's </v>

941
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 1>when you try to solve Einstein's field </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations for gravity.</v>

942
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:11.630
<v Speaker 1>So gravity as a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein tells us pretty much,</v>

943
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we think gravity is the curvature </v>

944
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 1>of space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we try to solve his equations,</v>

945
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.813
<v Speaker 1>we get these black hole singularities </v>
<v Speaker 1>which called swartz chilled </v>

946
00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.133
<v Speaker 1>singularities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let me get this initial singularity </v>

947
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:25.993
<v Speaker 1>a which we associate back to the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang with the freedmen Walker Robertson </v>

948
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 1>model in some.</v>

949
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Those singularities are indications to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us that we're not at the end of physics </v>

950
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and that Einstein's equations aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't the real story.</v>

951
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.343
<v Speaker 1>And so rather than sort of saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a pretty good model up until </v>

952
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:45.900
<v Speaker 1>this point and then we kind of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what happened,</v>

953
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:46.734
<v Speaker 1>then we have the observational thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would map to the big bang and </v>

954
00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:51.360
<v Speaker 1>then we have the model thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would map to the big bang.</v>

955
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.493
<v Speaker 1>And to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that are our models </v>

956
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:55.644
<v Speaker 1>don't make sense past a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we're having this conversation </v>

957
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.300
<v Speaker 1>past the point where we're pretty sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't make sense.</v>

958
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:05.510
<v Speaker 1>That would be much more honest to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because we have this desire to,</v>

959
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:10.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to blow people's minds gratuitously,</v>

960
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody wants to.</v>

961
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.540
<v Speaker 1>How did everything begin and where are </v>
<v Speaker 1>we?</v>

962
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Who are we in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to sort of answer more of that </v>

963
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:20.760
<v Speaker 1>than we probably should.</v>

964
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way.</v>

965
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.003
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an alternate spin on </v>

966
00:45:27.931 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

967
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So typically people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 1>the mind blowing thing about quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics is that it's probabilistic and</v>

969
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.920
<v Speaker 1>that is kind of mind blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually say it differently,</v>

970
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:41.903
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look in classical mechanics like newton </v>

971
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.650
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we feel more comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

972
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you have good questions and bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

973
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Like if you and I go hang out at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach and I say to you,</v>

974
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's that wave concentrated?</v>

975
00:45:56.791 --> 00:46:00.990
<v Speaker 1>At what point does that with wave live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at me and say it's a wave.</v>

976
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not concentrated at a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all along the shore.</v>

977
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 1>So as a classical physicists you to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good question,</v>

978
00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I asked you a good question,</v>

979
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.213
<v Speaker 1>like how fast is that wave front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving along this trajectory of </v>

980
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:19.134
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can give me an answer and it's </v>

981
00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:20.544
<v Speaker 1>definite.</v>

982
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you ask a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In classical mechanics,</v>

983
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.013
<v Speaker 1>you get definite answers when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics and you ask a good </v>

984
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:29.460
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

985
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 1>technically that means that the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>vector is an observable of the,</v>

986
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.060
<v Speaker 1>her mission operator representing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

987
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm funny.</v>

988
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get deterministic answers.</v>

989
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no probability involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

990
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So if I ask a good question in quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>

991
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I have the same property that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

992
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:48.763
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I ask a good question in classical </v>

993
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a definite answer.</v>

994
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:52.224
<v Speaker 1>There is no probability when I ask a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and quantum mechanics instead </v>

995
00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:59.450
<v Speaker 1>of like classical mechanics says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.770
<v Speaker 1>screw off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not answering that.</v>

997
00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:03.450
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad question.</v>

998
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.793
<v Speaker 1>Quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you really want to ask me a bad </v>

999
00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1000
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.453
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you maybe this answer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that answer and here's the </v>

1001
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:11.544
<v Speaker 1>probability distribution that I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually give you either of those two </v>

1002
00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:17.220
<v Speaker 1>answers and what's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll even kick it into the state that I,</v>

1003
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 1>that you asked about.</v>

1004
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.793
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask where is that wave </v>

1005
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:22.614
<v Speaker 1>concentrated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like let's say this is my coffee cup </v>

1006
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and I drop a little drop in the center </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

1007
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that creates a circular way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiates.</v>

1008
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.090
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does the wave concentrated?</v>

1009
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one second it hits the Coffee Mug.</v>

1010
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:35.884
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's a big coffee cup and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one second after that it's concentrated </v>

1011
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:39.694
<v Speaker 1>again in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that becomes a good question only </v>

1012
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 1>when the wave becomes really </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated in the center of the cup.</v>

1013
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that wave where a quantum wave,</v>

1014
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I could ask where is the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated and with equal probability,</v>

1015
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.393
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the wave will concentrate at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point along the circle that </v>

1016
00:47:58.811 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 1>represents the wave,</v>

1017
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would your answer be then?</v>

1018
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 1>What the point would be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll concentrate at one of these points</v>

1019
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:07.990
<v Speaker 1>around the circle at random,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with equal,</v>

1020
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.143
<v Speaker 1>with equal probability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suddenly the wave will concentrate </v>

1021
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:13.150
<v Speaker 1>randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

1022
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.043
<v Speaker 1>when it's a quantum question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is why quantum mechanics is so </v>

1023
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:17.223
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quantum physics are so confusing to </v>

1024
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 1>people because they hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hear that and they go,</v>

1025
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:21.484
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is confused when in my head like </v>

1026
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Jello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1027
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point of if I,</v>

1028
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:27.274
<v Speaker 1>if I have a wave and I slow it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can look at a wave and a coffee mug </v>

1029
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.460
<v Speaker 1>and I can see that if I ask where is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave concentrated,</v>

1030
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.823
<v Speaker 1>you would say it's concentrated at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>half an inch from the center of the cup </v>

1031
00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.691
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1032
00:48:38.691 --> 00:48:41.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what ring is it concentrated or what</v>

1033
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:44.740
<v Speaker 1>exact point that concentrated in exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1034
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.083
<v Speaker 1>but that wave in quantum mechanics which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not concentrated at an exact point </v>

1035
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>behaves differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I ask a bad question.</v>

1036
00:48:53.051 --> 00:48:53.884
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point that I'm trying to get across </v>

1037
00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:55.714
<v Speaker 1>is good questions have exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties in classical mechanics and </v>

1038
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:01.084
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no introduction to probability </v>

1039
00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:03.364
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weird question is why is quantum </v>

1040
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 1>mechanics answering bad questions?</v>

1041
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even weirder question is</v>

1042
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.320
<v Speaker 1>not just why is quantum mechanics in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent state of understanding?</v>

1043
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the problem that they </v>

1044
00:49:20.661 --> 00:49:21.494
<v Speaker 1>don't know enough yet and they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like explain what they do know and </v>

1045
00:49:25.101 --> 00:49:27.920
<v Speaker 1>what they can prove on paper and for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person like me,</v>

1046
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.833
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1047
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.350
<v Speaker 1>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1048
00:49:30.351 --> 00:49:31.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know probabilities.</v>

1049
00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:32.684
<v Speaker 1>We know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that and a person like me who </v>

1050
00:49:34.131 --> 00:49:36.920
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any studying and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes up.</v>

1051
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:38.660
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

1052
00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.613
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like let's say we were having a </v>

1053
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:41.444
<v Speaker 1>conversation about genetics and we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking only at the DNA and we didn't </v>

1054
00:49:44.241 --> 00:49:48.410
<v Speaker 1>see epigenetics in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>methylation patterns.</v>

1055
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:49.993
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd shove everything onto DNA and </v>

1056
00:49:52.041 --> 00:49:52.874
<v Speaker 1>maybe you had no concept of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and the model would work up </v>

1057
00:49:57.021 --> 00:49:59.750
<v Speaker 1>to a point would explain why you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>blue eyes or Brown eyes,</v>

1058
00:49:59.751 --> 00:50:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't explain all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

1059
00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And so now then you over overdeveloped </v>
<v Speaker 1>that model.</v>

1060
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:08.870
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really Einstein's intuition,</v>

1061
00:50:08.871 --> 00:50:11.710
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm Einstein,</v>

1062
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this is incomplete.</v>

1063
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And then when we finally get the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to say,</v>

1064
00:50:16.671 --> 00:50:17.504
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we used to think of it in </v>

1065
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:22.550
<v Speaker 1>those crazy terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to gauge theory,</v>

1066
00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.400
<v Speaker 1>gauge symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell was that?</v>

1067
00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:26.600
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1068
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 1>here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the craziest thing.</v>

1069
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a very confusing visual image </v>

1070
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.463
<v Speaker 1>of the fundamental unit that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate what gauge symmetry is all </v>

1071
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1072
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:39.734
<v Speaker 1>I had Jamie loaded up under the tab </v>
<v Speaker 1>called planet hop and this is going to </v>

1073
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.840
<v Speaker 1>hop pf a h,</v>
<v Speaker 1>o,</v>

1074
00:50:46.841 --> 00:50:47.674
<v Speaker 1>p,</v>
<v Speaker 1>f,</v>

1075
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.093
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I looking at you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or looking at the most important object </v>

1076
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:57.020
<v Speaker 1>in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that looks like,</v>

1077
00:50:57.021 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>some trippy screensaver on your laptop.</v>

1078
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Take another puff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend because it's worth it.</v>

1079
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:07.870
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're looking at is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle fiber bundle and it's in,</v>

1080
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>it is the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the continents.</v>

1081
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.453
<v Speaker 1>That's the cool part about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this is very confusing to </v>

1082
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's finite.</v>

1083
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.533
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we stay for an hour or two on this </v>

1084
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 1>and we actually answer all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

1085
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:25.964
<v Speaker 1>you will actually know what a principal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bundle is and you will know the </v>

1086
00:51:28.371 --> 00:51:29.204
<v Speaker 1>arena in which gauge theory exists for </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks at home that are just listening </v>

1087
00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:33.884
<v Speaker 1>and they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are these guys talking </v>

1088
00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the name of this video?</v>

1089
00:51:36.321 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Jamie video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a video.</v>

1090
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.913
<v Speaker 1>It's a small file on a page I typed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet hop and that was the first thing </v>

1091
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:46.490
<v Speaker 1>that showed up on math dot Toronto Dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edu.</v>

1092
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so extended thing.</v>

1093
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Planet h o p,</v>
<v Speaker 1>F for anybody wants to look at this.</v>

1094
00:51:52.851 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 1>If you're just listening and you have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea why I'm freaking out.</v>

1095
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.153
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was done by a friend of mine named </v>

1096
00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Drawer Barn Aton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually coded the same thing up.</v>

1097
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough.</v>

1098
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Didn't do a brilliant job of coloring </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1099
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.360
<v Speaker 1>It looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motorola.</v>

1100
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.793
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's you're looking at is a two </v>

1101
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:16.094
<v Speaker 1>dimensional sphere that is the surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the earth where an extra circle is </v>

1102
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:26.780
<v Speaker 1>included at every point on the surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that sphere,</v>

1103
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>which you're now visualizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that extra circle,</v>

1104
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:37.130
<v Speaker 1>which would be called the fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1105
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.760
<v Speaker 1>when you take the totality of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those circles together,</v>

1106
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:42.800
<v Speaker 1>one for each point on the surface of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere,</v>

1107
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.593
<v Speaker 1>they create something called a three </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere that is all the points that are </v>

1108
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:52.370
<v Speaker 1>one unit of distance away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin in four dimensional space.</v>

1109
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:53.773
<v Speaker 1>So that three dimensional sphere is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>analog of a two dimensional spheres </v>

1110
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 1>sitting in three dimensional space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about a caramel apple.</v>

1111
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:04.850
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever made caramel apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a disk of Carmel and you wrap it</v>

1112
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 1>around the sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the apical surface,</v>

1113
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the three dimensional version</v>

1114
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:16.820
<v Speaker 1>of Carmel wrapped around the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional,</v>

1115
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 1>a sphere sitting in four dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

1116
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you understand any of this,</v>

1117
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>

1118
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally trippy,</v>

1119
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're not going to get it </v>

1120
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 1>completely during this session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1121
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.573
<v Speaker 1>I think I lacked the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so if that we lack the </v>

1122
00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:36.354
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is you are finding </v>

1123
00:53:37.771 --> 00:53:38.604
<v Speaker 1>out that one of your friends thinks this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the most important object in the </v>

1124
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 1>universe and you've never even heard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1125
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Much less know that there's one visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

1126
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 1>What's a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is this happening?</v>

1127
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does look fucking crazy.</v>

1128
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1129
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.353
<v Speaker 1>This is what was discovered in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies as the connection between </v>

1130
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:04.763
<v Speaker 1>mathematics and different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call differential geometry and </v>

1131
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 1>the discipline of particle theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two guys,</v>

1132
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Simons,</v>

1133
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.633
<v Speaker 1>the world now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's most successful hedge fund </v>

1134
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:17.004
<v Speaker 1>manager and cn Yang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who might arguably be the </v>

1135
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:20.664
<v Speaker 1>world's first or second greatest living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physicists had a lunch </v>

1136
00:54:24.121 --> 00:54:24.931
<v Speaker 1>seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

1137
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:26.820
<v Speaker 1>why don't we figure out how do we talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to each other?</v>

1138
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.493
<v Speaker 1>And what they found out is they both had</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a version of this picture and </v>

1139
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.020
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independently.</v>

1140
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So it was the Rosetta stone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unleashed a revolution.</v>

1141
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 1>So when Lawrence Krauss was talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about gauge theory,</v>

1142
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:43.343
<v Speaker 1>he was saying things about chessboards </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you color it white and you color it </v>

1143
00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:46.914
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

1144
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.843
<v Speaker 1>Super confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather your people be confused </v>

1145
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:52.643
<v Speaker 1>about an actual example of the object on</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we do gauge theory that you can </v>

1146
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:57.144
<v Speaker 1>visually see [inaudible] right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I started to tell you what gauge </v>

1147
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:06.370
<v Speaker 1>theory is pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the.</v>

1148
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:07.283
<v Speaker 1>Here's the description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never hear anyone say when you're </v>

1149
00:55:09.391 --> 00:55:10.224
<v Speaker 1>doing differential calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember </v>

1150
00:55:12.301 --> 00:55:13.134
<v Speaker 1>differential calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure out the slopes of </v>

1151
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:17.640
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instantaneous rise over the run.</v>

1152
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 1>So that always makes sense to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1153
00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I figured out how fast it's going up </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus how fast it's going across.</v>

1154
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 1>But a question arises which is where do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you measure the rise from?</v>

1155
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say,</v>

1156
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 1>what is the height of Mount Everest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1157
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:39.270
<v Speaker 1>We'll say 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1158
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.750
<v Speaker 1>5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1159
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1160
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.990
<v Speaker 1>let's get an internet connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1161
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.833
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it is?</v>

1162
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:50.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if I was to say it's </v>

1163
00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 1>$35,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that it was?</v>

1164
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Twenty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty nine.</v>

1165
00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.173
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two nine.</v>

1166
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.691
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

1167
00:55:57.691 --> 00:55:59.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest was the highest one.</v>

1168
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it k two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>K Two is second,</v>

1169
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:04.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it has ever the highest?</v>

1170
00:56:04.821 --> 00:56:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

1171
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.680
<v Speaker 1>so everest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29.</v>

1172
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Would you say 29.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty nine.</v>

1173
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:10.014
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two nine.</v>

1174
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Above what sea level.</v>

1175
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Mount Everest located the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Himalayas.</v>

1176
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:18.841
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1177
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:20.000
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1178
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.600
<v Speaker 1>there's no ocean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1179
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 1>So like we snuck its above sea level and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no ocean.</v>

1180
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 1>So we start from the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth.</v>

1181
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Will we have this structure called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joy,</v>

1182
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 1>which is the interpolation of sea level </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if sea level is.</v>

1183
00:56:33.521 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 1>If the earth was only ocean and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no tie in as if there's some sort of</v>

1184
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we snuck in the reference level.</v>

1185
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:40.263
<v Speaker 1>That's my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we teach these kids to repeat </v>

1186
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:43.623
<v Speaker 1>why it's 29,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and change above sea level and there's </v>

1187
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.293
<v Speaker 1>no C.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1188
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So that reference level is the magic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gauge theory,</v>

1189
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.453
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is that we measured the rise over </v>

1190
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:58.381
<v Speaker 1>the run based on a custom level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at a level that we all agree upon.</v>

1191
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:01.990
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that you and I are in some</v>

1192
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 1>country experiencing hyperinflation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1193
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm your boss and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1194
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I need a raise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1195
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you I would hire you for,</v>

1196
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:14.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1197
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 1>dinars a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

1198
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1199
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:21.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your salary is constant.</v>

1200
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I took the derivative of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've paid you $10,000</v>

1201
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 1>last month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1202
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:25.924
<v Speaker 1>this month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting the same amount </v>

1203
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.880
<v Speaker 1>derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal zero.</v>

1204
00:57:27.881 --> 00:57:28.714
<v Speaker 1>It's constant salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to come back at me in </v>

1205
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:33.940
<v Speaker 1>calculus and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1206
00:57:33.941 --> 00:57:34.774
<v Speaker 1>I don't like your notion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivative because what you're doing is </v>

1207
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you're measuring the absolute number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinars that you're paying me,</v>

1208
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.093
<v Speaker 1>but what I want to do is I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it and purchasing power because </v>

1209
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing money every month that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't increase my salary.</v>

1210
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:48.873
<v Speaker 1>So I now come up with a version of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculus in which Mike salary is not </v>

1211
00:57:53.501 --> 00:57:58.360
<v Speaker 1>constant because it's being measured </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to purchasing power rather than</v>

1212
00:57:58.361 --> 00:57:59.194
<v Speaker 1>absolute units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gauge there is that you're </v>

1213
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:07.621
<v Speaker 1>bringing in a reference level that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>the differentiation.</v>

1214
00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So you're measuring rise over run by </v>
<v Speaker 1>customizing the problem.</v>

1215
00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.353
<v Speaker 1>So these were two different applications</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the calculus that cheating employer </v>

1216
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go with constant dnrs.</v>

1217
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.920
<v Speaker 1>The gifted employees says not so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know gauge theory.</v>

1218
00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to use a custom reference level </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is purchasing power,</v>

1219
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:28.863
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like sneaking the geoint into </v>

1220
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Tibet to measure everest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my custom level.</v>

1221
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:34.990
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes sense to you.</v>

1222
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense right now.</v>

1223
00:58:37.841 --> 00:58:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say what he said.</v>

1224
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.430
<v Speaker 1>We would need a new reference of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

1225
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>You want to measure what the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation to have like a flat level.</v>

1226
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.083
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be really difficult for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to recall a day from now maybe we'd </v>

1227
00:58:55.590 --> 00:59:00.590
<v Speaker 1>know we'd might have recalled that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop up mushroom cap.</v>

1228
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.740
<v Speaker 1>See what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1229
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in reference to quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

1230
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Like how you would use gauge symmetry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1231
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:10.623
<v Speaker 1>but let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at some more cool stuff with </v>

1232
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.053
<v Speaker 1>the visual cortex because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can do visually should inform </v>

1233
00:59:16.031 --> 00:59:16.864
<v Speaker 1>what we can do linguistically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should push everything into the </v>

1234
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:21.500
<v Speaker 1>visual realm that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1235
00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.800
<v Speaker 1>do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1236
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 1>well I just showed you the hop </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibration,</v>

1237
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:25.603
<v Speaker 1>which is the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the only mature picture I </v>

1238
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:31.064
<v Speaker 1>can show you have a principal vibration </v>
<v Speaker 1>in geometry or physics that is honest </v>

1239
00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:37.183
<v Speaker 1>and has the full complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a certain kind of nodded </v>

1240
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.334
<v Speaker 1>newness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got something that we would call </v>

1241
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 1>curvature and it is visualized and so</v>

1242
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.500
<v Speaker 1>it would be better that we spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1243
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:51.363
<v Speaker 1>a day or two on this most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>object which we think reality is based </v>

1244
00:59:55.001 --> 00:59:58.540
<v Speaker 1>around and that you visually got </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with it.</v>

1245
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1246
01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>now tell me again what gauge symmetry </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1247
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And then instead of Lawrence talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this chessboard and the colors and</v>

1248
01:00:06.491 --> 01:00:07.960
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by analogy,</v>

1249
01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>you'd actually be seeing gauge theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>visually like I could program a computer</v>

1250
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>and have done so to show you visually </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a gauge theory is.</v>

1251
01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.243
<v Speaker 1>And that takes some time to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the trip he pictures </v>

1252
01:00:20.561 --> 01:00:21.394
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if let's bring up the escher </v>

1253
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:22.594
<v Speaker 1>staircase</v>

1254
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.653
<v Speaker 1>and Jamie has a nice wrinkle on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that instead of using MC escher </v>

1255
01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:29.224
<v Speaker 1>staircase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this animated guy who just </v>

1256
01:00:31.571 --> 01:00:33.830
<v Speaker 1>keeps going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1257
01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:34.923
<v Speaker 1>now what's going on with those stairs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the stairs are sort of an optical </v>

1258
01:00:38.771 --> 01:00:41.260
<v Speaker 1>illusion because obviously it can't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going down.</v>

1259
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>But then you build these systems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock,</v>

1260
01:00:43.361 --> 01:00:44.194
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scissors.</v>

1261
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>What's the best thing to throw in rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paper scissors?</v>

1262
01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you throw.</v>

1263
01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should be able to agree that rock</v>

1264
01:00:51.371 --> 01:00:52.204
<v Speaker 1>is better than scissors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock has better than says this paper's </v>

1265
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>better than rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1266
01:00:56.171 --> 01:00:57.004
<v Speaker 1>So you go around that thing and now the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point is that you get to like rock as </v>

1267
01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>much better than rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1268
01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.053
<v Speaker 1>And that seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that can concept would be what we </v>

1269
01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>would call Holland Omi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weird sentence.</v>

1270
01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Rock is better than rock because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>going around the loop.</v>

1271
01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.473
<v Speaker 1>Why rock has better than rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it well better than </v>

1272
01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>scissors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scissors is better than paper.</v>

1273
01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:16.803
<v Speaker 1>Paper's better than rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by transitivity rock is therefore </v>

1274
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>better than rock because you went around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loop and came back to rock.</v>

1275
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like Mna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Math.</v>

1276
01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:25.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1277
01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:26.883
<v Speaker 1>Or if like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're changing a currencies and you </v>

1278
01:01:29.831 --> 01:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>don't spend any of it because you keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing using your credit card,</v>

1279
01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.233
<v Speaker 1>by the time you come home you had more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money than when you left because the </v>

1280
01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>exchange rates did some things so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you changed into each currency,</v>

1281
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.680
<v Speaker 1>you somehow got richer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by saying rock is better than rock,</v>

1282
01:01:44.681 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you're denying the fact they're exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

1283
01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1284
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.403
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not addressing the linguistic </v>

1285
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>linguistic fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1286
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.313
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that this system here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those stairs in engaged theory would </v>

1287
01:01:58.721 --> 01:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>be these reference levels for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivative [inaudible].</v>

1288
01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:02.943
<v Speaker 1>And you can have situations where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference levels don't knit flatly </v>

1289
01:02:05.651 --> 01:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1290
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:09.663
<v Speaker 1>And so by virtue of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would say that the system has </v>

1291
01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>curvature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curvature.</v>

1292
01:02:13.691 --> 01:02:14.524
<v Speaker 1>Is the assuredness of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these better than transitive </v>

1293
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>statements what we're looking.</v>

1294
01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>

1295
01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.550
<v Speaker 2>for people who just listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at,</v>

1296
01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.370
<v Speaker 2>if you've never seen those essure </v>
<v Speaker 2>etches,</v>

1297
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:26.263
<v Speaker 2>those sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very strange because what there </v>

1298
01:02:27.521 --> 01:02:32.521
<v Speaker 2>are is a bunch of staircases that appear</v>
<v Speaker 2>to always be going downhill,</v>

1299
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>even if one of them is above the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1300
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange.</v>

1301
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:37.243
<v Speaker 2>And this one we're watching an animated </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy rolled down this staircase </v>

1302
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.890
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it really looks like somehow</v>

1303
01:02:42.891 --> 01:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must go up somewhere,</v>

1304
01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:45.883
<v Speaker 2>but you don't ever see it going up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also a factor of the illusion </v>

1305
01:02:49.371 --> 01:02:53.900
<v Speaker 2>of perspective and how it's drawn and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and playing games with lines.</v>

1306
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.033
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do this very weird </v>

1307
01:02:58.431 --> 01:02:59.264
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we didn't know about until the </v>

1308
01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>late fifties called the aronoff Boehm </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

1309
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>If you run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1310
01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1311
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.640
<v Speaker 1>an electric current through a wire </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insulated,</v>

1312
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1313
01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:15.943
<v Speaker 1>it appears not to have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic field outside of the </v>

1314
01:03:18.801 --> 01:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>installation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1315
01:03:20.211 --> 01:03:22.430
<v Speaker 1>if you do some sort of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>interference experiment,</v>

1316
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:23.563
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that there's current going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through because it affects the phage </v>

1317
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.280
<v Speaker 1>phase shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1318
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>of an electron orbiting that insulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic system.</v>

1319
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:37.640
<v Speaker 1>So nobody thought that that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen because they thought,</v>

1320
01:03:37.641 --> 01:03:38.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it insulator would keep.</v>

1321
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.803
<v Speaker 1>We thought the electromagnetic field is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what determines the shift in the </v>

1322
01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.444
<v Speaker 1>electronic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's insulated so there is no </v>

1323
01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:46.124
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic field to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turned out that it wasn't the </v>

1324
01:03:48.261 --> 01:03:49.094
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic field alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was some previous geometric concept </v>

1325
01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.020
<v Speaker 1>which is called the electromagnetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential that determine something about</v>

1326
01:03:57.021 --> 01:03:57.854
<v Speaker 1>the phase shift.</v>

1327
01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.670
<v Speaker 1>So this escher staircase in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetism,</v>

1328
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like the photons are the analog of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those steps.</v>

1329
01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.600
<v Speaker 1>They're partially would determine the </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivative operators,</v>

1330
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.870
<v Speaker 1>does reference levels and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our discussion of the,</v>

1331
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I paying you the right amount and a </v>

1332
01:04:14.331 --> 01:04:15.164
<v Speaker 1>hyper inflationary economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things you're trying to </v>

1333
01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:20.540
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's an optical illusion,</v>

1334
01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:23.330
<v Speaker 1>but that effect actually occurs in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

1335
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:25.490
<v Speaker 1>not as an optical illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1336
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this weirdness,</v>

1337
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:29.923
<v Speaker 1>I'm requires a fair amount in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>either study of math or learning </v>

1338
01:04:36.981 --> 01:04:37.814
<v Speaker 1>visualizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way to achieve it in my </v>

1339
01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.980
<v Speaker 1>experience with linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

1340
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Like all the stuff that gets said about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1341
01:04:46.431 --> 01:04:47.264
<v Speaker 1>the universe is expanding or let me tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what it gauge theory is and why </v>

1342
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1343
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

1344
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1345
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.910
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like what fineman said.</v>

1346
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>If you think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics,</v>

1347
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you don't know quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's some of that like there's,</v>

1348
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important things in the </v>

1349
01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:10.304
<v Speaker 1>world is this thing called a spinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the electrons and the protons </v>

1350
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.793
<v Speaker 1>correspond to things called spinners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the average person has no idea that </v>

1351
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>spinners exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more?</v>

1352
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Spinners have a property that when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell it to you linguistically won't make</v>

1353
01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

1354
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this with coffee.</v>

1355
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Hit me with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1356
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you sir.</v>

1357
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1358
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1359
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Hold Your Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sorry.</v>

1360
01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.173
<v Speaker 1>From the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the first challenge without </v>

1361
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:44.030
<v Speaker 1>spilling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1362
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I want you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without readjusting your grip on the</v>

1363
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>bottom of your cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to turn your cup 360 degrees.</v>

1364
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1365
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn your fingers.</v>

1366
01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:55.044
<v Speaker 1>Should not change on the cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn the cup 360 degrees without </v>

1367
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:04.621
<v Speaker 1>spilling it and try to take a sip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1368
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 1>That didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now without coming back,</v>

1369
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 1>how would you take a sip if I got it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way around that way?</v>

1370
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

1371
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu man would have to.</v>

1372
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.493
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1373
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I would have to help myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1374
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do it.</v>

1375
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:23.703
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ready?</v>

1376
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.293
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

1377
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go around the circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred and 60.</v>

1378
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.333
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm screwed if I don't bring </v>

1379
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it back underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1380
01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:36.184
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that system required 720 degrees of </v>

1381
01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>rotation unexpectedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just keep going.</v>

1382
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1383
01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.493
<v Speaker 1>Now the idea that there are objects that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't come back to themselves under 360 </v>

1384
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:50.974
<v Speaker 1>degrees of rotation but require seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 20 is probably something you've </v>

1385
01:06:53.201 --> 01:06:54.940
<v Speaker 1>never thought about before in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1386
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.433
<v Speaker 1>But without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have the poly exclusion </v>

1387
01:06:57.851 --> 01:06:58.684
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have the stability of </v>

1388
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:00.484
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this thing is called the Philippine </v>

1389
01:07:02.321 --> 01:07:03.250
<v Speaker 1>wind dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

1390
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:08.020
<v Speaker 1>do you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not very seductive,</v>

1391
01:07:08.021 --> 01:07:08.854
<v Speaker 1>Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like some very odd ethnic </v>

1392
01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:12.491
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>But like maybe you could do 11th planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

1394
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this spinner is one of the coolest,</v>

1395
01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:28.120
<v Speaker 1>most important objects anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was discovered to be important in</v>

1396
01:07:28.121 --> 01:07:32.340
<v Speaker 1>physics by a guy named Paul Dirac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1397
01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1398
01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:36.690
<v Speaker 1>So this 720 theory</v>

1399
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>is entirely responsible for the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we live in.</v>

1400
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:42.723
<v Speaker 1>This is so bizarre to don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in animation and nobody knows about </v>

1401
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1402
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Like unless you're hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>

1403
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.540
<v Speaker 1>they don't tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetism has to do with the fact</v>

1404
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:56.110
<v Speaker 1>that there's a secret circle at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in space and time that's invisible</v>

1405
01:07:56.111 --> 01:07:56.944
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't tell you that there's stuff </v>

1406
01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>that requires 720 degrees of rotation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just say mindblowing stuff about,</v>

1407
01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:03.403
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is happening in his 720 degrees </v>

1408
01:08:06.911 --> 01:08:07.744
<v Speaker 1>of rotation in the quantum world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an object that is requiring </v>

1409
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:17.131
<v Speaker 1>this just the way the cup arm system </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires 720 degrees of is this called a</v>

1410
01:08:17.991 --> 01:08:22.991
<v Speaker 1>spinner and that spinner is how we model</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electron,</v>

1411
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Neutrino corks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is spin oriel matter,</v>

1412
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1413
01:08:33.021 --> 01:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Long pause and like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

1414
01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>where does this fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our model of the universe?</v>

1415
01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the function of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it there?</v>

1416
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we know it's there?</v>

1417
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it's there because uh,</v>

1418
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:50.563
<v Speaker 1>when dereck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was this problem with like the </v>

1419
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:53.594
<v Speaker 1>Schrodinger equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schrodinger equation takes one </v>

1420
01:08:55.401 --> 01:08:56.234
<v Speaker 1>derivative in terms of the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time it takes to derivatives in the </v>

1421
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:01.304
<v Speaker 1>direction of all the spacial directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because Einstein told us that space </v>

1422
01:09:04.491 --> 01:09:08.330
<v Speaker 1>and time are woven together for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory to be relativistic,</v>

1423
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:09.403
<v Speaker 1>you need the same number of derivatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time as of space because space time </v>

1424
01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 1>is sort of one kind of semi unified </v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

1425
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.233
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you either have to boost the </v>

1426
01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:18.764
<v Speaker 1>number of derivatives of time up to two </v>
<v Speaker 1>to match the two derivatives and the </v>

1427
01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:23.714
<v Speaker 1>directions of space where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock the two direct derivatives in the </v>

1428
01:09:27.471 --> 01:09:28.304
<v Speaker 1>spatial directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to one derivative to get it to be </v>

1429
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.340
<v Speaker 1>equal.</v>

1430
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Now one direction gets you to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the client coordinate equation.</v>

1431
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.593
<v Speaker 1>What Dirac did is he took a square root </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the client Gordon equation to get </v>

1432
01:09:40.191 --> 01:09:41.024
<v Speaker 1>these spinners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had these numbers he didn't </v>

1433
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:46.730
<v Speaker 1>understand at first that he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get kicked into this world of spinners.</v>

1434
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:48.463
<v Speaker 1>He came up with a square root equation </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which eight times be thought to be </v>

1435
01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:52.034
<v Speaker 1>numbers was not equal to b times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was equal to the negative of b </v>

1436
01:09:54.981 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 1>times a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

1437
01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 1>what two numbers when you multiply them </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter in which order.</v>

1438
01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was matrices.</v>

1439
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 1>So this was one of the great insights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1440
01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.870
<v Speaker 1>rival Tine Stein in terms of the depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what it told us about the universe.</v>

1441
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Most of us haven't really heard of Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rock.</v>

1442
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.493
<v Speaker 1>We don't realize that he has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the three most important </v>

1443
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>equations in physics now in when you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>three most important,</v>

1444
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:19.184
<v Speaker 1>important in how it's applicable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday life or important and how it's </v>

1445
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:28.670
<v Speaker 1>given us an understanding and quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics or important.</v>

1446
01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:32.060
<v Speaker 1>How it's understand it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's understanding is is significant.</v>

1447
01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Quantum physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about bedrock reality like</v>

1448
01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you and I are having a conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a matrix fan and what we might</v>

1449
01:10:39.321 --> 01:10:40.840
<v Speaker 1>call the construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1450
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>What is the construct made have made?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way I do it is I think of it as a</v>

1451
01:10:45.381 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 1>newspaper story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's where and when did it happen?</v>

1452
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:52.370
<v Speaker 1>There was who and what was involved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's how and why.</v>

1453
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're in,</v>

1454
01:10:54.321 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 1>when is space and time clearly</v>

1455
01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.010
<v Speaker 1>the WHO and the what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1456
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.620
<v Speaker 1>let's say the who is the spinoff aerial </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1457
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like electrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protons,</v>

1458
01:11:04.421 --> 01:11:06.010
<v Speaker 1>neutrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corks,</v>

1459
01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.233
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that we're made of and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I are only able to see each </v>

1460
01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>other because we're passing photons back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth which are forced particles.</v>

1461
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:16.330
<v Speaker 1>They're not spinning royal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1462
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>they come back to themselves after 360 </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

1463
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't require 7:20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is sort of the,</v>

1464
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were going to go to a play,</v>

1465
01:11:25.891 --> 01:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you'd have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dramatic personnel of the play given</v>

1466
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 1>to you at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what this universe is,</v>

1467
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:37.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a story about space and time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherein,</v>

1468
01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.820
<v Speaker 1>when about what is in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1469
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:40.663
<v Speaker 1>like who are the players and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment are they using that's like </v>

1470
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Bozo firmagon's and then there's the how</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the why,</v>

1471
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>which is the equations and the Lagrand </v>
<v Speaker 1>genes that govern the rules of play.</v>

1472
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1473
01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:53.510
<v Speaker 1>if you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1474
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:57.720
<v Speaker 1>start to go to the beach and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a ball and a net and you think</v>

1475
01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 1>we're going to play volleyball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we actually sent me,</v>

1476
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:00.630
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1477
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:03.600
<v Speaker 1>we're going to play Seapak tuck grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like volleyball played with the</v>

1478
01:12:03.601 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 1>feet in a martial art style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is awesome.</v>

1479
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we showed a video on that recently.</v>

1480
01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Sleeves from Thailand or Bali there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really good at amazing.</v>

1481
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like ballet,</v>

1482
01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:16.470
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer and volleyball happening.</v>

1483
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 1>One thing we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should do this as a nation.</v>

1484
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:20.303
<v Speaker 1>That's a different set of rules for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball and a net in two teams that you </v>

1485
01:12:26.461 --> 01:12:28.380
<v Speaker 1>could have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way is volleyball and you could have</v>

1486
01:12:28.381 --> 01:12:30.980
<v Speaker 1>done it another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Seapak Tucker,</v>

1487
01:12:30.981 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 1>were you using your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your hands.</v>

1488
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 1>So those.</v>

1489
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the breakdown of what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics theory is.</v>

1490
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.633
<v Speaker 1>You got to tell me where and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to tell me what's in the game and </v>

1491
01:12:40.591 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you gotta tell me what the rules are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this place is.</v>

1492
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:45.203
<v Speaker 1>So theoretical physics is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting of all of these fields to </v>

1493
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:49.854
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because it speaks to us about our </v>

1494
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:53.190
<v Speaker 1>daily lives because it speaks to us </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1495
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:54.580
<v Speaker 1>well where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is,</v>

1496
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.433
<v Speaker 1>where is this thing taking place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that there's a small </v>

1497
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:05.631
<v Speaker 1>number of people like that are studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff that are.</v>

1498
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.280
<v Speaker 1>They're getting passed biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting past gravity,</v>

1499
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different variables that we're</v>

1500
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:17.934
<v Speaker 1>constantly dealing with and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting to the very things that </v>

1501
01:13:23.311 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>make everything and what is it under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiring lift,</v>

1502
01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>lift up the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in here?</v>

1503
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:32.063
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like getting into a computer down </v>

1504
01:13:32.821 --> 01:13:35.550
<v Speaker 1>to the zero and one logic gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1505
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that thing.</v>

1506
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:39.803
<v Speaker 1>We've got three or four equations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got three or four different kinds </v>

1507
01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:44.874
<v Speaker 1>of objects in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We seem to be and people are going to </v>

1508
01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>not like what I'm about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but screw them.</v>

1509
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:55.560
<v Speaker 1>We seem to be almost at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these equations are so beautiful.</v>

1510
01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:56.394
<v Speaker 1>They're so tight that it's almost most </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious because it feels like this </v>

1511
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 1>thing like a movie that ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>prematurely.</v>

1512
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:06.720
<v Speaker 1>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1513
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 1>when we found the Higgs particle at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>LHC,</v>

1514
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:18.420
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't anything left that needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to close to explain the system.</v>

1515
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>We know that there's dark matter out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that we don't understand.</v>

1516
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:23.734
<v Speaker 1>We know that there's dark energy out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that we don't understand because </v>

1517
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:26.344
<v Speaker 1>of astronomical observations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the stuff that we know about </v>

1518
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:31.323
<v Speaker 1>when you look at it and collided at high</v>
<v Speaker 1>energies and figure out what mutates </v>

1519
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:34.444
<v Speaker 1>into what.</v>

1520
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing missing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like.</v>

1521
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have got this odd thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everything got very,</v>

1522
01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 1>very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unified,</v>

1523
01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.653
<v Speaker 1>and it felt like we were going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two more giant unification and </v>

1524
01:14:49.541 --> 01:14:50.374
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing would be tied up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bow and right now we just don't have </v>

1525
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 1>anything that is needed to close the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1526
01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have radioactive carbon decay,</v>

1527
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see is that one of the neutrons</v>

1528
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.580
<v Speaker 1>flips into being a proton and it spits </v>
<v Speaker 1>out an electronic when it does that,</v>

1529
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1530
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:14.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like a trans nucleonics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shifts what it is.</v>

1531
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.263
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That electron doesn't carry off enough </v>

1532
01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:22.510
<v Speaker 1>energy to explain how energy would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conserved.</v>

1533
01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 1>There was something missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>

1534
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:25.504
<v Speaker 1>Wolfgang Pauli said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's a particle that's neutral </v>

1535
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:29.164
<v Speaker 1>so we can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't leave a track in a cloud </v>

1536
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 1>chamber.</v>

1537
01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>It won't have any effect that we can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetically,</v>

1538
01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.313
<v Speaker 1>but it's carrying away some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy because I'm not going to give up </v>

1539
01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:37.763
<v Speaker 1>on conservation of energy just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular process doesn't seem to </v>

1540
01:15:41.801 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 1>conserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough,</v>

1541
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 1>there was the sneaky particle that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiriting away,</v>

1542
01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:49.204
<v Speaker 1>some of the energy of the system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be seen because it didn't </v>

1543
01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:51.694
<v Speaker 1>interact electromagnetically and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't interact according to the strong </v>

1544
01:15:55.991 --> 01:15:56.824
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you could use to trap it </v>

1545
01:15:57.761 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>would be the weak force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weak force was so weak.</v>

1546
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That was very hard to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1547
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:02.824
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no new tree that I know have </v>

1548
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.124
<v Speaker 1>left to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no thing that's missing in our </v>

1549
01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 1>standard model and I'm just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied.</v>

1550
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's satisfied that the play is </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1551
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:15.623
<v Speaker 1>Why would the play be over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because we've discovered all the </v>

1552
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:19.054
<v Speaker 1>neutrinos?</v>

1553
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1554
01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.323
<v Speaker 1>it's that we had an easy job when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was stuff that was missing and then you </v>

1555
01:16:25.931 --> 01:16:26.764
<v Speaker 1>just hypothesize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's some invisible thing </v>

1556
01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:29.074
<v Speaker 1>that's carrying away some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go look for something that's hard </v>

1557
01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 1>to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they find it.</v>

1558
01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:34.960
<v Speaker 1>And so they'd find the higgs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they find the higgs,</v>

1559
01:16:34.961 --> 01:16:38.140
<v Speaker 1>they find the neutrinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find torque glue on plasma.</v>

1560
01:16:38.141 --> 01:16:38.974
<v Speaker 1>And a lot was going to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was going to say that they found </v>

1561
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.253
<v Speaker 1>like alternate generations of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you and I are made out of the first </v>

1562
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:46.414
<v Speaker 1>generation of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there could be alternate Joe Rogan </v>

1563
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.640
<v Speaker 1>made out of second generation or third </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

1564
01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:53.890
<v Speaker 1>We don't know of any generations beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>these two.</v>

1565
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1566
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.103
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

1567
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.863
<v Speaker 1>So like the electron has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a relative called them yuan that </v>

1568
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:08.530
<v Speaker 1>behaves exactly like the electronic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's heavier and the uptown,</v>

1569
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.423
<v Speaker 1>the up and quarks that make up protons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and neutrons have relatives called </v>

1570
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:12.974
<v Speaker 1>strange quirks and charmed corks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a second copy of Lego </v>

1571
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:19.190
<v Speaker 1>that has all the same properties as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first copy of Lego,</v>

1572
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 1>except it's at a different mass level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is denser,</v>

1573
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost identical copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody wanted this thing.</v>

1574
01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:31.330
<v Speaker 1>So the famous jokes there was this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a door robbie who was like a,</v>

1575
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an ethnic Jew in,</v>

1576
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:33.760
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1577
01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>

1578
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And when they found the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of matter,</v>

1579
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 1>he responded as if it was a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at a deli.</v>

1580
01:17:40.611 --> 01:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who ordered that?</v>

1581
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:42.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's,</v>

1582
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And physics who ordered that?</v>

1583
01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew there was a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

1584
01:17:46.881 --> 01:17:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they hit us over the head,</v>

1585
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a third one too.</v>

1586
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1587
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are these things coming from?</v>

1588
01:17:56.661 --> 01:17:57.494
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that you don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what a profound disconnect that </v>

1589
01:18:01.311 --> 01:18:03.230
<v Speaker 1>you're having all these physicists on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

1590
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And these are the basic secrets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1591
01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:07.640
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are rock solid,</v>

1592
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:09.830
<v Speaker 1>these aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't speculative multi-verse.</v>

1593
01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:13.520
<v Speaker 1>String theory will move Schrodinger's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat stuff,</v>

1594
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:14.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1595
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.003
<v Speaker 1>this is ground truth and we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and we don't know it because nobody </v>

1596
01:18:20.271 --> 01:18:22.130
<v Speaker 1>will show you a picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibration.</v>

1597
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.473
<v Speaker 1>Or there's a concept called the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how we think about symmetry </v>

1598
01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.613
<v Speaker 1>that no mathematician or physicist can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go a day without talking about groups </v>

1599
01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:32.234
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we act as if it doesn't need to be </v>

1600
01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:35.540
<v Speaker 1>taught in high school.</v>

1601
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Like it's too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll blow your mind.</v>

1602
01:18:38.601 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The groups even exists.</v>

1603
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:45.431
<v Speaker 1>So we built the professional version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject around objects that we don't</v>

1604
01:18:45.861 --> 01:18:50.450
<v Speaker 1>even tell you exist when you're studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>

1605
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:55.930
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the portal story </v>
<v Speaker 1>in childhood,</v>

1606
01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:57.373
<v Speaker 1>there's the story about either it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole or a looking glass or a </v>

1607
01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 1>wardrobe or platform nine and a half or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever these things are.</v>

1608
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of it,</v>

1609
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.193
<v Speaker 1>but how do I get from the world that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in to this new amazing world and even </v>

1610
01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:13.544
<v Speaker 1>find out that it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I think theoretical </v>

1611
01:19:15.081 --> 01:19:19.280
<v Speaker 1>physics has failed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't built a portal for most people</v>

1612
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:22.370
<v Speaker 1>to even understand what the issues are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the objects?</v>

1613
01:19:22.371 --> 01:19:23.204
<v Speaker 1>What is the game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How close are we to understanding what </v>

1614
01:19:25.371 --> 01:19:28.130
<v Speaker 1>existence itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think we're very,</v>

1615
01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:28.964
<v Speaker 1>very close.</v>

1616
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And the square root.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

1617
01:19:31.671 --> 01:19:32.504
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say before about Derok is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most profound object and </v>

1618
01:19:36.741 --> 01:19:40.070
<v Speaker 1>mathematics to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is is that when I ask you</v>

1619
01:19:40.071 --> 01:19:40.904
<v Speaker 1>what is the square root of negative one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a question that can be posed </v>

1620
01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>entirely within the familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real,</v>

1621
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the real numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're comfortable,</v>

1622
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:49.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you owe money,</v>

1623
01:19:49.761 --> 01:19:50.594
<v Speaker 1>you have money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need plus plus one and minus one </v>

1624
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:58.510
<v Speaker 1>square root and understand what w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what times itself equals my number.</v>

1625
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And when you say what's the square root </v>
<v Speaker 1>of negative one,</v>

1626
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:03.770
<v Speaker 1>there's no answer inside of the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

1627
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 1>but there is inside of this extension </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the complex numbers.</v>

1628
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:09.563
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like you're in flatland and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out is there </v>

1629
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:15.390
<v Speaker 1>anything beyond flatland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the great thing about the square root</v>

1630
01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 1>is it's a question you can ask in </v>
<v Speaker 1>flatland that gets you out of flatland</v>

1631
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 1>teases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You confuse the shit out of me.</v>

1632
01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood that part of it.</v>

1633
01:20:25.711 --> 01:20:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I understood that part.</v>

1634
01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:28.840
<v Speaker 1>The complex numbers thing got weird when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1635
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Algebra.</v>

1636
01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm taking like rotations of the</v>

1637
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Coffee Cup where my arm isn't involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1638
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I say okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a square root of that rotation?</v>

1639
01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>

1640
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.793
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now I put my arm into the system </v>

1641
01:20:42.241 --> 01:20:46.520
<v Speaker 1>and my arm plus Coffee Cup gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinners like,</v>

1642
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.453
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not even know that spinners were </v>

1643
01:20:48.781 --> 01:20:49.614
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that any object required </v>

1644
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:53.760
<v Speaker 1>720 degrees of rotation.</v>

1645
01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So the cup arm system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just exhibited it.</v>

1646
01:20:59.040 --> 01:20:59.873
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to learn Clifford </v>
<v Speaker 1>Algebra's or all of the extra jazz that </v>

1647
01:21:03.781 --> 01:21:05.610
<v Speaker 1>would get you to spinners </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically,</v>

1648
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:09.020
<v Speaker 1>but you need to figure out how do I </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover the war,</v>

1649
01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.893
<v Speaker 1>the hidden world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about this from the perspective </v>

1650
01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:13.134
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like Iowasca somebody takes Iowasca </v>

1651
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.333
<v Speaker 1>and they have no idea that their brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is capable of this alternate state or </v>

1652
01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:25.551
<v Speaker 1>Lsd or five Meo dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things are like panic rooms</v>

1653
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:29.910
<v Speaker 1>in the mind where if you lived in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>house for 20 years,</v>

1654
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.133
<v Speaker 1>you think you know your house and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day you pull an old musty book off </v>

1655
01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the shelf and suddenly the bookshelf </v>
<v Speaker 1>swings open,</v>

1656
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1657
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:38.663
<v Speaker 1>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a second home inside of my </v>

1658
01:21:40.501 --> 01:21:41.311
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1659
01:21:41.311 --> 01:21:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of what psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics are like square roots.</v>

1660
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that their portals,</v>

1661
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.413
<v Speaker 1>they can get you from the place that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know into a place that you never </v>

1662
01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.280
<v Speaker 1>imagined could exist.</v>

1663
01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.093
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the teaching of groups</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of these concepts in </v>

1664
01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.753
<v Speaker 3>highschool would facilitate a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of it from the general </v>

1665
01:22:05.801 --> 01:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>public and adulthood and the Gal and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

1666
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:12.520
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is the resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1667
01:22:12.521 --> 01:22:15.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just too complex or not applicable </v>
<v Speaker 3>to jobs,</v>

1668
01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:16.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the idea behind it is not </v>

1669
01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:19.114
<v Speaker 3>something that you use in everyday life </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that it's just too weird to think </v>

1670
01:22:21.551 --> 01:22:24.960
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that there's cousins to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the electron that are fat and</v>

1671
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:28.900
<v Speaker 1>a much worse than this bodybuilder </v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin to the.</v>

1672
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:34.010
<v Speaker 1>You want to bulk up and get made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have strange quirks.</v>

1673
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:37.330
<v Speaker 1>One of your cousins is made out of lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1674
01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much worse than this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that first of all,</v>

1675
01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:44.210
<v Speaker 1>people are terrified of just how smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>children are and the differences between</v>

1676
01:22:44.211 --> 01:22:45.044
<v Speaker 1>children have to be buried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some children are graded abstraction </v>

1677
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:50.683
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the kids were great at </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction or learning disabled </v>

1678
01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:55.310
<v Speaker 1>according to the teaching system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1679
01:22:55.311 --> 01:22:56.144
<v Speaker 1>I personally think that most learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>disabilities have a particular type are </v>

1680
01:22:58.941 --> 01:22:59.774
<v Speaker 1>actually teaching disability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know how to teach the </v>

1681
01:23:02.541 --> 01:23:07.541
<v Speaker 1>smartest kids and groups and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to lose some people because</v>

1682
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:12.040
<v Speaker 1>of the level of abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to get other people who</v>

1683
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.903
<v Speaker 1>have never been able to buy a base hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mathematics suddenly start over </v>

1684
01:23:16.411 --> 01:23:17.244
<v Speaker 1>performing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is that when you teach </v>

1685
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:20.164
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very disruptive to notions of the </v>

1686
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:25.510
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you</v>

1687
01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.720
<v Speaker 3>thought about what are the causes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different levels of perception?</v>

1688
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it education?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it genetics,</v>

1689
01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 3>is it environmental?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it some sort of a chemical balance of</v>

1690
01:23:38.301 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 3>the mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1691
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:40.054
<v Speaker 3>What do you think causes people to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>more perceptive to some of these </v>

1692
01:23:43.191 --> 01:23:44.024
<v Speaker 3>concepts?</v>

1693
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:45.363
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing I just showed you with the </v>

1694
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 1>planet earth in a way that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen it before.</v>

1695
01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I know of only two people who've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>created that image.</v>

1696
01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drawing Barden Aton is the other,</v>

1697
01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe there are many more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never heard of or met them.</v>

1698
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 1>The number of people first of all know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hop vibration is,</v>

1699
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:07.023
<v Speaker 1>I would guess is really deeply know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a few thousand people in the </v>

1700
01:24:10.301 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if none of those people are gifted at</v>

1701
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:14.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to visualize or none of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>care,</v>

1702
01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.213
<v Speaker 1>none of them program computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people who could present </v>

1703
01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:20.344
<v Speaker 1>that to the world is so small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a tiny priestly class that </v>

1704
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:29.641
<v Speaker 1>your odds of getting anyone figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make this understandable are very</v>

1705
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:31.684
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about a very small </v>

1706
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:34.834
<v Speaker 1>priesthood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of whom are too busy trying to do </v>

1707
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 1>new research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to care,</v>

1708
01:24:38.261 --> 01:24:39.010
<v Speaker 1>to communicate.</v>

1709
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Many of whom are not gifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicators.</v>

1710
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Many of us realize that we don't fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand these things.</v>

1711
01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:46.144
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you spinners mathematically </v>

1712
01:24:48.671 --> 01:24:49.504
<v Speaker 1>on a page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you asked me in my darkest </v>

1713
01:24:51.221 --> 01:24:52.054
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I believe that man really knows what </v>

1714
01:24:53.411 --> 01:24:54.790
<v Speaker 1>spinners are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1715
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:55.624
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this stuff that to me looks </v>

1716
01:24:57.131 --> 01:24:59.950
<v Speaker 1>like the monolith in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too freaky,</v>

1717
01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:02.740
<v Speaker 1>comes out of nowhere and it's at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core of reality.</v>

1718
01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really want to blow your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

1719
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.940
<v Speaker 1>look at a tiny number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny collection of these objects,</v>

1720
01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:15.020
<v Speaker 1>a principal fibrations spinners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally groups this eight,</v>

1721
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:18.250
<v Speaker 1>248 dimensional monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1722
01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:19.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1723
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a 248 dimensional set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cemeteries,</v>

1724
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.813
<v Speaker 1>which seems to live only to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetries of itself where everything </v>

1725
01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:34.891
<v Speaker 1>else seems to live to symmetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries something else and Nope,</v>

1726
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.740
<v Speaker 1>this might have to spark that joint back</v>
<v Speaker 1>up again.</v>

1727
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1728
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:42.783
<v Speaker 1>there's this thing called the tits Fred </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fall magic square after this guy </v>

1729
01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:48.580
<v Speaker 1>named Chuck teats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1730
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:51.650
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1731
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:56.670
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to generate these sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of symmetries of dimension.</v>

1732
01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Fifty to 78,</v>
<v Speaker 1>133 and 248.</v>

1733
01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.313
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like plot of Pi and a kid knows </v>

1734
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 1>of the mathematical world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just different.</v>

1735
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to relate to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else that we,</v>

1736
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.253
<v Speaker 1>that we know yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's so fascinating about </v>

1737
01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>them and these are discovered by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to figure out the nature</v>

1738
01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:21.704
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're discovered by people trying to </v>

1739
01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:23.804
<v Speaker 1>find more of these bizarre equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's who's discovering these in what's </v>

1740
01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:32.360
<v Speaker 1>the impetus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1741
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.253
<v Speaker 1>What is will you ask?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very natural questions like you've </v>

1742
01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:38.090
<v Speaker 1>probably seen you ever played dungeons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dragons as a kid?</v>

1743
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:39.103
<v Speaker 1>Luckily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1744
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you were beating people up,</v>

1745
01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.180
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

1746
01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I've seen one video anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had these die,</v>

1747
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Like the cube die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tetrahedral die.</v>

1749
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.280
<v Speaker 1>What does this shaming pattern beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>space time?</v>

1750
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:54.223
<v Speaker 1>This is my eight d surface parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Arch Nemesis when I was telling the </v>

1751
01:26:57.251 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 1>story last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sober October.</v>

1752
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garrett Lisi.</v>

1753
01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Bobby took me out into the jungle to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet this sort of differential geometric</v>

1754
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:08.280
<v Speaker 1>warlord who lives in the north of Maui </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the jungle farming.</v>

1755
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't remember this.</v>

1756
01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:27:11.061 --> 01:27:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You cut off my story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1758
01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Santa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>

1760
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are again.</v>

1761
01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Put that back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whoa,</v>

1762
01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:21.500
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1763
01:27:21.501 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is based on the eight dimensional.</v>

1764
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost certain it's gonna be based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the eight dimensional root system.</v>

1765
01:27:27.301 --> 01:27:28.134
<v Speaker 1>So inside of the 248 dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an eight dimensional donut </v>

1766
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:35.450
<v Speaker 1>called a tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an eight tourists,</v>

1767
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:39.710
<v Speaker 1>and it generates this pattern and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern in some sense in codes,</v>

1768
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:43.520
<v Speaker 1>the instructions for building the 248 </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional object.</v>

1769
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:44.683
<v Speaker 1>So somebody probably pushed an eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional thing into two dimensions </v>

1770
01:27:46.671 --> 01:27:50.980
<v Speaker 1>for your viewing pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does this accurate,</v>

1771
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 1>like when you're looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this image that we're seeing,</v>

1772
01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:54.680
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1773
01:27:54.681 --> 01:27:55.514
<v Speaker 1>I could make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can relate it to things that make </v>

1774
01:27:56.821 --> 01:27:58.100
<v Speaker 1>sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the idea is,</v>

1775
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:59.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I look at it the way I'd look at a </v>

1776
01:27:59.871 --> 01:28:01.220
<v Speaker 1>barcode and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1777
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:03.220
<v Speaker 1>tied unscented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1778
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1779
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but this is an accurate representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looking at it in two dimensions.</v>

1780
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1781
01:28:11.691 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to say is you don't even</v>

1782
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:17.720
<v Speaker 1>know to worry about this pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1783
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Because you've never heard that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things exist,</v>

1784
01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.740
<v Speaker 1>and this is like the closest that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to,</v>

1785
01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:25.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine mysticism where we have these </v>

1786
01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:29.000
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there are aliens,</v>

1787
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:30.493
<v Speaker 1>they know about ie eight because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight or the aliens one ea does the </v>

1788
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.273
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>

1789
01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1790
01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to this later.</v>

1791
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to interrupt your story </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1792
01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but I have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm,</v>

1793
01:28:44.141 --> 01:28:44.974
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to get at is this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>majesty and mystery of being a </v>

1794
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 1>mathematic mathematician or a physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These findings.</v>

1795
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.720
<v Speaker 1>So if I was to say about dungeons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons,</v>

1796
01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you're given these dice where the normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>day is always a cube,</v>

1797
01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:01.280
<v Speaker 1>but the platonic solids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have an octahedron tetrahedron,</v>

1798
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Dodecahedron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>icosahedron,</v>

1799
01:29:02.581 --> 01:29:06.630
<v Speaker 1>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an analog of those five platonic</v>

1800
01:29:06.631 --> 01:29:07.464
<v Speaker 1>solids in the next dimension up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they're called convicts </v>

1801
01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:11.484
<v Speaker 1>polytopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So each one of those objects has an </v>

1802
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:13.944
<v Speaker 1>analog one dimension up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was found out in the late 18 </v>

1803
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:17.964
<v Speaker 1>hundreds that there's a new platonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid and dimension for called the 24 </v>

1804
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:22.464
<v Speaker 1>says you want to bring up the 24 cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find an animated video of somebody </v>

1805
01:29:26.731 --> 01:29:27.564
<v Speaker 1>rotating this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like this is something that Plato </v>

1806
01:29:29.881 --> 01:29:30.714
<v Speaker 1>knew nothing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really understand what it's </v>

1807
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.880
<v Speaker 1>doing there in four dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are like communications from uh,</v>

1808
01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like when Jodie foster was in</v>

1809
01:29:42.041 --> 01:29:42.874
<v Speaker 1>the movie contact and they were getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them signals about how to make the time </v>

1810
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:47.950
<v Speaker 1>machine maybe or the portal machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:29:47.951 --> 01:29:52.150
<v Speaker 1>But this is on this stuff just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>come with an instruction manual.</v>

1812
01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:55.420
<v Speaker 1>So part of it is you can prove that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are there</v>

1813
01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.633
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know why they're there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them touch everything and some </v>

1814
01:30:01.551 --> 01:30:03.590
<v Speaker 1>of them have yet to touch almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1815
01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:05.173
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a communication from pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>design that there is so much beautiful </v>

1816
01:30:09.441 --> 01:30:13.580
<v Speaker 1>structure and so much grace in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that we're just,</v>

1817
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.340
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1818
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is everything,</v>

1819
01:30:19.201 --> 01:30:20.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the whole thing?</v>

1820
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:21.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

1821
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 1>if you accept three dimensional space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1822
01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 1>or let's say this glass right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you accept this glass,</v>

1823
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I understand that a circle can spin the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>

1824
01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.320
<v Speaker 1>The Circle circles worth of symmetries </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells me what to do to spend the last.</v>

1825
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:38.850
<v Speaker 1>That's not that confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1826
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:40.103
<v Speaker 1>Why is there something that the analog </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a circle where a circle I would call </v>

1827
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 1>one dimensional because it's got one </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of freedom.</v>

1828
01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:50.930
<v Speaker 1>This thing is 248 dimensions and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to live to symmetry.</v>

1829
01:30:51.551 --> 01:30:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Tries it in the jargon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would say it doesn't have a,</v>

1830
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:56.663
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a defining representation of lower </v>

1831
01:30:58.051 --> 01:30:58.884
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So normally you have something of low </v>

1832
01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:02.380
<v Speaker 1>dimension and you say what are its </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetries?</v>

1833
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Symmetries are of higher dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing seems like the first thing it</v>

1834
01:31:07.141 --> 01:31:11.250
<v Speaker 1>wants to symmetries as itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of self referential.</v>

1835
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of onanistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a zero point of creation.</v>

1836
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:22.410
<v Speaker 1>That's poetic language and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>groove on that after 11:00</v>

1837
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.900
<v Speaker 1>PM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't call it that right now.</v>

1838
01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I would say I was trying to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody up,</v>

1839
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.980
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero point of creation,</v>

1840
01:31:29.010 --> 01:31:30.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sexy word.</v>

1841
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:31.363
<v Speaker 1>It's a sexy way of describing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if we were saying the big bang </v>

1842
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:40.340
<v Speaker 1>existed and that means some point in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the universe,</v>

1843
01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:41.243
<v Speaker 1>it was this really tiny thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided for whatever reason something </v>

1844
01:31:45.841 --> 01:31:47.820
<v Speaker 1>happened and it became this enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1845
01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly enormous thing and it had.</v>

1846
01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:52.890
<v Speaker 1>There had to be a point where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

1847
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:53.783
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so what I would say is we can </v>

1848
01:31:56.191 --> 01:31:57.024
<v Speaker 1>competently take that story back to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we have to say we don't really </v>

1849
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 1>believe that we have any insight beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>

1850
01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 1>but people want to go there anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We absolutely know that it was tiny,</v>

1851
01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a smaller than the head of a pin.</v>

1852
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:13.653
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always uncomfortable saying the </v>

1853
01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.170
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1854
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:19.143
<v Speaker 1>you can say consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say a lot of stuff about very </v>

1855
01:32:21.731 --> 01:32:23.870
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small and it could.</v>

1856
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:25.240
<v Speaker 1>That could turn out to be wrong</v>

1857
01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.860
<v Speaker 2>in a possibly long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 billion years ago in our minds.</v>

1858
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.680
<v Speaker 2>As far as tough for a guy like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematics,</v>

1859
01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:36.500
<v Speaker 2>you see it on your numbers and paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all computes.</v>

1860
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:37.663
<v Speaker 2>You see the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen dollars billion is a number </v>

1861
01:32:39.141 --> 01:32:39.974
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But conceptually like for a dummy like </v>

1862
01:32:42.951 --> 01:32:45.020
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 billion is like if I really,</v>

1863
01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:45.913
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I do I really have an accurate </v>

1864
01:32:48.351 --> 01:32:49.870
<v Speaker 2>understanding what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 billion but,</v>

1865
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:53.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's uneven Weinberg doesn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>$14 million either.</v>

1866
01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1867
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:58.340
<v Speaker 2>100 yards is 100 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 yards.</v>

1868
01:32:58.341 --> 01:32:59.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too far to shoot a bow.</v>

1869
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you got to get a little closer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1870
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.430
<v Speaker 2>So you have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some kind of an intuition pump.</v>

1871
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:07.850
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rational distance that you see on</v>

1873
01:33:07.851 --> 01:33:10.430
<v Speaker 2>a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred yards is a long distance.</v>

1874
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:11.870
<v Speaker 2>A mile gets a little weird.</v>

1875
01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Like is that a mile away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far is that?</v>

1876
01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's six miles away.</v>

1877
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was that far.</v>

1878
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

1879
01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:20.000
<v Speaker 2>there's weirdness in distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1880
01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.740
<v Speaker 2>But when you get to a hundred and 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million miles,</v>

1881
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give up,</v>

1882
01:33:26.781 --> 01:33:28.450
<v Speaker 2>but you get to 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fatigued,</v>

1883
01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:32.000
<v Speaker 2>get fatigued by that stuff that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get energized.</v>

1884
01:33:32.001 --> 01:33:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1885
01:33:33.231 --> 01:33:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea how long ago that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>humbling,</v>

1886
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.883
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's the concept of </v>

1887
01:33:38.241 --> 01:33:39.074
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is one of the things that </v>

1888
01:33:40.821 --> 01:33:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Krauss said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it was Sean Carroll that said,</v>

1889
01:33:43.581 --> 01:33:48.581
<v Speaker 2>it's really not that we know that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see 14 billion years ago,</v>

1890
01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:49.883
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just as far back as we're </v>

1891
01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:55.610
<v Speaker 2>capable of seeing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if we did go further,</v>

1892
01:33:55.611 --> 01:34:00.611
<v Speaker 2>the light is actually moving slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you wouldn't be able to see it.</v>

1893
01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1894
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.153
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this thing about what the </v>

1895
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 1>spacetime metric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of how things are,</v>

1896
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:11.520
<v Speaker 1>feel like they're moving apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1897
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:12.423
<v Speaker 1>Einstein said four degrees of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus rulers and protractors equal space </v>

1898
01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:19.630
<v Speaker 1>spacetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1899
01:34:19.631 --> 01:34:23.080
<v Speaker 1>So a spacetime metric is a collection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rulers and protractors.</v>

1900
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:24.423
<v Speaker 1>So I can do length and angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including lengthen the time direction </v>

1901
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.180
<v Speaker 1>and that generates a derivative </v>
<v Speaker 1>operator,</v>

1902
01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:32.014
<v Speaker 1>which we talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rise over run relative to </v>

1903
01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:35.464
<v Speaker 1>accustom reference level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The customer reference levels generate </v>

1904
01:34:38.921 --> 01:34:39.754
<v Speaker 1>the staircase that we did and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>generates the curvature tensor which </v>

1905
01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:44.704
<v Speaker 1>generates gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strangely with all of this kind of </v>

1906
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:50.110
<v Speaker 1>like woo woo stuff that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1907
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.393
<v Speaker 1>we just came to a much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of what theoretical physics </v>

1908
01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:57.470
<v Speaker 1>actually looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's four degrees of freedom,</v>

1909
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>plus we're losing</v>

1910
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.940
<v Speaker 2>protractors gives you derivative </v>
<v Speaker 2>operators with customer reference level.</v>

1911
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:03.890
<v Speaker 2>The customer reference levels don't knit</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1912
01:35:03.891 --> 01:35:04.724
<v Speaker 2>That leads to an escher staircase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The degree of this is the curvature </v>

1913
01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:09.800
<v Speaker 2>tensor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The curvature generates the gravity,</v>

1914
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 2>which is what's keeping you and I in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>chair.</v>

1915
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're understood.</v>

1916
01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>You're explaining this in a way that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope that someone can understand.</v>

1917
01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:19.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid,</v>

1918
01:35:19.450 --> 01:35:22.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're explaining it very well.</v>

1919
01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:27.450
<v Speaker 2>The problem is for someone like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lack the tools to put there.</v>

1920
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't have enough open slots for these</v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts.</v>

1921
01:35:32.511 --> 01:35:33.344
<v Speaker 2>So it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you were explaining to me </v>

1922
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.660
<v Speaker 2>complex arguments in French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't speak French,</v>

1923
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:40.090
<v Speaker 2>so you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1924
01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:43.070
<v Speaker 2>bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means this and then you're explaining</v>

1925
01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:45.110
<v Speaker 2>all these other words and then you throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all together.</v>

1926
01:35:45.111 --> 01:35:45.831
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1927
01:35:45.831 --> 01:35:46.664
<v Speaker 2>And then it's cultural references and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to deal with the fact that </v>

1928
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:49.363
<v Speaker 2>there's some historical precedent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain types of behavior that I hadn't </v>

1929
01:35:51.891 --> 01:35:52.724
<v Speaker 2>taken into consideration because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>French people that have lived in this </v>

1930
01:35:54.831 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1931
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1932
01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:57.074
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1933
01:35:57.230 --> 01:35:58.950
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing compared to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to.</v>

1934
01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's drop some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1935
01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.090
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you do this thing about like,</v>

1936
01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.040
<v Speaker 2>well for meathead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like me,</v>

1937
01:36:04.150 --> 01:36:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely a meat head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

1938
01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know me better than you know me.</v>

1939
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:09.253
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're also less honest than you </v>

1940
01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:12.590
<v Speaker 2>think on this particular topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of your chart that,</v>

1941
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we hang out,</v>

1942
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:17.450
<v Speaker 2>we hang out usually in a comedy club or </v>
<v Speaker 2>at somebody's house,</v>

1943
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:20.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't say,</v>

1944
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.133
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to take the afternoon off </v>

1945
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 2>and we're actually going to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical physics.</v>

1946
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1947
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>So when I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did stand up for the first time,</v>

1948
01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:30.450
<v Speaker 2>as I told you in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there.</v>

1949
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was insane.</v>

1950
01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.320
<v Speaker 2>You try and explain fucking corks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1952
01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:42.380
<v Speaker 2>It'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be some real humor in that.</v>

1953
01:36:42.381 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 2>If you could boil it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three quirks.</v>

1954
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Go into a nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1955
01:36:45.321 --> 01:36:47.070
<v Speaker 2>There's like a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1956
01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1957
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the who was the guy who did the.</v>

1958
01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Some guy was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was praying,</v>

1959
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Cowen was doing quantum jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was he saying?</v>

1960
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

1961
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:57.703
<v Speaker 2>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a bunch of words that he did </v>

1962
01:36:58.641 --> 01:36:59.474
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly and it kind of hung </v>

1963
01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:00.711
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1964
01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:01.520
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1965
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like Brian.</v>

1966
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he reads a lot,</v>

1967
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's a clever boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>

1968
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.100
<v Speaker 2>when I had to do my 10 minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Standup,</v>

1969
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:12.680
<v Speaker 2>man is that craft?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's deep.</v>

1970
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:13.603
<v Speaker 2>It's hard because you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just like telling jokes at a </v>

1971
01:37:15.471 --> 01:37:16.970
<v Speaker 2>party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really.</v>

1972
01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.073
<v Speaker 2>You have to measure the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audiences laugh comes whether you're </v>

1973
01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:22.050
<v Speaker 2>taking them along or you going to divert</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1974
01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.350
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things that I never thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about before.</v>

1975
01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.353
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how you feel when you talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the hop thing that it's a part of </v>

1976
01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:29.834
<v Speaker 2>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most important things </v>

1977
01:37:31.611 --> 01:37:35.210
<v Speaker 2>and yet very few people know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a thousand people understanding on</v>

1978
01:37:35.211 --> 01:37:36.044
<v Speaker 2>the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's odd is that number is probably </v>

1979
01:37:39.351 --> 01:37:40.184
<v Speaker 2>identical to the number of legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional standup comedians in the </v>

1980
01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:45.260
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when I say legitimate,</v>

1981
01:37:45.261 --> 01:37:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone who can craft a new hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>every two years.</v>

1982
01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:51.260
<v Speaker 2>It does netflix specials who headlines </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the country.</v>

1983
01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.520
<v Speaker 2>It's small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1984
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:54.700
<v Speaker 2>traveled all over the world and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>

1985
01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 2>It's an small number</v>

1986
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.770
<v Speaker 3>of humans.</v>

1987
01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:57.603
<v Speaker 1>Not only that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is that the number of people </v>

1988
01:37:59.411 --> 01:38:01.440
<v Speaker 1>that you think are at the very top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that craft,</v>

1989
01:38:01.441 --> 01:38:04.720
<v Speaker 1>like when I really think about who </v>
<v Speaker 1>really knows theoretical physics,</v>

1990
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:07.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tiny.</v>

1991
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's smaller than 50.</v>

1992
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1993
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Guys that I would</v>

1994
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.990
<v Speaker 3>pay to see live or women that are paid </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see live,</v>

1995
01:38:13.991 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 3>it's less than</v>

1996
01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:15.610
<v Speaker 1>50th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 50.</v>

1997
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.903
<v Speaker 1>And so part of our problem is that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stuff that humanity is developed </v>

1998
01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:23.483
<v Speaker 1>is often resident and a tiny number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds and I feel very vulnerable about </v>

1999
01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:29.004
<v Speaker 1>the theoretical physics has been faking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's in a healthy state for a long </v>

2000
01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:34.104
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are so vulnerable on the doorstep of </v>

2001
01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:39.120
<v Speaker 1>actually cracking this puzzle in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

2002
01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:40.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2003
01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:44.230
<v Speaker 3>that's where our comparisons in because </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much anybody could do stand up if</v>

2004
01:38:44.231 --> 01:38:45.730
<v Speaker 3>you put enough time to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're silly,</v>

2005
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:50.410
<v Speaker 3>if you figured out the craft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but would you guys are doing is not just</v>

2006
01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.380
<v Speaker 3>really rare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the,</v>

2007
01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.633
<v Speaker 3>the barrier for entry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the cost of entry is exceptionally </v>

2008
01:38:57.641 --> 01:38:58.474
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to spend an inordinate </v>

2009
01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:01.834
<v Speaker 3>amount of time studying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding this stuff just to get to </v>

2010
01:39:05.471 --> 01:39:08.380
<v Speaker 3>a base level of what you've been able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain.</v>

2011
01:39:08.650 --> 01:39:09.483
<v Speaker 3>You've been explained like some really </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult concepts to the lay person </v>

2012
01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.553
<v Speaker 3>that must've taken you fucking eons to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn and understand all your study of </v>

2013
01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:23.410
<v Speaker 3>mathematics and of geometry and have all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2014
01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.420
<v Speaker 3>But I'm an imposter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>

2015
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:27.820
<v Speaker 3>While I'm not a physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2016
01:39:27.821 --> 01:39:30.460
<v Speaker 3>But you understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe don't practice physics.</v>

2017
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.631
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2018
01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.480
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>

2019
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2020
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.760
<v Speaker 1>it's something more audacious than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

2021
01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see a,</v>

2022
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 10,000</v>

2023
01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:43.020
<v Speaker 1>hours only sign a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2024
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 1>only those who've done their 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours can come in.</v>

2025
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:48.890
<v Speaker 1>My middle finger goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2026
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's not 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours or if it is 10,000</v>

2027
01:39:51.931 --> 01:39:52.764
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to get 80 percent of the </v>

2028
01:39:54.301 --> 01:39:56.880
<v Speaker 1>juice in that orange with like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the effort.</v>

2029
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours thing to me is a,</v>

2030
01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's cute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't factor in for phenoms.</v>

2031
01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:07.373
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

2032
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that come into </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2033
01:40:10.191 --> 01:40:11.024
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some natural abilities that are </v>

2034
01:40:13.371 --> 01:40:14.450
<v Speaker 3>pretty undeniable.</v>

2035
01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird equation.</v>

2037
01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:21.913
<v Speaker 1>But take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take something very simple like the </v>

2038
01:40:23.451 --> 01:40:24.610
<v Speaker 1>harmonica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:40:25.670 --> 01:40:26.503
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know that that sweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>blues sound on a harmonica comes from </v>

2040
01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:31.640
<v Speaker 1>not using it the way the manufacturer </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2041
01:40:31.641 --> 01:40:32.474
<v Speaker 1>which is called straight harp and using </v>
<v Speaker 1>it instead the way African Americans </v>

2042
01:40:36.651 --> 01:40:37.484
<v Speaker 1>figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is it's much cooler to base it </v>

2043
01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:43.670
<v Speaker 1>around a hole that nobody was expecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to draw rather than for blow.</v>

2044
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:49.220
<v Speaker 1>And that gives you a seventh chord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like sweet blues music.</v>

2045
01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:51.640
<v Speaker 1>If you start giving us some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2046
01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how will work.</v>

2047
01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:10.681
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

2048
01:41:10.681 --> 01:41:11.490
<v Speaker 2>You got to move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2049
01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:13.560
<v Speaker 2>So what's the traditional way of using </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2050
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.453

2056
01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Who knew when you get one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things as a party favor as a kid there's</v>

2057
01:41:36.450 --> 01:41:37.440
<v Speaker 2>somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>don't do that thing where you put your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth over it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll sign it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2060
01:41:42.090 --> 01:41:43.460
<v Speaker 2>But who knew that that's the coolest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

2061
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:44.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that there's something </v>

2062
01:41:45.421 --> 01:41:46.254
<v Speaker 2>called tongue blocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something called cross harp and </v>

2063
01:41:48.211 --> 01:41:49.044
<v Speaker 2>there's something called the one four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five progression with a scale that no </v>

2064
01:41:51.090 --> 01:41:54.300
<v Speaker 2>music teacher ever taught you in grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and piano.</v>

2065
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:56.220
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's four secrets</v>

2066
01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:00.670
<v Speaker 2>and now suddenly the world opens up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2067
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 2>when I opened for Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin invited me and they said,</v>

2068
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:09.310
<v Speaker 2>why don't you play a minute worth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>harmonica at the Masonic Theater?</v>

2069
01:42:09.311 --> 01:42:10.660
<v Speaker 2>So for 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2070
01:42:10.661 --> 01:42:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I became Dave Rubin's talking Harmonica </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monkey.</v>

2071
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So I opened for Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2072
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:16.893
<v Speaker 2>rule number zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is too short not to play the </v>

2073
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:19.114
<v Speaker 2>harmonica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should learn to play the </v>

2074
01:42:20.441 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 2>harmonica or know why they're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2075
01:42:22.481 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 2>There's this great thing in the cal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Berkeley fight song will win the game or</v>

2076
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:26.614
<v Speaker 2>no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why if you don't play the </v>

2077
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:31.000
<v Speaker 2>harmonica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so nice.</v>

2078
01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 2>It's so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So few people do it.</v>

2079
01:42:32.801 --> 01:42:34.750
<v Speaker 2>They're so small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number of secrets.</v>

2080
01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:38.320
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a reason because I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed myself.</v>

2081
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get housing,</v>

2082
01:42:39.581 --> 01:42:41.620
<v Speaker 2>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can meet people anywhere in the world.</v>

2083
01:42:41.621 --> 01:42:42.454
<v Speaker 2>All I have to do is carry around a piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of plastic with some metal on it or you </v>

2084

<v Speaker 2>can be annoying like a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like turn that fucking guy off.</v>

2085
01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:49.503
<v Speaker 2>Why is he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is he playing that Goddamn </v>

2086
01:42:50.650 --> 01:42:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Harmonica?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that.</v>

2087
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Put it back in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have your next champion.</v>

2088
01:42:53.730 --> 01:42:55.720

<v Speaker 2>My life.</v>

2090
01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's worse?</v>

2091
01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:01.683
<v Speaker 2>A harmonica or a guy brings a guitar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>start singing folk songs at a party on </v>

2092
01:43:04.661 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 2>the animal house effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2093
01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat him over the head with a guitar.</v>

2094
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:10.570
<v Speaker 2>You can shred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be fine.</v>

2095
01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.433
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were looking to hear someone </v>

<v Speaker 2>tread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that.</v>

2097
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:14.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these things are like options of </v>

2098
01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:19.470
<v Speaker 2>financial apps and you can exercise them</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you cannot exercise.</v>

2099
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.353
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an equal number of things </v>

2100
01:43:22.361 --> 01:43:24.640
<v Speaker 2>that people would say that are like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harmonica.</v>

2101
01:43:24.930 --> 01:43:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Like you should be able to do slam </v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry.</v>

2102
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:29.343
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should be able to do slam </v>

2103
01:43:29.951 --> 01:43:31.630
<v Speaker 2>poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't do slam poetry,</v>

2104
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I can feed myself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wants to hear slam poetry.</v>

2107
01:43:39.170 --> 01:43:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just trying to beat me Joe.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like how many little things do you blow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what are that powerful in </v>

2115
01:44:05.541 --> 01:44:07.170
<v Speaker 3>terms of like the kind of music did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes.</v>

2116
01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird?</v>

2117
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:11.750
<v Speaker 3>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no like balls,</v>

2118
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always that.</v>

2119
01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:17.090
<v Speaker 3>It's always that little candy bar </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking thing like there's nothing,</v>

2123
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:26.833
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's two buzz and there's other </v>

2124
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:32.300

<v Speaker 3>churches that they sing songs about </v>

2165
01:46:18.991 --> 01:46:19.824
<v Speaker 3>Jesus the trip balls and sing songs </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Jesus and what's really weird </v>

2166
01:46:24.721 --> 01:46:29.100
<v Speaker 3>about dmt in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess you could say the same of of</v>

2167
01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.963
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mushrooms apparently when it </v>

2168
01:46:31.741 --> 01:46:32.970
<v Speaker 3>synthesizes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2169
01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:38.120
<v Speaker 3>it's real similar in chemical content to</v>
<v Speaker 3>what dimethyltryptamine is.</v>

2170
01:46:38.850 --> 01:46:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fuck this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's an n.</v>

2171
01:46:41.131 --> 01:46:41.964
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine is dimethyltryptamine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when it's synthesized by the </v>

2172
01:46:45.841 --> 01:46:46.674
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the body processes silicide than I </v>

2173
01:46:49.951 --> 01:46:53.180
<v Speaker 3>think it produces something called for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox for a lock.</v>

2174
01:46:53.190 --> 01:46:56.520
<v Speaker 3>CNN dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's real close.</v>

2175
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I might have fucked that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's so close that it's like</v>

2176
01:46:59.851 --> 01:47:00.910
<v Speaker 3>their cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2177
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.130
<v Speaker 3>so there's something about music in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things and one of the best ways to</v>

2178
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:05.964
<v Speaker 3>get out of a trip if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're really tripping balls with </v>

2179
01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the sing your way out of it.</v>

2180
01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:11.243
<v Speaker 3>You can sing your way out of a bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually control the trip with </v>

2181
01:47:14.131 --> 01:47:14.964
<v Speaker 3>good music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's really </v>

2182
01:47:17.911 --> 01:47:18.744
<v Speaker 3>constant with Dmt is these arrows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these shaman will sing and these egos </v>

2183
01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:26.213
<v Speaker 3>with symbols and like a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drum and these like really rhythmic </v>

2184
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:32.260
<v Speaker 3>singing it.</v>

2185
01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.193
<v Speaker 3>It makes the hallucination dance in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really obvious tangible way moves </v>

2186
01:47:38.821 --> 01:47:42.780
<v Speaker 3>around itself and it changes in guides </v>
<v Speaker 3>the trip.</v>

2187
01:47:42.930 --> 01:47:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hypothesis has been that it's sort of</v>

2188
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 3>some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2189
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of personally experienced.</v>

2190
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.433
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually tripped listening to this </v>

2191
01:47:53.821 --> 01:47:58.080
<v Speaker 3>song and it was like these geometric </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns,</v>

2192
01:47:58.081 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 3>these entities that seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

2193
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:02.460
<v Speaker 3>they were like moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy,</v>

2194
01:48:02.461 --> 01:48:06.420
<v Speaker 3>this is the Iowa scarecrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the shaman blowing tobacco,</v>

2195
01:48:06.421 --> 01:48:09.390
<v Speaker 3>this is part of the ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually below tobacco on you,</v>

2196
01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.010
<v Speaker 3>why you you do that?</v>

2197
01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:21.610
<v Speaker 3>So this guy was just this little rattle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and singing and sometimes there's actual</v>

2198
01:48:21.611 --> 01:48:22.444
<v Speaker 3>singing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just whistling but in their </v>

2199
01:48:25.511 --> 01:48:27.880
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this beautiful soft,</v>

2200
01:48:27.881 --> 01:48:32.290
<v Speaker 3>rhythmic sort of song and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations dance to this,</v>

2201
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:33.303
<v Speaker 3>to the sound of this music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're supposed to dance to it </v>

2202
01:48:35.591 --> 01:48:36.424
<v Speaker 3>like they're a part of like it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just that you're having music on top of </v>

2203
01:48:40.361 --> 01:48:42.670
<v Speaker 3>the psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that they merge,</v>

2204
01:48:42.730 --> 01:48:43.563
<v Speaker 3>they merge and the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience experience is a hundred </v>

2205
01:48:46.331 --> 01:48:47.164
<v Speaker 3>percent affected by this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just that there's chemicals </v>

2206
01:48:50.651 --> 01:48:54.550
<v Speaker 3>that are interacting with your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your doing something to by responding to</v>

2207
01:48:54.551 --> 01:48:55.384
<v Speaker 3>that music and then the music is doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something by enhancing the way your </v>

2208
01:48:58.391 --> 01:48:59.224
<v Speaker 3>perception of this experience is and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that is dancing together like they </v>

2209
01:49:02.201 --> 01:49:04.780
<v Speaker 3>belong together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating shit.</v>

2210
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:06.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean my hypothesis has been that the </v>

2211
01:49:08.681 --> 01:49:13.540
<v Speaker 3>music acts as a prosthesis to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lock you in because the experience is so</v>

2212
01:49:13.541 --> 01:49:14.374
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>

2213
01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2214
01:49:15.911 --> 01:49:20.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's always a little bit weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2215
01:49:20.230 --> 01:49:21.063
<v Speaker 3>try to imagine somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want a glass of scotch and a </v>

2216
01:49:23.351 --> 01:49:25.340
<v Speaker 3>shaman to go with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2217
01:49:26.050 --> 01:49:26.883
<v Speaker 3>You probably need one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know someone at a bar that's </v>

2218
01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.880
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to drink this,</v>

2219
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:31.743
<v Speaker 3>we're going to drink this good </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentions and no one's going to be </v>

2220
01:49:33.581 --> 01:49:36.100
<v Speaker 3>grabbing anybody's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's no one's going and said,</v>

2221
01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:39.130
<v Speaker 3>no one's getting rude here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There would be no wedgies,</v>

2222
01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'd be nothing.</v>

2223
01:49:40.781 --> 01:49:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Nothing rude will be said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will.</v>

2224
01:49:42.761 --> 01:49:43.594
<v Speaker 3>You will think for a good solid five </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds before any hasty moves like </v>

2225
01:49:47.231 --> 01:49:47.920
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

2226
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 3>let's</v>

2227
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:48.993
<v Speaker 2>understand that I let it get great </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit going to get great benefit from </v>

2228
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:55.370
<v Speaker 2>this in terms of our ability to be loose</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to be silly and to,</v>

2229
01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:57.480
<v Speaker 2>to enjoy each other's company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

2230
01:49:57.670 --> 01:49:58.503
<v Speaker 2>if a demon comes out during this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must address this demon personally </v>

2231
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:05.290
<v Speaker 2>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't pull the demon out and throw it at</v>

2232
01:50:05.291 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 2>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2233
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.040
<v Speaker 2>This is good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2234
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:10.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that drunks,</v>

2235
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:11.330
<v Speaker 2>the throne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dementia,</v>

2236
01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.193
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing where they figured out that </v>

2237
01:50:13.121 --> 01:50:13.954
<v Speaker 2>if you put a worm in the mescal stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a great marketing device </v>

2238
01:50:17.141 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 2>north of the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2239
01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Cause you just tell some stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we were going to open that.</v>

2240
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.110
<v Speaker 2>What that is is just think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing gimmick next and then.</v>

2241
01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And then what we do is we found our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tequila company and we only so exclusive</v>

2242
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:34.300
<v Speaker 2>that you can only buy it if you also </v>
<v Speaker 2>hire a charlotte for the event will make</v>

2243
01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 2>tons of money.</v>

2244
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:35.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if.</v>

2245
01:50:35.381 --> 01:50:37.930
<v Speaker 2>What if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worm actually was psychedelic.</v>

2246
01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:38.973
<v Speaker 2>Like what if there was a way we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetically engineer a worm to be </v>

2247
01:50:42.581 --> 01:50:43.414
<v Speaker 2>intensely psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the worm literally is made out of </v>

2248
01:50:45.611 --> 01:50:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca like we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we put a toad in the misco?</v>

2249
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.373
<v Speaker 2>Well don't they do weird shit like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a little take tomatoes and they'll </v>

2250
01:50:53.691 --> 01:50:57.340
<v Speaker 2>like use [inaudible] frog DNA in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomato to make it live longer.</v>

2251
01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.500
<v Speaker 2>But isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some weird shit.</v>

2252
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.880
<v Speaker 2>They're already dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool stuff.</v>

2253
01:51:00.881 --> 01:51:01.714
<v Speaker 2>Is the green fluorescent protein stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have glow in the dark rabbits </v>

2254
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 2>and he makes these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2255
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get some glow in the dark bunnies,</v>

2256
01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:09.273
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do that right there is </v>

2257
01:51:10.691 --> 01:51:11.530
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2258
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So you have Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have glow in the dark rabbits?</v>

2259
01:51:14.890 --> 01:51:15.723
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have the genetically modified </v>

2260
01:51:16.721 --> 01:51:21.721
<v Speaker 2>potato with frog genes to resist </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathogens while in the holy fuck.</v>

2261
01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:24.243
<v Speaker 2>So how weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>GM potato uses frog gene to resist </v>

2262
01:51:29.541 --> 01:51:30.610
<v Speaker 2>pathogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

2263
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:32.610
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we do.</v>

2264
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Can we do a GFP rabbits?</v>

2265
01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:36.803
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2266
01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:38.293
<v Speaker 2>So what were we on before this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about how we get to </v>

2267
01:51:40.031 --> 01:51:43.130
<v Speaker 2>rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tequila with a fraudulent.</v>

2268
01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:48.220
<v Speaker 2>So what if we engineer that little worm </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like a 100 percent dmt,</v>

2269
01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:50.133
<v Speaker 2>100 percent dsd where you get down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that worm and whoever chugs to the </v>

2270
01:51:53.271 --> 01:51:58.271
<v Speaker 2>bottom and choose on that warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just call you immediately transformed.</v>

2271
01:52:00.771 --> 01:52:04.190
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck am I watching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are these glowing rabbits.</v>

2272
01:52:04.191 --> 01:52:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so weird dude.</v>

2273
01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.840
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoverboards and archery stuff.</v>

2274
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:10.140
<v Speaker 2>We need rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who need.</v>

2275
01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Now here's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2276
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:14.540
<v Speaker 2>My kids have rabbits in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those rabbits,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They chase each other around this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken coop and when they get a hold of</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bunnies are fucking ruthless to each </v>

2290
01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:51.854
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These two little assholes just chase </v>

01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:56.660
<v Speaker 2>each other all day long and beat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of each other.</v>

2292
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:59.660
<v Speaker 2>That's all they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do commentary?</v>

2293
01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>

2294
01:53:01.581 --> 01:53:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Encourage their batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ballard,</v>

2295
01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:05.840
<v Speaker 2>comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is actually missing.</v>

2296
01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's what happened.</v>

2297
01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 2>We are chicken coop burnt down from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

2298
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 2>but the chicken survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them got scorched.</v>

2299
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.800
<v Speaker 2>They all got fucking PTSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2300
01:53:15.801 --> 01:53:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I go near them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're alive.</v>

2301
01:53:18.610 --> 01:53:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had a maneuver them and move them.</v>

2302
01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 2>But one bunnies missing found one bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One bunnies missing.</v>

2303
01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:26.570
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's better for the one bunny</v>
<v Speaker 2>that survived.</v>

2304
01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:27.713
<v Speaker 2>And the one bunny that probably got </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked by an eagle or some shit like </v>

2305
01:53:29.691 --> 01:53:31.730
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a wraps on you had a good life.</v>

2306
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:35.150
<v Speaker 2>He beat the shit out of your friend for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half solid.</v>

2307
01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:35.984
<v Speaker 2>Just kick each other's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking horrible that his ears are </v>

2308
01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 2>totally jacked up to hear the shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>

2309
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.470
<v Speaker 2>like an old bag to the depth that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed?</v>

2310
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2311
01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:46.163
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a bunny got out and it probably </v>

2312
01:53:47.631 --> 01:53:50.360
<v Speaker 2>ran away or who knows what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened at Coyote got it.</v>

2313
01:53:50.361 --> 01:53:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of hawks,</v>

2314
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:54.050
<v Speaker 2>lot of hawks in my neighborhood.</v>

2315
01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.720
<v Speaker 2>It's most likely a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:56.893
<v Speaker 2>But whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one little bunnies by himself </v>

2317
01:53:59.091 --> 01:54:00.980

<v Speaker 2>He's like the other asshole.</v>

2318
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.830
<v Speaker 2>They're both assholes to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like one good bunny.</v>

2319
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.080
<v Speaker 2>They just find each other and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2320
01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I imagined just that's all you do for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2321
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:10.243
<v Speaker 2>That's bunny life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to male buddies together and </v>

2324
01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:20.210
<v Speaker 2>one's always trying to get away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One's always trying to eat and the other</v>

2325
01:54:20.211 --> 01:54:22.250
<v Speaker 2>one jumped on him and start biting him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kicking him.</v>

2326
01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And the other one we'll do the same and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll rotate.</v>

2327
01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:25.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very funny.</v>

2328
01:54:25.161 --> 01:54:28.280
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last two Jews in Afghanistan,</v>

2329
01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.880

<v Speaker 2>both had to live in the synagogue.</v>

2330
01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:33.150
<v Speaker 2>That was all the head left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really only help somebody.</v>

2331
01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:34.093
<v Speaker 2>Somebody went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody went to go visit the last two </v>

2332
01:54:36.630 --> 01:54:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Jews in Afghanistan and said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you,</v>

2333
01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.120
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you guys friends?</v>

2334

2337
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the most Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation between the last two Jews,</v>

2338
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:55.100
<v Speaker 2>they can't get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like the two rabbits that</v>

2339
01:54:55.101 --> 01:54:56.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the others went away,</v>

2340

<v Speaker 2>and lonely and confused,</v>

2341
01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:00.850
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:55:05.181 --> 01:55:08.420

<v Speaker 2>the last guy,</v>

2346
01:55:09.710 --> 01:55:10.543
<v Speaker 2>someone talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's possible for you to get to </v>

2356
01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.093
<v Speaker 2>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to think that it's a country </v>

2357
01:55:32.331 --> 01:55:35.990
<v Speaker 2>with zero Jews like zero.</v>

<v Speaker 2>whole pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all stu.</v>

2365
01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2366
01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.153
<v Speaker 2>The Taliban actually really needed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish community because they wanted to </v>

2367
01:55:52.531 --> 01:55:53.364
<v Speaker 2>be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had great relations with </v>

2368
01:55:54.511 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan Jewish community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't say it was two guys,</v>

2369
01:55:57.930 --> 01:55:59.940
<v Speaker 2>two dudes that hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2370
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Very polarizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you've got to fix the girl.</v>

2375
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.134

<v Speaker 2>bunnies and they're all going to be </v>

2376
01:56:11.251 --> 01:56:12.300

<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2391
01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hostile Hyenas,</v>

2392
01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 2>hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas.</v>

2393
01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:05.334
<v Speaker 2>There's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been evidence of hyenas </v>

2394
01:57:08.671 --> 01:57:13.671
<v Speaker 2>attacking their sibling while it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the amniotic sack and theirs.</v>

2395
01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:15.353
<v Speaker 2>When they come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger one or the stronger one of </v>

2396
01:57:17.671 --> 01:57:21.800
<v Speaker 2>the whatever one's healthy will almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately started attacking it.</v>

2397
01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Sibling and try to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull up that if that's true,</v>

2398
01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to see.</v>

2399
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to this crazy rabbit hole about </v>

2400
01:57:30.331 --> 01:57:35.070
<v Speaker 2>hyenas recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a bizarre animal that is.</v>

2401
01:57:35.071 --> 01:57:37.340
<v Speaker 2>So this the false penis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:39.150
<v Speaker 2>The false penis is just one aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:57:39.151 --> 01:57:39.871
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

2404
01:57:39.871 --> 01:57:42.300
<v Speaker 2>About 90 percent of the women die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2405
01:57:42.301 --> 01:57:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obligate symbols,</v>

2406
01:57:43.730 --> 01:57:44.563
<v Speaker 2>similar size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a sibling almost always ends up </v>

2407
01:57:46.051 --> 01:57:46.884
<v Speaker 2>being killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fugitive siblicide means the suicide </v>

2408
01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:50.943
<v Speaker 2>facul Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a choice versus you've got to </v>

2409
01:57:53.491 --> 01:57:57.360
<v Speaker 2>do a tative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faculty tackled facultative syllabus.</v>

2410
01:57:57.361 --> 01:57:58.194
<v Speaker 2>Siblicide means a siblicide may or may </v>
<v Speaker 2>not occur based on environmental </v>

2411
01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:01.710
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2412
01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:05.490
<v Speaker 2>so it's sometimes will happen if there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough resources.</v>

2413
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:09.220
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the breeding cycle is retired,</v>

2414
01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:10.093
<v Speaker 2>so you either make it or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the danger of laying one egg and </v>

2415
01:58:13.591 --> 01:58:16.650
<v Speaker 2>having it not work out is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2416
01:58:16.651 --> 01:58:17.560
<v Speaker 2>this bird is fucking.</v>

2417
01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 2>This is brother up and it has to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of mom and dad because you want to</v>

2418
01:58:20.671 --> 01:58:23.310
<v Speaker 2>prove that you're worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is insane,</v>

2419
01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:24.173
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Mommy,</v>

2420
01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:25.710
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's beating it to death.</v>

2421
01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:27.630
<v Speaker 2>So this is because there's not enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

2422
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:30.120
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough food to do two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first one,</v>

2423
01:58:30.690 --> 01:58:34.290
<v Speaker 2>the second one is a spare and the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>one proves,</v>

2424
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:36.990
<v Speaker 2>proves that he's worthy by killing his </v>
<v Speaker 2>sibling.</v>

2425
01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:39.300
<v Speaker 2>The spare in front of the parents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2426
01:58:39.301 --> 01:58:40.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can invest in me.</v>

2427
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I got this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2428
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:45.790
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of bird is this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably Nazca or blue footed boobies is</v>

2429
01:58:45.791 --> 01:58:47.500
<v Speaker 2>my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>

2430
01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:49.120
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to watch.</v>

2431
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I said about biology.</v>

2432
01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Biology cares about your feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mom doesn't give a fuck about her.</v>

2433
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the mom the mom wants.</v>

2434
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom's excited.</v>

2435
01:58:58.001 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 2>This one's dying fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mom's like,</v>

2436
01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.060
<v Speaker 2>mom's excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2437
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 2>the older one knows what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's viable.</v>

2438
01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature is pretty brutal,</v>

2439
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 2>pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>

2440
01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:12.100
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre seeing this from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2441
01:59:12.101 --> 01:59:13.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see this thing slowly </v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

2442
01:59:13.511 --> 01:59:15.520
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre seeing it from birds.</v>

2443
01:59:15.521 --> 01:59:15.971
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2444
01:59:15.971 --> 01:59:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's even more ruthless the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>lions,</v>

2445
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:21.130
<v Speaker 2>hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas killing their siblings,</v>

2446
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:22.623
<v Speaker 2>that almost a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were saying it's pretty </v>

2447
01:59:24.191 --> 01:59:25.950
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is when the first one comes out and</v>

2448
01:59:25.951 --> 01:59:27.570
<v Speaker 2>they tried to kill a second one with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2449
01:59:27.571 --> 01:59:28.404
<v Speaker 2>this thing about lion female lions </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting excited by the murder of their </v>

2450
01:59:30.881 --> 01:59:32.480
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2451
01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.740
<v Speaker 2>so when the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the new mail takes over the pride,</v>

2452
01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:37.503
<v Speaker 2>his first order of business may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's stop wasting resources on the </v>

2453
01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:41.943
<v Speaker 2>previous daddy's a offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens through this same kind </v>

2454
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:47.824
<v Speaker 2>of thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hyena gets out and immediately </v>

2455
01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:50.793
<v Speaker 2>starts killing its sibling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fighting to the death right out </v>

2456
01:59:53.741 --> 01:59:54.574
<v Speaker 2>of the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this fucking mad battle as </v>

2457
01:59:56.681 --> 01:59:57.514
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2458
01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.180
<v Speaker 2>it's still got the sack on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to kill each other.</v>

2459
02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:06.480
<v Speaker 2>This is a particularly ruthless animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were.</v>

2460
02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:11.580
<v Speaker 2>There were saying that 60 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyenas die as a trying to get out of the</v>

2461
02:00:12.591 --> 02:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>tube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2462
02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.350
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

2463
02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent of women die.</v>

2464
02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Whether females rather die when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving birth,</v>

2465
02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:23.880
<v Speaker 2>but that's because of our crazy brain to</v>
<v Speaker 2>body ratio.</v>

2466
02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>They have no female hyenas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2467
02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:28.560
<v Speaker 2>giant Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2468
02:00:28.561 --> 02:00:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were talking about high </v>
<v Speaker 2>rates of human mentality.</v>

2469
02:00:32.370 --> 02:00:33.203
<v Speaker 2>Female Hyena die 20 percent of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're giving birth because the </v>

2470
02:00:36.601 --> 02:00:39.240
<v Speaker 2>baby doesn't come out right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have this crazy,</v>

2471
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you know they have a penis that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a vagina.</v>

2472
02:00:42.071 --> 02:00:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an enormous,</v>

2473
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.860
<v Speaker 2>huge and gorge clearest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's far bigger than the males.</v>

2474
02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:49.470
<v Speaker 2>They have to pull it back so the male </v>
<v Speaker 2>can copulate with them,</v>

2475
02:00:49.471 --> 02:00:53.010
<v Speaker 2>but then when they give birth he has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out of that Dick and they don't.</v>

2476
02:00:53.011 --> 02:00:55.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't always come out right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so system.</v>

2477
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:56.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google that because I might be wrong </v>

2478
02:00:58.501 --> 02:00:59.334
<v Speaker 2>about the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's some exorbitant number of </v>

2479
02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.810
<v Speaker 2>babies die and a huge number of women.</v>

2480
02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep saying women,</v>

2481
02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.890
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hyena is done.</v>

2482
02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:08.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I fuck up,</v>

2483
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:09.143
<v Speaker 2>but there are also weird and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're way bigger than the males and </v>

2484
02:01:11.641 --> 02:01:13.860
<v Speaker 2>that's the because the males won't let </v>
<v Speaker 2>the babies eat,</v>

2485
02:01:14.250 --> 02:01:17.430
<v Speaker 2>so this one of the things they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if somethings are scavengers,</v>

2486
02:01:17.431 --> 02:01:19.290
<v Speaker 2>the males are trying to push out </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything smaller.</v>

2487
02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>So because of that the females have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in and go fuck off.</v>

2488
02:01:22.531 --> 02:01:25.340
<v Speaker 2>The kid has to eat like even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>their kid that's cool.</v>

2489
02:01:25.650 --> 02:01:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Sixty percent suffocate on their way </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2490
02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Sixty percent of them die on the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2491
02:01:30.690 --> 02:01:31.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's 20 percent of the </v>

2492
02:01:32.791 --> 02:01:36.270
<v Speaker 2>females die during childbirth as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure.</v>

2493
02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking.</v>

2494
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 percent though.</v>

2495
02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Imagine 60 percent of all kids die on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way out and then the ones that don't</v>

2496
02:01:45.921 --> 02:01:46.940
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got two of them,</v>

2497
02:01:46.941 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>one of them kills the other one.</v>

2498
02:01:49.290 --> 02:01:50.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2499
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:54.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a matriarchal society and they give</v>
<v Speaker 2>birth through that fake penis.</v>

2500
02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2501
02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:59.480
<v Speaker 2>What is the purpose of the fake penis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does take peanuts is a dominate the</v>

2502
02:01:59.481 --> 02:02:01.460
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get on top of the band and they go,</v>

2503
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

2504
02:02:02.391 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got a big old strap on.</v>

2505
02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.970
<v Speaker 2>They pegged their men at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Male hyenas are cooks.</v>

2506
02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:10.070
<v Speaker 2>They all take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2507
02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:10.933
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where we're heading as a </v>

2508
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diameter.</v>

2509
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2510
02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Ouch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tight squeeze that.</v>

2511
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 2>That creates a high death rate for first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time mothers.</v>

2512
02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High death rate is and say here,</v>

2513
02:02:21.531 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 2>how many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's 20 percent.</v>

2514
02:02:23.710 --> 02:02:25.020
<v Speaker 2>You've ever seen the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2515
02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:28.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the full human cliteracy?</v>

2516
02:02:28.190 --> 02:02:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen one.</v>

2517
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2518
02:02:32.090 --> 02:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>not in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The full,</v>

2519
02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:35.130
<v Speaker 2>the full clitoral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2520
02:02:35.131 --> 02:02:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2521
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a biological.</v>

2522
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Can you pull up the internal clutters </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal clinic?</v>

2523
02:02:41.290 --> 02:02:42.123
<v Speaker 2>I think it was only discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it not allowed to be shown to </v>

2524
02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:45.320
<v Speaker 2>quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

2525
02:02:45.590 --> 02:02:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll cause trouble.</v>

2526
02:02:47.370 --> 02:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could pull it up and just don't show</v>

2527
02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just show us if you.</v>

2528
02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I think if you put that on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be monetized and possibly kicked</v>

2529
02:02:55.641 --> 02:02:57.230
<v Speaker 2>off their network to Google that </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

2530
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google it.</v>

2531
02:02:58.281 --> 02:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>You weirdo and be careful of the wrath </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the government.</v>

2532
02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Enormous structure that I think we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't fully understand.</v>

2533
02:03:04.251 --> 02:03:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how we could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed it,</v>

2534
02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:07.213
<v Speaker 2>but my understanding was we didn't fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the internal cliteracy there </v>

2535
02:03:12.590 --> 02:03:16.250
<v Speaker 2>on the left below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly like this sort of space</v>

2536
02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:21.050
<v Speaker 2>ships from war of the worlds 1953.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all that stuff on the outside.</v>

2537
02:03:21.590 --> 02:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>All you see on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little tip at the top,</v>

2538
02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.280
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get in trouble.</v>

2539
02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:29.450
<v Speaker 2>They get mad at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that picture make you horny?</v>

2540
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

2541
02:03:31.610 --> 02:03:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

2542
02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:36.140
<v Speaker 2>It seems like an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should shoot laser blogger like that's</v>

2543
02:03:36.141 --> 02:03:39.050
<v Speaker 2>the Ridley Scott Alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The face hugger.</v>

2544
02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2545
02:03:42.001 --> 02:03:42.834
<v Speaker 2>just the look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird that we've just come to </v>

2546
02:03:44.601 --> 02:03:48.380
<v Speaker 2>accept what the shape of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His body is very bizarre.</v>

2547
02:03:48.590 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we were all shaped like sting </v>
<v Speaker 2>rays and we saw a person,</v>

2548
02:03:51.561 --> 02:03:52.394
<v Speaker 2>we'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the holy fuck is that thing </v>

2549
02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:55.603
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's articulating fingers and it's </v>

2550
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:58.310
<v Speaker 2>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's eyeballs,</v>

2551
02:03:58.311 --> 02:04:00.140
<v Speaker 2>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sniffing things,</v>

2552
02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:00.974
<v Speaker 2>but its nostrils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we just accept the fact that this </v>

2553
02:04:02.871 --> 02:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>shape is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is normal,</v>

2554
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:05.990
<v Speaker 2>that it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2555
02:04:05.991 --> 02:04:06.824
<v Speaker 2>this is why cephalopods from last time </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were talking about the </v>

2556
02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:09.920
<v Speaker 2>cuttlefish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2557
02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:11.780
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just learned something new,</v>

2558
02:04:11.781 --> 02:04:16.781
<v Speaker 2>which is the cephalopods are under </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration to be the next great model</v>

2559
02:04:16.821 --> 02:04:18.380
<v Speaker 2>organism for biology.</v>

2560
02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:19.813
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about how weird it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that some branch of the phylogenetic </v>

2561
02:04:23.001 --> 02:04:23.834
<v Speaker 2>tree is so far distant from us that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these mollusks have such advanced minds </v>

2562
02:04:27.561 --> 02:04:28.394
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their skin is the wonder of the world </v>

2563
02:04:31.341 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2564
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows quite how all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only do they have these chromatic to</v>

2565
02:04:37.681 --> 02:04:38.514
<v Speaker 2>get the camouflage right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also changed the texture of </v>

2566
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:43.450
<v Speaker 2>their skin to mimic things like coral </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff.</v>

2567
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:44.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be cool if we made </v>

2568
02:04:46.741 --> 02:04:47.574
<v Speaker 2>cephalopods the next great model </v>
<v Speaker 2>organism and then we started doing </v>

2569
02:04:49.981 --> 02:04:50.814
<v Speaker 2>comparative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not only neuroanatomy but </v>

2570
02:04:52.891 --> 02:04:53.724
<v Speaker 2>connectomics where we're trying to study</v>
<v Speaker 2>how their brains are organized because </v>

2571
02:04:57.361 --> 02:04:58.194
<v Speaker 2>they're so far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably the closest we will </v>

2572
02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:01.584
<v Speaker 2>ever get to meeting aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I said that the last time was </v>

2573
02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:06.240
<v Speaker 2>here and I'm really excited if that goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

2574
02:05:06.630 --> 02:05:07.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really doesn't seem like anything </v>

2575
02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:08.880
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2576
02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2577
02:05:09.590 --> 02:05:11.790
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a cuttlefish or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an octopus like it,</v>

2578
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:12.421
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2579
02:05:12.421 --> 02:05:13.800
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like a squid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2580
02:05:14.490 --> 02:05:15.323
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit like a person's like a </v>

2581
02:05:17.131 --> 02:05:18.390
<v Speaker 2>monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2582
02:05:18.391 --> 02:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>But like real different than Nautilus is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the craziest.</v>

2583
02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the cuddle fish is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting for sure.</v>

2584
02:05:24.851 --> 02:05:28.190
<v Speaker 2>But they're both intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2585
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>But like you regenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another part of it.</v>

2586
02:05:30.751 --> 02:05:32.790
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2587
02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Well it'd be fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2588
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:36.593
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that Knutson Salamanders</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the tetrapod category would be the </v>

2589
02:05:39.571 --> 02:05:43.230
<v Speaker 2>best for us to study for regeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how they regenerate up to a point</v>

2590
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:44.400
<v Speaker 2>like nature say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2591
02:05:44.401 --> 02:05:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you can grow an arm back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinko head back.</v>

2592
02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck face.</v>

2593
02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:48.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2594
02:05:48.570 --> 02:05:50.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose your head nature.</v>

2595
02:05:50.191 --> 02:05:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2596
02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:54.990
<v Speaker 2>you gave up a big piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave up the queen over.</v>

2597
02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Game's over.</v>

2598
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 2>So you thought if you lose your tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's debatable.</v>

2599
02:05:59.450 --> 02:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you grow your tail back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do that,</v>

2600
02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:03.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lizards grow their tail back,</v>

2601
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:06.780
<v Speaker 2>but they only grow like most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't grow the whole thing,</v>

2602
02:06:06.810 --> 02:06:07.643
<v Speaker 2>but the knutson salamanders seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have very high regena and you can just </v>

2603
02:06:11.101 --> 02:06:13.550
<v Speaker 2>get in an arm off over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

2604
02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:15.360
<v Speaker 2>We can't cut their head off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2605
02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Why do you wanna cut their head off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2606
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean just saying it's weird,</v>

2607
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:22.020
<v Speaker 2>like you can't like chop them in half </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the waist down.</v>

2608
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.350
<v Speaker 2>They don't seal up and grow a new waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's it.</v>

2609
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.070
<v Speaker 2>You can only get rid of the limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2610
02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.133
<v Speaker 2>but you can get rid of the limps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nature is evolved a strategy for </v>

2611
02:06:32.041 --> 02:06:32.874
<v Speaker 2>dealing with probation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give them the arm given the ticket </v>

2612
02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:35.790
<v Speaker 2>pop.</v>

2613
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:37.380
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of the fact that we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2614
02:06:37.381 --> 02:06:38.214
<v Speaker 2>a successful head transplant in monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early seventies and then we </v>

2615
02:06:41.731 --> 02:06:43.980
<v Speaker 2>walked away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably good move.</v>

2616
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:45.233
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise chicks at Beverly Hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be getting new bodies just getting </v>

2617
02:06:48.151 --> 02:06:49.770
<v Speaker 2>their head screwed on to new release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2618
02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.510
<v Speaker 2>get new heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2619
02:06:51.511 --> 02:06:54.270
<v Speaker 2>People would figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transplant the brains.</v>

2620
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2621
02:06:55.901 --> 02:06:56.734
<v Speaker 2>I just have an 800 year old brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about how your old motorcycle </v>

2622
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:02.420
<v Speaker 2>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2623
02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:05.040
<v Speaker 2>so people are going to start doing well </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

2624
02:07:05.041 --> 02:07:05.874
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's thing that we walked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was kind of a a weird move </v>

2625
02:07:08.791 --> 02:07:10.770
<v Speaker 2>that will succeed at that and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2626
02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:13.920
<v Speaker 2>too much can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's what they did?</v>

2627
02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably hard to get funding.</v>

2628
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.270
<v Speaker 2>People thought you were playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2629
02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.673
<v Speaker 2>the guy who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was maybe his name is Robert </v>

2630
02:07:21.330 --> 02:07:23.550
<v Speaker 2>White and he was a devout Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was really.</v>

2631
02:07:23.970 --> 02:07:24.803
<v Speaker 2>It was good because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of this reverence for </v>

2632
02:07:28.170 --> 02:07:31.290
<v Speaker 2>the human form and if a religious person</v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing it,</v>

2633
02:07:31.291 --> 02:07:33.570
<v Speaker 2>we feel better than if somebody is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>desecrating.</v>

2634
02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.321
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2635
02:07:34.321 --> 02:07:35.154
<v Speaker 2>Some atheist as scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's cutting heads off dogs and </v>

2636
02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Maria attaching them to monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2637
02:07:42.771 --> 02:07:45.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what's also like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of it as like,</v>

2638
02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:46.293
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing if you're trying out </v>

2639
02:07:46.931 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 2>medicine on a monkey that might save </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>

2640
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:51.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's another thing if you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2641
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:53.170
<v Speaker 2>what happens if I cut this monkey's head</v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

2642
02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.470
<v Speaker 2>stick it on another monkey where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this crazy.</v>

2643
02:07:56.471 --> 02:08:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians had this film introduced by</v>

2644
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:02.194
<v Speaker 2>Jbs Haldane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great English biologist who was also a </v>

2645
02:08:04.331 --> 02:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>communist and therefore very pro Soviet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's this experiment,</v>

2646
02:08:09.010 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was experiments in a continuation of the</v>

2647
02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:18.600
<v Speaker 2>brain after death and they hook up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head to an artificial circulatory system</v>

2648
02:08:20.410 --> 02:08:21.243
<v Speaker 2>and they sort of continued to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions where they swab the head </v>

2649
02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:28.660
<v Speaker 2>and they get the eyelash movement in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tongue comes out and eat things.</v>

2650
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:31.540
<v Speaker 2>It's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend it.</v>

2651
02:08:31.890 --> 02:08:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How Dean has one of the greatest quotes,</v>

2652
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:38.410
<v Speaker 2>not only as the universe queer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you suppose it's queer.</v>

2653
02:08:38.411 --> 02:08:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Then we can suppose what a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also the inordinate fondness,</v>

2654
02:08:42.851 --> 02:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>a Beatles guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inordinate fondness needles.</v>

2655
02:08:46.250 --> 02:08:49.810
<v Speaker 2>The Archbishop of Canterbury found </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

2656
02:08:49.811 --> 02:08:50.644
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seated across from how Dane and wanted </v>

2657
02:08:52.871 --> 02:08:55.600
<v Speaker 2>to needle him because he was a communist</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist and he said,</v>

2658
02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me what,</v>

2659
02:08:58.220 --> 02:08:59.053
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does your study of the biological </v>

2660
02:09:00.581 --> 02:09:04.700
<v Speaker 2>would inform us about how great creator </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how they shot him back.</v>

2661
02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:08.200
<v Speaker 2>He said that he has an inordinate </v>
<v Speaker 2>fondness for beetles because beetles are</v>

2662
02:09:08.201 --> 02:09:11.560
<v Speaker 2>so highly speciated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was his reaction to that?</v>

2663
02:09:12.730 --> 02:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a different era,</v>

2664
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 2>like smoked burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like to our,</v>

2665
02:09:16.271 --> 02:09:19.720
<v Speaker 2>to our way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that hard of a burn.</v>

2666
02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:20.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're really committed to the idea that </v>

2667
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:25.390
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that we can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulating the planet,</v>

2668
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:26.733
<v Speaker 2>sending rockets into space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's more important than what an </v>

2669
02:09:28.901 --> 02:09:29.710
<v Speaker 2>ant does.</v>

2670
02:09:29.710 --> 02:09:32.500
<v Speaker 2>What we're really committed to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our significance,</v>

2671
02:09:32.501 --> 02:09:34.360
<v Speaker 2>although it's clearly if we're working </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

2672
02:09:34.361 --> 02:09:37.390
<v Speaker 2>we believe in a sense of community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more important to eat each other.</v>

2673
02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:40.840
<v Speaker 2>To us it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the whole thing is it really more</v>

2674
02:09:40.841 --> 02:09:44.050
<v Speaker 2>important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says you mean if people didn't exist,</v>

2675
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.780
<v Speaker 2>we were wiped off the planet by all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals.</v>

2676
02:09:46.781 --> 02:09:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Would it be okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2677
02:09:48.041 --> 02:09:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2678
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:50.194
<v Speaker 2>we would gain and lose more predators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we wouldn't be controlling the </v>

2679
02:09:53.291 --> 02:09:54.124
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2680
02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:58.660
<v Speaker 2>But if all the aunts went away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a wrap.</v>

2681
02:09:59.170 --> 02:10:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a wrap.</v>

2682
02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:03.400
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more people.</v>

2683
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:07.880
<v Speaker 2>This hasn't been widely decided that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we lost all insect book,</v>

2684
02:10:07.890 --> 02:10:08.723
<v Speaker 2>especially all ants like it probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>would collapse all the ecosystems that </v>

2685
02:10:12.851 --> 02:10:13.684
<v Speaker 2>we need to sustain human life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling that those waterbury </v>

2686
02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.050
<v Speaker 2>tardigrades would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>

2687
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I got rid of the ads were the only ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

2688
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be able to make it,</v>

2689
02:10:22.541 --> 02:10:25.260
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of shit would make it a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff.</v>

2690
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:26.183
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that I think maybe we'd </v>

2691
02:10:28.631 --> 02:10:30.130
<v Speaker 2>make it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're wrong.</v>

2692
02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Just don't understand human trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>freak us out.</v>

2693
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe didn't read the Fi.</v>

2694
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Find out if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If all aunts died,</v>

2695
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:42.920
<v Speaker 2>human beings would go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Google that I think.</v>

2696
02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:43.873
<v Speaker 2>I think I read a paper proposing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were explaining the critical </v>

2697
02:10:47.421 --> 02:10:48.254
<v Speaker 2>role that ants play in all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ecosystems and how the bio </v>

2698
02:10:51.091 --> 02:10:51.924
<v Speaker 2>mass of ants worldwide is equal to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater than the biomass of human </v>

2699
02:10:56.661 --> 02:10:57.540
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2700
02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:01.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any intuition around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2701
02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.200
<v Speaker 2>sounds reasonable though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that's true.</v>

2702
02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our ideas that were more important.</v>

2703
02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>

2704
02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I have cable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2705
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think we're more four g,</v>

2706
02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:12.880
<v Speaker 2>four G.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2707
02:11:12.881 --> 02:11:17.881
<v Speaker 2>That maybe that's more important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a 70 inch television and,</v>

2708
02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.040
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an Iwatch.</v>

2709
02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be more important than stupid.</v>

2710
02:11:22.411 --> 02:11:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Fucking ant was dirt house.</v>

2711
02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>If I can just piss on your house while I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go jogging.</v>

2712
02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a more.</v>

2713
02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:33.270
<v Speaker 2>A more important thing than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2714
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My intuition half your people by pissing</v>

2715
02:11:37.111 --> 02:11:38.550
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2716
02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Obviously nature is want to protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got your house in the dirt.</v>

2717
02:11:42.450 --> 02:11:44.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole mound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2718
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I want to get serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2719
02:11:46.651 --> 02:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>You're just trying to fuck with me.</v>

2720
02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:50.493
<v Speaker 1>The really interesting thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans is that we're the only species </v>

2721
02:11:52.791 --> 02:11:55.880
<v Speaker 1>that understands what game we're in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can reject the game.</v>

2722
02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Every other species is playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2723
02:11:58.311 --> 02:11:59.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2724
02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother very well,</v>

2725
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:02.743
<v Speaker 1>very surprising to me that my brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>only wanted to have two kids and didn't </v>

2726
02:12:05.481 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 1>want to spend all his time down at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm bank.</v>

2727
02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:08.781
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2728
02:12:08.781 --> 02:12:09.980
<v Speaker 1>making donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2729
02:12:09.981 --> 02:12:10.814
<v Speaker 1>you're an evolutionary theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever think it's kind of weird that </v>

2730
02:12:13.011 --> 02:12:15.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not playing this game very </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively?</v>

2731
02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And he shot me back this thing he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually understand the game,</v>

2732
02:12:19.401 --> 02:12:20.990
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to continue to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

2733
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that somebody who sounds like his wife</v>

2734
02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:31.160
<v Speaker 2>does want anymore kids rationalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

2735
02:12:31.161 --> 02:12:32.660
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:36.950
<v Speaker 2>The article I found says all all insects</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying,</v>

2737
02:12:36.951 --> 02:12:38.040
<v Speaker 2>not just answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2738
02:12:38.090 --> 02:12:38.923
<v Speaker 2>insects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we take 50 years for people to </v>

2739
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:42.070
<v Speaker 2>disappear for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to this,</v>

2740
02:12:42.071 --> 02:12:44.240
<v Speaker 2>a science explorer article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2741
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:48.440
<v Speaker 2>find out the biomass of ants because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even trippier</v>

2742
02:12:51.710 --> 02:12:52.260
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2743
02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but I want to get rid of this anti human</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because I'm not answering.</v>

2744
02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2745
02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:58.710
<v Speaker 1>you're assuming neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing biologically neutral.</v>

2746
02:12:58.830 --> 02:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>If I just looked at it objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2747
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said you don't think so.</v>

2748
02:13:02.071 --> 02:13:05.100
<v Speaker 1>You think it's more significant because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're more significant to each other?</v>

2749
02:13:05.130 --> 02:13:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no significance in the whole </v>

2750
02:13:06.601 --> 02:13:08.560
<v Speaker 1>game if you just take completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>

2751
02:13:08.570 --> 02:13:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we care is one rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one SPEC,</v>

2752
02:13:10.591 --> 02:13:11.500
<v Speaker 1>big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2753
02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is if you accept that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an answer,</v>

2754
02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:16.493
<v Speaker 1>then you've kind of failed by just </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the nihilist way out and to me </v>

2755
02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:25.560
<v Speaker 1>like they have this annual question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that edge.org,</v>

2756
02:13:25.561 --> 02:13:28.470
<v Speaker 1>and then finally the guy got exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and want to ask another one.</v>

2757
02:13:28.471 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'll finish this up quick and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll you think I'm</v>

2758
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:32.580
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2759
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:35.040
<v Speaker 3>you want to take it and do our aunts </v>
<v Speaker 3>outweigh humans?</v>

2760
02:13:35.041 --> 02:13:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Individual workers way an average </v>
<v Speaker 3>between one to five milligrams according</v>

2761
02:13:38.821 --> 02:13:39.654
<v Speaker 3>to the species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When combined all ants in the world </v>

2762
02:13:42.181 --> 02:13:45.330
<v Speaker 3>taken together way about as much as all </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

2763
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:47.940
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2764
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2765
02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:54.450
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who they are,</v>

2766
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.313
<v Speaker 3>15 to 20 percent of the terrestrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal biomass and in tropical regions </v>

2767
02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.160
<v Speaker 3>where answer especially abundant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they monopolize 25 percent or more.</v>

2768
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:10.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm an after I have a buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Cowen,</v>

2769
02:14:10.490 --> 02:14:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Ryan accountant used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2770
02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:13.770
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was in college,</v>

2771
02:14:13.771 --> 02:14:14.604
<v Speaker 3>he spent some time in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was thinking he was going to be a </v>

2772
02:14:16.741 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 3>biologist and he was going to study </v>
<v Speaker 3>insect who's going to be in,</v>

2773
02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:21.493
<v Speaker 3>what is it in insectivore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they had to sleep in these </v>

2774
02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.073
<v Speaker 3>elevated tents and they had to paint </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some sort of like Turpentine type </v>

2775
02:14:31.801 --> 02:14:35.280
<v Speaker 3>chemical all over the posts because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't.</v>

2776
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:40.260
<v Speaker 3>The ants would crawl up the post and eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and your sleep would literally climb</v>

2777
02:14:40.261 --> 02:14:41.094
<v Speaker 3>in your ear and start eating you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell everybody and you would die that </v>

2778
02:14:44.431 --> 02:14:47.700
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people have died and elephants have</v>

2779
02:14:47.701 --> 02:14:48.534
<v Speaker 3>been eaten by ants and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hear them walking in the jungle </v>

2780
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.863
<v Speaker 3>like in the night you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear the footsteps of fucking ants </v>

2781
02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:00.083
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in the wrong place at the </v>

2782
02:15:01.471 --> 02:15:02.304
<v Speaker 3>wrong time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a path of these </v>

2783
02:15:03.781 --> 02:15:08.310
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers moving your way and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>send a signal that we got something here</v>

2784
02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 3>and they crawl up you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just all start crawling up you.</v>

2785
02:15:11.371 --> 02:15:12.840
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't avoid them</v>

2786
02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:15.570
<v Speaker 1>because they're not really separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals right there.</v>

2787
02:15:15.571 --> 02:15:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Use Social Hymenoptera has this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>property of this haplodiploid structures</v>

2788
02:15:20.130 --> 02:15:22.830
<v Speaker 1>so that the females are highly related </v>
<v Speaker 1>to each other.</v>

2789
02:15:23.190 --> 02:15:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And so in the same way that your cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't individual animals,</v>

2790
02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:28.373
<v Speaker 1>they all conspire to create you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a sense in which in this world </v>

2791
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:36.840
<v Speaker 1>of bees and ants and wasps and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

2792
02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.400
<v Speaker 1>my Hymenoptera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real entity is the colony.</v>

2793
02:15:41.401 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2794
02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:43.921
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2795
02:15:43.921 --> 02:15:46.740
<v Speaker 1>if I took a cytological approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2796
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 1>to you and I just went set cell by cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2797
02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're this collection of,</v>

2798
02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:52.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2799
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:57.830
<v Speaker 1>10 or 50 trillion separate entities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes ants so terrifying</v>

2800
02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.090
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2801
02:16:00.110 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Kropotkin and the great anarchistic a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an amateur naturalist.</v>

2802
02:16:03.961 --> 02:16:04.794
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would look to natural systems and </v>

2803
02:16:06.901 --> 02:16:09.150
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't humans cooperate like this?</v>

2804
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:10.343
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not structured to cooperate in </v>

2805
02:16:13.201 --> 02:16:17.700
<v Speaker 1>this use social fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they cooperate is so uncanny.</v>

2806
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.990
<v Speaker 1>When those leaf cutter ants designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>those intricate cities with,</v>

2807
02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:23.063
<v Speaker 1>they have places where things for meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and were gases are released through </v>

2808
02:16:26.881 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 1>holes in the ground and it doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>any</v>

2809
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>sense that this little tiny brain could </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out this enormous structure,</v>

2810
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:38.620
<v Speaker 3>but somehow or another when combined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not just any brain,</v>

2811
02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:40.150
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just one,</v>

2812
02:16:40.450 --> 02:16:41.283
<v Speaker 3>one version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but millions and millions of these </v>

2813
02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:48.850
<v Speaker 3>designs appear all over the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they see if he could find that video.</v>

2814
02:16:48.851 --> 02:16:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Have they filled a leaf cutter ant </v>
<v Speaker 3>colony?</v>

2815
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:54.830
<v Speaker 3>They filled the home with molten metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2816
02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:58.170
<v Speaker 3>It was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2817
02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:00.790
<v Speaker 3>I think they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They flooded it with concrete.</v>

2818
02:17:00.791 --> 02:17:01.624
<v Speaker 3>They flooded concrete in all the holes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they dug out everything around </v>

2819
02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:08.200
<v Speaker 3>it so you could see this structure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they explained what.</v>

2820
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:10.063
<v Speaker 3>This is really well thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they have portals and they have </v>

2821
02:17:13.241 --> 02:17:14.074
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how they get the food in and </v>

2822
02:17:15.161 --> 02:17:16.780
<v Speaker 3>this is where they take the leaves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2823
02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:17.753
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they let them rot and turn into mulch </v>

2824
02:17:19.541 --> 02:17:20.374
<v Speaker 3>and there's like a gas remedies </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed loosely coupled system </v>

2825
02:17:23.441 --> 02:17:23.530
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

2826
02:17:23.530 --> 02:17:27.220
<v Speaker 3>It makes it seem so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is utterly amazing.</v>

2827
02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:32.280
<v Speaker 3>But if you think about it as individuals</v>
<v Speaker 3>making decisions that conspire to create</v>

2828
02:17:32.531 --> 02:17:34.180
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these structures,</v>

2829
02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:36.100
<v Speaker 3>it's less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2830
02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:40.000
<v Speaker 3>that's more amazing than what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2831
02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a loosely coupled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a distributed system,</v>

2832
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:45.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's how a bee hive will send out </v>

2833
02:17:49.241 --> 02:17:50.074
<v Speaker 3>explorers and they'll report back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll do the dance and the dance </v>

2834
02:17:53.081 --> 02:17:57.280
<v Speaker 3>communicates the information and you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these coordinated activities.</v>

2835
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:58.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what other systems do you suppress </v>

2836
02:18:01.331 --> 02:18:06.331
<v Speaker 3>the fertility of females because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatedness is so high.</v>

2837
02:18:06.551 --> 02:18:07.690
<v Speaker 3>This is gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2838
02:18:07.691 --> 02:18:11.830
<v Speaker 3>This is the video we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is really huge too.</v>

2839
02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:13.203
<v Speaker 3>And they have these looks like tunnel </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems and then they lead to these big </v>

2840
02:18:18.281 --> 02:18:23.281
<v Speaker 3>circular areas where they're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost uniform in size and it's a really</v>

2841
02:18:23.741 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 3>strange way or similar in size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

2842
02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:29.960
<v Speaker 3>So they have these pathways that go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these like rooms,</v>

2843
02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:30.923
<v Speaker 3>you circular rooms and there's just this</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible network of these tubes and </v>

2844
02:18:37.781 --> 02:18:38.614
<v Speaker 3>circular rooms that they uncover and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking enormous when you look at </v>

2845
02:18:42.611 --> 02:18:43.444
<v Speaker 3>how big this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you had to like how big is </v>

2846
02:18:45.761 --> 02:18:47.830
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that 80 feet across,</v>

2847
02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:50.560
<v Speaker 3>90 feet across or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

2848
02:18:50.561 --> 02:18:52.900
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're continuing to dig this up.</v>

2849
02:18:52.901 --> 02:18:54.670
<v Speaker 3>They're not even done in this video </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2850
02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:57.640
<v Speaker 3>but you see all the pipes that extend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and to the right.</v>

2851
02:18:57.641 --> 02:19:01.360
<v Speaker 3>So they've developed some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex civilization,</v>

2852
02:19:01.630 --> 02:19:02.463
<v Speaker 3>some weird bizarre network of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>passageways and rooms and they do it </v>

2853
02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:09.813
<v Speaker 3>just like this everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some pattern has emerged in their </v>

2854
02:19:14.291 --> 02:19:15.124
<v Speaker 3>species that has set them up to act as </v>
<v Speaker 3>this collective group and then operate </v>

2855
02:19:22.231 --> 02:19:26.520
<v Speaker 3>in a similar fashion all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wherever they exist in that sort of with</v>

2856
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.370
<v Speaker 3>that kind of dirt they can manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2857
02:19:28.371 --> 02:19:33.371
<v Speaker 3>That that's dad alone is one that is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive mystery.</v>

2858
02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:34.553
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a little tiny thing with a brain </v>

2859
02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:39.050
<v Speaker 3>that's almost imperceptibly small.</v>

2860
02:19:39.690 --> 02:19:40.523
<v Speaker 1>This is like tiny little head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his little head was he figured out that </v>

2861
02:19:44.011 --> 02:19:44.844
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you figuring out tunnels that </v>

2862
02:19:46.231 --> 02:19:48.870
<v Speaker 1>he's not really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm trying to get out there</v>

2863
02:19:48.871 --> 02:19:50.700
<v Speaker 1>working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2864
02:19:50.701 --> 02:19:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2865
02:19:52.290 --> 02:19:53.123
<v Speaker 1>Si elegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nematode with a thousand cells for </v>

2866
02:19:55.861 --> 02:19:58.530
<v Speaker 1>the entire body plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 of which are neurons.</v>

2867
02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.000
<v Speaker 1>We have a complete map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only of the cell lineage diagram,</v>

2868
02:20:03.001 --> 02:20:06.570
<v Speaker 1>which is how this thing unfolds from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single fertilized egg,</v>

2869
02:20:07.290 --> 02:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>but we also have a complete wiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram of its nervous system.</v>

2870
02:20:11.430 --> 02:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that locomotive </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves around and eats,</v>

2871
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:15.023
<v Speaker 1>has sex and it's only got 300 neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of those is extremely primitive </v>

2872
02:20:21.241 --> 02:20:22.074
<v Speaker 1>machine and they send signals to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and we still don't know that how </v>

2873
02:20:24.941 --> 02:20:25.774
<v Speaker 1>the thing really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though we've got the entire thing </v>

2874
02:20:27.451 --> 02:20:29.260
<v Speaker 1>mapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

2875
02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:34.050
<v Speaker 1>this was the great insight of Sydney </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brenner that we would make the,</v>

2876
02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the worm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2877
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the great model organism because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually map everything about it.</v>

2878
02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:42.233
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is astounding to me how little </v>

2879
02:20:44.881 --> 02:20:46.980
<v Speaker 1>we've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've learned a ton from it,</v>

2880
02:20:47.850 --> 02:20:48.683
<v Speaker 1>but I had thought that we would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten much farther and understanding </v>

2881
02:20:52.051 --> 02:20:52.884
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

2882
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Did you see this recent discovery of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>25 foot long sea worm that apparently is</v>

2883
02:21:01.191 --> 02:21:06.191
<v Speaker 3>not just one organism has many organisms</v>
<v Speaker 3>together combined?</v>

2884
02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:08.480
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2885
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I've got to find out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:21:11.031 --> 02:21:11.864
<v Speaker 3>You got to see this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane and I think there's a very </v>

2887
02:21:15.681 --> 02:21:16.514
<v Speaker 3>recent discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least one this large and these guys </v>

2888
02:21:19.551 --> 02:21:23.150
<v Speaker 3>are swimming around with this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks impossible.</v>

2889
02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.013
<v Speaker 3>It looks like they landed on another </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet and they're experiencing this </v>

2890
02:21:28.401 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 3>thing like this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whatever this is.</v>

2891
02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:33.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that what I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read it really quickly as I was </v>

2892
02:21:36.171 --> 02:21:41.171
<v Speaker 3>running out the door that it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Large eight mil eight meter worm,</v>

2893
02:21:41.681 --> 02:21:44.330
<v Speaker 3>like sea creature stuns New Zealand </v>
<v Speaker 3>divers,</v>

2894
02:21:44.331 --> 02:21:45.164
<v Speaker 3>so they're looking at this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's many different </v>

2895
02:21:47.121 --> 02:21:50.150
<v Speaker 3>organisms inside of it and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one individual organism.</v>

2896
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made up of hundreds of thousands of</v>

2897
02:21:55.431 --> 02:21:56.770
<v Speaker 3>organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that.</v>

2898
02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2899
02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:02.000
<v Speaker 3>What is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2900
02:22:03.010 --> 02:22:03.843
<v Speaker 3>Is this is a weird tube for folks that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are watching this or listening to this </v>

2901
02:22:07.131 --> 02:22:07.964
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're looking at is these divers </v>

2902
02:22:09.231 --> 02:22:11.180
<v Speaker 3>that are just tripping balls here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

2903
02:22:11.181 --> 02:22:16.181
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it looks like like an enormous tube,</v>

2904
02:22:16.191 --> 02:22:19.340
<v Speaker 3>like Jelly fish type creature that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water.</v>

2905
02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:21.410
<v Speaker 3>It almost looks semi translucent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2906
02:22:21.411 --> 02:22:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this tour Finland,</v>

2907
02:22:23.390 --> 02:22:25.130
<v Speaker 3>it's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

2908
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like the size and what moves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes,</v>

2909
02:22:29.671 --> 02:22:30.504
<v Speaker 2>but at sometimes it's larger than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human waste or a human chest and other </v>

2910
02:22:35.011 --> 02:22:39.540
<v Speaker 2>times it gets real skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fucking huge.</v>

2911
02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Like look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that thing that.</v>

2912
02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm stunned by the fact that it's like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand what they're saying,</v>

2913
02:22:46.801 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 2>that it's made up of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of organisms.</v>

2914
02:22:49.201 --> 02:22:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Like how is it made up of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>

2915
02:22:51.361 --> 02:22:52.194
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of anything like </v>

2916
02:22:53.821 --> 02:22:56.190
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the Portuguese man of war I think</v>

2917
02:22:56.191 --> 02:22:58.650
<v Speaker 2>is like five different organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2918
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.293
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The collaborate in effect really the </v>

2919
02:23:03.271 --> 02:23:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Portuguese man of war is not like a one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2920
02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of that thing above the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2921
02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:14.540
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piracy home.</v>

2922
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:19.250
<v Speaker 2>Just whatever the ocean is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're all.</v>

2923
02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:20.193
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to look into space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wonder if there's aliens out </v>

2924
02:23:22.161 --> 02:23:24.200
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

2925
02:23:25.690 --> 02:23:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's cuddle fish or octopus or </v>
<v Speaker 2>this goddamn thing.</v>

2926
02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pyro Psalm.</v>

2927
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:34.670
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing looks like.</v>

2928
02:23:34.671 --> 02:23:38.420
<v Speaker 2>A geometric pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a nice one.</v>

2929
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the upper right hand corner.</v>

2930
02:23:40.071 --> 02:23:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that weird looking fucking.</v>

2931
02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>What is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 foot long jet powered animal.</v>

2932
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a civilization.</v>

2933
02:23:49.401 --> 02:23:52.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like a ship of these things flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the ocean.</v>

2934
02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen this before?</v>

2935
02:23:55.370 --> 02:23:58.610
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so weird looking.</v>

2936
02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:00.081
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

2937
02:24:00.081 --> 02:24:02.020
<v Speaker 2>That looks like something from Avatar </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

2938
02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it totally does.</v>

2939
02:24:03.891 --> 02:24:04.724
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like something that comes up that tree </v>

2940
02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:08.180
<v Speaker 2>hopefully put it in the new movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:24:08.181 --> 02:24:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Tell Call James Cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this thing.</v>

2942
02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:13.123
<v Speaker 2>So this is what those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other one is a very smooth or </v>

2943
02:24:15.941 --> 02:24:18.320
<v Speaker 2>it's low resolution and we can't get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good look at it.</v>

2944
02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:19.633
<v Speaker 2>But that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this collective group of hundreds of </v>

2945
02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:22.933
<v Speaker 2>thousands of organisms that combined </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and they're getting jacked by </v>

2946
02:24:25.611 --> 02:24:27.800
<v Speaker 2>that turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you bitches.</v>

2947
02:24:30.890 --> 02:24:31.723
<v Speaker 2>What a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird organisms that look at this </v>

2948
02:24:34.851 --> 02:24:38.090
<v Speaker 2>picture if you stuck your arm in it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it just.</v>

2949
02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bizarre is it?</v>

2950
02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>The disease of civilization of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things all combined.</v>

2951
02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:48.560
<v Speaker 2>But what they are is individuals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate as a giant tube.</v>

2952
02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:53.990
<v Speaker 2>You never heard of this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm so happy we found something.</v>

2953
02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:57.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't know about your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2954
02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:01.150
<v Speaker 2>That was fucking weird one man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the.</v>

2955
02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:02.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the ocean is really an </v>

2956
02:25:03.211 --> 02:25:04.620
<v Speaker 2>alien world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2957
02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:06.143
<v Speaker 2>Well the funniest part is when you hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys with their remote </v>

2958
02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:12.930
<v Speaker 2>submersibles and they find some new life</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

2959
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2960
02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:15.870
<v Speaker 2>take me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me.</v>

2961

2962
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:22.100
<v Speaker 2>What does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get really excited because it's,</v>

2963
02:25:22.930 --> 02:25:25.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the ability to meet aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are new things.</v>

2964
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

2965
02:25:26.501 --> 02:25:31.110
<v Speaker 2>we've Kinda sorta mapped out the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less or.</v>

2966
02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a few weird things you find</v>

2967
02:25:33.401 --> 02:25:34.600
<v Speaker 2>in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird bugs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam has some surprises for us here </v>

<v Speaker 2>with fangs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I Dunno about vampires here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the craziest looking thing ever.</v>

2974
02:25:47.561 --> 02:25:48.394
<v Speaker 2>It's deer with fangs like crocodile look</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fangs that come hanging down like </v>

2975
02:25:52.631 --> 02:25:54.790
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is some jackalope thing.</v>

2976
02:25:54.850 --> 02:25:55.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

2977
02:25:55.841 --> 02:25:58.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird little animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big deer either.</v>

2978
02:25:58.690 --> 02:25:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know?</v>

2979
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear.</v>

2980
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:05.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a real animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2981
02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:09.240
<v Speaker 2>How fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

2982
02:26:09.241 --> 02:26:10.630
<v Speaker 2>What was in this coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

2983
02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing will get their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking teeth on that thing.</v>

2984
02:26:15.490 --> 02:26:19.240
<v Speaker 2>It's probably something akin to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>antlers.</v>

2985
02:26:19.241 --> 02:26:20.830
<v Speaker 2>They use it to defend themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2986
02:26:20.831 --> 02:26:22.660
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Real,</v>

2987
02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:23.733
<v Speaker 2>because that's a mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that one that you just pick some </v>

2988
02:26:26.351 --> 02:26:30.910
<v Speaker 2>photoshop bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is apparently I'm elk</v>

2989
02:26:30.911 --> 02:26:34.480
<v Speaker 2>have these things called the people call</v>
<v Speaker 2>them Ivoree's now,</v>

2990
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:35.583
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they are is at one point in time </v>

2991
02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:40.470
<v Speaker 2>they had tusks like a boar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like giant toss.</v>

2992
02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:41.313
<v Speaker 2>It probably aided them in their fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they eventually shrank and now </v>

2993
02:26:45.671 --> 02:26:48.400
<v Speaker 2>they're just this weird sort of nubby </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2994
02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually have some here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show it to you.</v>

2995
02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:51.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The after the podcast will show them to </v>

2996
02:26:53.561 --> 02:26:54.394
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

2997
02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:57.910
<v Speaker 2>they're this weird thing that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a tooth.</v>

2998
02:26:58.090 --> 02:27:00.370
<v Speaker 2>It's ivory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It grows inside their head.</v>

2999
02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And at one point in time it was some </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a weapon,</v>

3000
02:27:02.681 --> 02:27:04.360
<v Speaker 2>just like their head is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the antlers,</v>

3001
02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the largest.</v>

3002
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:09.140
<v Speaker 2>How do we describe this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>

3003
02:27:09.141 --> 02:27:09.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3004
02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.760
<v Speaker 2>the quickest growing thing in the animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is the,</v>

3005
02:27:15.471 --> 02:27:18.790
<v Speaker 2>the antlers of an elk because look how </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking huge they are.</v>

3006
02:27:18.791 --> 02:27:19.624
<v Speaker 2>They fall off every year and they grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>back every year and it's all just for </v>

3007
02:27:22.811 --> 02:27:23.644
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they used to grow back tusks to </v>

3008
02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:27.880
<v Speaker 2>where they used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The acid tests were permanent,</v>

3009
02:27:28.270 --> 02:27:29.103
<v Speaker 2>but they used to just.</v>

3010
02:27:29.390 --> 02:27:32.980
<v Speaker 2>That's just for Duking it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy weaponry,</v>

3011
02:27:32.981 --> 02:27:34.850
<v Speaker 2>sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3012
02:27:34.970 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you went into a really weird thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dung Beetle,</v>

3013
02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:38.313
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a conserved system whereby in </v>

3014
02:27:41.231 --> 02:27:42.064
<v Speaker 2>some dung beetles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of weaponry you have as your </v>

3015
02:27:44.201 --> 02:27:49.201
<v Speaker 2>antler is inversely proportional to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of military apparatus you have,</v>

3016
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:51.543
<v Speaker 2>where it counts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have really impressive </v>

3017
02:27:56.050 --> 02:28:00.250
<v Speaker 2>weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not able to do quite as much,</v>

3018
02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:01.263
<v Speaker 2>and that may be the engine of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speciations because the vagina and </v>

3019
02:28:04.871 --> 02:28:07.030
<v Speaker 2>penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that system is a lock and key.</v>

3020
02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:11.260
<v Speaker 2>And so if something shrinks too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can't necessarily get,</v>

3021
02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:13.180
<v Speaker 2>get the Job Sofa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greedy.</v>

3022
02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Dung beetle with giant horns just fucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody up.</v>

3023
02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:17.673
<v Speaker 2>His genes can pass on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a certain amount of </v>

3024
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:21.710
<v Speaker 2>cooperation is needed in the dung world.</v>

3025
02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Can have an oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a gang,</v>

3026
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:25.334
<v Speaker 1>is con of the Dung Beetle world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Patriarchy and the Dung beetle </v>

3027
02:28:27.981 --> 02:28:28.814
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of the antler on that </v>

3028
02:28:29.871 --> 02:28:31.730
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but girls make fun of them.</v>

3029
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Probably the dung beetle world because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guy with the Lamborghini,</v>

3030
02:28:37.220 --> 02:28:40.340
<v Speaker 1>exactly like what's he doing over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these giant?</v>

3031
02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It looks like elk antlers probably is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little dick.</v>

3032
02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:45.380
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>

3033
02:28:45.381 --> 02:28:46.214
<v Speaker 1>God's just got little like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that guy probably probably hung </v>

3034
02:28:49.311 --> 02:28:51.130
<v Speaker 1>like a roach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3035
02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Have a hunting question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3036
02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I started looking into this primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting thing.</v>

3037
02:28:56.001 --> 02:29:01.001
<v Speaker 1>I was positively predisposed towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and I turned myself off of.</v>

3038
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:02.833
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I turned myself off of hunting by </v>

3039
02:29:06.081 --> 02:29:11.081
<v Speaker 1>watching the effect of some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are baiting and killing bears</v>

3040
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:12.703
<v Speaker 1>in ways that it just doesn't feel to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hyper respectful and I wondered if </v>

3041
02:29:19.881 --> 02:29:23.060
<v Speaker 1>there's like a deeper layer where if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got even deeper into it,</v>

3042
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:23.894
<v Speaker 1>I would understand it or am I actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct that there is something weird </v>

3043
02:29:27.951 --> 02:29:28.784
<v Speaker 1>about the effect of attracting some </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful bear to a kind of easy place </v>

3044
02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 1>to kill it and then just getting super </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about doing it in well,</v>

3045
02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:38.840
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

3046
02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:39.673
<v Speaker 3>your natural instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason for them and you're </v>

3047
02:29:42.291 --> 02:29:43.530
<v Speaker 3>most certainly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3048
02:29:43.531 --> 02:29:47.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you're going to trick this</v>

3049
02:29:47.031 --> 02:29:50.250
<v Speaker 3>bear and thinking he's going there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat and then you kill them.</v>

3050
02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Bear hunting is different than any other</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of haunting in the.</v>

3051
02:29:53.961 --> 02:29:56.120
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of emotional attachment to</v>

3052
02:29:56.121 --> 02:29:58.370
<v Speaker 3>it because people love teddy bears and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines,</v>

3053
02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:02.360
<v Speaker 3>but bears are this idea that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

3054
02:30:02.390 --> 02:30:04.400
<v Speaker 3>They've definitely are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely are.</v>

3055
02:30:04.401 --> 02:30:05.234
<v Speaker 3>They're also one of the more ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals in the animal kingdom and </v>

3056
02:30:07.881 --> 02:30:11.540
<v Speaker 3>they're all cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them and the males don't.</v>

3057
02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:12.433
<v Speaker 3>Don't just go after the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eat them and they go after them </v>

3058
02:30:16.161 --> 02:30:16.994
<v Speaker 3>specifically to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when the males get chased off </v>

3059
02:30:19.341 --> 02:30:20.960
<v Speaker 3>the female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what year on cubs,</v>

3060
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:25.010
<v Speaker 3>and this is universal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are also responsible for the death</v>

3061
02:30:25.011 --> 02:30:29.540
<v Speaker 3>of at least 50 percent of undulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>calves and Fonz,</v>

3062
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:31.310
<v Speaker 3>whether it's moose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cows,</v>

3063
02:30:31.311 --> 02:30:31.580
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

3064
02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:32.413
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any of these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they also are really difficult to </v>

3065
02:30:35.451 --> 02:30:38.240
<v Speaker 3>hunt and their populations thought by </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife.</v>

3066
02:30:38.241 --> 02:30:41.390
<v Speaker 3>Biologists are important to keep under </v>
<v Speaker 3>control by all of that.</v>

3067
02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:45.280
<v Speaker 3>So in areas of extreme density like </v>
<v Speaker 3>forest,</v>

3068
02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:49.100
<v Speaker 3>you will not kill them unless you bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will not.</v>

3069
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:51.560
<v Speaker 3>So if you one of two things has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

3070
02:30:51.561 --> 02:30:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Either they have to use dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what they used to use a lot.</v>

3071
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:56.150
<v Speaker 3>These used to be California until the 19</v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>

3072
02:30:56.151 --> 02:31:01.151
<v Speaker 3>They outlawed hound hunting and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>odd baiting around the same time.</v>

3073
02:31:01.611 --> 02:31:02.444
<v Speaker 3>What they essentially did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>northern cal in California is they </v>

3074
02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:06.200
<v Speaker 3>outlawed bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't.</v>

3075
02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:08.540
<v Speaker 3>You can still hunt bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's extremely difficult,</v>

3076
02:31:08.541 --> 02:31:11.060
<v Speaker 3>almost impossible with a bow or very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unlikely,</v>

3077
02:31:11.210 --> 02:31:16.210
<v Speaker 3>like your rate of success of extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>low if you want to control populations,</v>

3078
02:31:16.311 --> 02:31:17.144
<v Speaker 3>if you like to eat moose and deer or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to have them keep healthy </v>

3079
02:31:20.911 --> 02:31:21.744
<v Speaker 3>populations and you don't want the bare </v>
<v Speaker 3>encroaching on these rural homes and </v>

3080
02:31:25.561 --> 02:31:26.394
<v Speaker 3>these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to control their populations </v>

3081
02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:30.390
<v Speaker 3>and there's very few other ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>control them.</v>

3082
02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:31.473
<v Speaker 2>Relations other than baiting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so assume that I was positively </v>

3083
02:31:34.601 --> 02:31:35.434
<v Speaker 2>predisposed to hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that they're beautiful </v>

3084
02:31:36.911 --> 02:31:38.710
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're emotional creatures,</v>

3085
02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.770
<v Speaker 2>but I understand they're all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all beautiful.</v>

3086
02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3087
02:31:43.301 --> 02:31:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I think the frogs are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fascinating.</v>

3088
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's the effect that freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>

3089
02:31:48.610 --> 02:31:52.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird form of trickery and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's sporting right,</v>

3090
02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:57.340
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that if you really want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to control their populations,</v>

3091
02:31:57.341 --> 02:31:58.174
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary evil so that I grasped that </v>

3092
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:02.623
<v Speaker 2>it's still at the level that the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that surprised me was that the effect </v>

3093
02:32:08.441 --> 02:32:13.441
<v Speaker 2>wasn't the expected effect of the hunter</v>
<v Speaker 2>with reverence in some sense.</v>

3094
02:32:16.691 --> 02:32:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Sufficient reverence for the kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3095
02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:20.890
<v Speaker 2>that's what flipped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3096
02:32:20.891 --> 02:32:21.724
<v Speaker 2>there's people get excited and they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy that they're successful because </v>

3097
02:32:25.511 --> 02:32:28.210
<v Speaker 2>hunting is difficult and then if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take that into context,</v>

3098
02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:30.430
<v Speaker 2>if you take that out of context and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get happy,</v>

3099
02:32:30.431 --> 02:32:34.930
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting happy around people that</v>

3100
02:32:34.931 --> 02:32:39.931
<v Speaker 2>have no problem with hunting scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the problems with respect is that</v>

3101
02:32:40.001 --> 02:32:43.180
<v Speaker 2>it's assumed that you only have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect if you don't have happiness.</v>

3102
02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:44.013
<v Speaker 2>That goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that there is some amount </v>

3103
02:32:46.061 --> 02:32:46.894
<v Speaker 2>of sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some amount of happiness is a weird </v>

3104
02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:50.073
<v Speaker 2>feeling of loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of weird stuff that </v>

3105
02:32:51.791 --> 02:32:52.624
<v Speaker 2>goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprised,</v>

3106
02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:56.230
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm asking you is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I had expected that I would have</v>

3107
02:32:56.231 --> 02:33:00.580
<v Speaker 2>the difficulty bears equals teddy bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get past that.</v>

3108
02:33:00.730 --> 02:33:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I keep going around this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when I finally got to the end,</v>

3109
02:33:05.290 --> 02:33:06.123
<v Speaker 2>it was just the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't the right balance between </v>

3110
02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:13.270
<v Speaker 2>sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecstatic elation.</v>

3111
02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:16.130
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to.</v>

3112
02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:18.320
<v Speaker 3>It's hard if you're not there </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing it.</v>

3113
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:21.050
<v Speaker 3>It's hard if you're not involved in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt for many,</v>

3114
02:33:21.051 --> 02:33:21.884
<v Speaker 3>many days and it gets very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>when and you don't know if it's ever </v>

3115
02:33:24.141 --> 02:33:27.020
<v Speaker 3>going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bear hunting in particular,</v>

3116
02:33:27.021 --> 02:33:31.580
<v Speaker 3>especially over Bait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is way more problematic psychologically.</v>

3117
02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:32.753
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a really good argument </v>

3118
02:33:35.121 --> 02:33:39.050
<v Speaker 3>and I support this argument that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>must keep bear populations in control if</v>

3119
02:33:39.051 --> 02:33:41.930
<v Speaker 3>you want people and and all those other </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals to live in harmony.</v>

3120
02:33:41.931 --> 02:33:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you don't,</v>

3121
02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:44.233
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else that keeps your </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations in control by that other </v>

3122
02:33:46.371 --> 02:33:50.150
<v Speaker 3>than bigger bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly bears and grizzly bears and they</v>

3123
02:33:50.151 --> 02:33:53.210
<v Speaker 3>get out of hand our way scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real.</v>

3124
02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:56.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a real science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real giant problem in terms of our,</v>

3125
02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:01.190
<v Speaker 3>our anthropomorphization of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

3126
02:34:01.410 --> 02:34:02.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attaching these human attributes and </v>

3127
02:34:03.741 --> 02:34:04.574
<v Speaker 3>these human thoughts and thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them as our friends in the forest and </v>

3128
02:34:07.521 --> 02:34:09.620
<v Speaker 3>then what they actually are the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that live out there.</v>

3129
02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:10.483
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that if I went hunting with </v>

3130
02:34:13.191 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would expect to see elated after</v>

3131
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.820
<v Speaker 3>three days of frustration on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a good hunt.</v>

3132
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:26.200
<v Speaker 3>I expect that you would use the kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibly,</v>

3133
02:34:26.201 --> 02:34:29.140
<v Speaker 3>that you would forgo certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kilz.</v>

3134
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:32.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any of those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3135
02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:37.270
<v Speaker 3>I think that where the issue is is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't expect an unbalanced elation.</v>

3136
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:38.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand what you're saying and </v>

3137
02:34:40.151 --> 02:34:43.540
<v Speaker 3>especially an unbalanced elation when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hunting over bait,</v>

3138
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:44.743
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For an animal that is not necessarily </v>

3139
02:34:46.991 --> 02:34:50.680
<v Speaker 3>thought of in our culture as being an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal that you eat,</v>

3140
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:54.070
<v Speaker 3>which is bear and a lot of times people </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that you don't eat them.</v>

3141
02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:54.993
<v Speaker 3>Black bears in particular actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they taste very good and people do eat </v>

3142
02:34:57.311 --> 02:34:59.830
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you deal with people,</v>

3143
02:34:59.831 --> 02:35:03.190
<v Speaker 3>like I have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend John and Jen Rivet who live in</v>

3144
02:35:03.191 --> 02:35:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Alberta and there they are hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>guides.</v>

3145
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a real necessity up there to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>

3146
02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3147
02:35:09.310 --> 02:35:10.143
<v Speaker 3>Because there is nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's keeping their populations in check </v>

3148
02:35:11.951 --> 02:35:12.784
<v Speaker 3>and if you ever go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see an extraordinary amount of </v>

3149
02:35:15.551 --> 02:35:17.410
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could see 19,</v>

3150
02:35:17.411 --> 02:35:18.244
<v Speaker 3>20 bears in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they're everywhere and there's a </v>

3151
02:35:20.351 --> 02:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>high density of them and they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>decimate the deer population.</v>

3152
02:35:24.101 --> 02:35:24.934
<v Speaker 3>They decimate the Moose population and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some of them that learn that </v>

3153
02:35:28.631 --> 02:35:29.464
<v Speaker 3>they can get into garbage cans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can break into people's cars and </v>

3154
02:35:31.961 --> 02:35:33.970
<v Speaker 3>destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've killed a few people,</v>

3155
02:35:33.971 --> 02:35:34.804
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time they realized that </v>

3156
02:35:36.431 --> 02:35:38.140
<v Speaker 3>people are dangerous and they stay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck away,</v>

3157
02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:39.963
<v Speaker 3>but it's not what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I appreciate his spot and stocking </v>

3158
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:48.040
<v Speaker 3>traditional prey animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like to do.</v>

3159
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I like to spot and stalk deer and elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I feel like first of all,</v>

3160
02:35:53.381 --> 02:35:58.060
<v Speaker 3>they're the most delicious they make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it makes sense or not,</v>

3161
02:35:58.061 --> 02:36:01.630
<v Speaker 3>they make the most sense to me in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like a prey animal.</v>

3162
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:02.463
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones that I covet the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I want to do is I want to go and </v>

3163
02:36:06.041 --> 02:36:09.910
<v Speaker 3>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mature animals that are undulates.</v>

3164
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's a deer or an elk or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal that has spread its genetics that</v>

3165
02:36:14.561 --> 02:36:15.940
<v Speaker 3>has already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3166
02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:16.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

3167
02:36:16.721 --> 02:36:17.554
<v Speaker 3>eight years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine years old as animal that doesn't </v>

3168
02:36:19.391 --> 02:36:21.280
<v Speaker 3>have much time left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get it now,</v>

3169
02:36:21.430 --> 02:36:23.920
<v Speaker 3>you're probably getting it within a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>of its death.</v>

3170
02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's by natural causes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves,</v>

3171
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:27.880
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starvation,</v>

3172
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:31.930
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing it probably the most humane</v>

3173
02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you're giving it probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>humane death.</v>

3174
02:36:33.701 --> 02:36:37.570
<v Speaker 3>It's reasonably possible for this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is unless it falls off a cliff,</v>

3175
02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:38.913
<v Speaker 3>and even then it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might survive that for a little </v>

3176
02:36:41.861 --> 02:36:42.694
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're shooting an animal with an </v>

3177
02:36:43.721 --> 02:36:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dead in seconds.</v>

3178
02:36:45.770 --> 02:36:49.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit it in the heart and they shot an</v>

3179
02:36:49.391 --> 02:36:50.224
<v Speaker 3>elk this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It literally walked four yards and </v>

3180
02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:54.040
<v Speaker 3>tipped over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just step,</v>

3181
02:36:54.041 --> 02:36:55.030
<v Speaker 3>step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>step,</v>

3182
02:36:55.031 --> 02:36:55.864
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very impressed with the skill of </v>

3183
02:36:58.121 --> 02:36:58.954
<v Speaker 3>some of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is the print primitive </v>

3184
02:37:00.851 --> 02:37:03.670
<v Speaker 3>hunting movement with spears and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3185
02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:07.893
<v Speaker 3>I think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be really careful </v>

3186
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:15.130
<v Speaker 3>about anything that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not that accurate.</v>

3187
02:37:15.170 --> 02:37:16.003
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

3188
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.070
<v Speaker 2>an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3189
02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aba bowser extremely accurate,</v>

3190
02:37:20.301 --> 02:37:21.134
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's guys that can shoot a </v>

3191
02:37:23.061 --> 02:37:26.330
<v Speaker 2>paper plate at 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 yards every single time.</v>

3192
02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:29.360
<v Speaker 2>They could shoot a a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little plate like that.</v>

3193
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:30.523
<v Speaker 2>They'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll bet their life that could drop </v>

3194
02:37:31.851 --> 02:37:34.550
<v Speaker 2>an Arrow into that at 120 yards every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single time.</v>

3195
02:37:34.551 --> 02:37:35.384
<v Speaker 2>You can get good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get if you have good technique </v>

3196
02:37:37.791 --> 02:37:41.780
<v Speaker 2>and reasonable control of your emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your anxiety in the heart,</v>

3197
02:37:41.781 --> 02:37:42.614
<v Speaker 2>in the heat of the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't ever shoot anything in 120 </v>

3198
02:37:44.571 --> 02:37:46.700
<v Speaker 2>yards though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shooting at things 30 yards,</v>

3199
02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:51.730
<v Speaker 2>40 yards and the degree of success is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very high with skilled hunters.</v>

3200
02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:55.820
<v Speaker 2>If you are ethical and the shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're shot decisions.</v>

3201
02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:58.190
<v Speaker 2>That primitive stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3202
02:37:58.191 --> 02:38:00.620
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you throwing spears like,</v>

3203
02:38:00.621 --> 02:38:01.454
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to prove that you're </v>

3204
02:38:02.841 --> 02:38:04.610
<v Speaker 2>better than people that use a bow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow,</v>

3205
02:38:04.611 --> 02:38:07.550
<v Speaker 2>like this is not an accurate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective thing.</v>

3206
02:38:07.850 --> 02:38:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean it kind of is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be like five yards,</v>

3207
02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:13.550
<v Speaker 2>10 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you got to be 15 yards Max.</v>

3208
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:14.503
<v Speaker 2>Even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the thrill of it for </v>

3209
02:38:15.561 --> 02:38:18.890
<v Speaker 2>them is putting themselves in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of that.</v>

3210
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.870
<v Speaker 2>If you're shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3211
02:38:20.890 --> 02:38:22.730
<v Speaker 2>you're going after a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3212
02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:23.913
<v Speaker 2>Like I've seen some of these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmed where the person looks like </v>

3213
02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:29.090
<v Speaker 2>they're up in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to call it,</v>

3214
02:38:29.091 --> 02:38:29.924
<v Speaker 2>their little treestand Tristan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't look like they're </v>

3215
02:38:34.191 --> 02:38:35.024
<v Speaker 2>putting a lot of risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of these people are clearly </v>

3216
02:38:36.771 --> 02:38:40.100
<v Speaker 2>getting off on this is the primal hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3217
02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:40.993
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going backwards into something </v>

3218
02:38:44.331 --> 02:38:49.070
<v Speaker 2>where the animal could surprise them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I.</v>

3219
02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:52.820
<v Speaker 2>What I wanted to do is I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reacquaint myself with,</v>

3220
02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I can,</v>

3221
02:38:54.470 --> 02:38:55.550
<v Speaker 2>I can watch somebody.</v>

3222
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that moment,</v>

3223
02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out what my ethics </v>
<v Speaker 2>around hunting were and I thought that I</v>

3224
02:39:01.521 --> 02:39:04.590
<v Speaker 2>had prepared myself and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought when I,</v>

3225
02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:06.060
<v Speaker 2>when I saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3226
02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.550
<v Speaker 2>find out where joe is because I have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

3227
02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:11.713
<v Speaker 2>Knowing your ethics and how you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would have a very subtle </v>

3228
02:39:15.651 --> 02:39:17.990
<v Speaker 2>perspective on all these different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of kills.</v>

3229
02:39:17.991 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Which sorts of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3230
02:39:20.061 --> 02:39:23.750
<v Speaker 2>If you get to spears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a weird place.</v>

3231
02:39:24.490 --> 02:39:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>

3232
02:39:25.971 --> 02:39:27.590
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only spear wild pigs.</v>

3233
02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:29.480
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get rid of many way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3234
02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:30.593
<v Speaker 2>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a weird place where in a weird </v>

3235
02:39:32.421 --> 02:39:35.420
<v Speaker 2>place because ethically I think you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>two choices.</v>

3236
02:39:35.421 --> 02:39:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Three choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your three choices are rifle,</v>

3237
02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:41.810
<v Speaker 2>which is number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically realistically,</v>

3238
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:44.510
<v Speaker 2>because if you shoot something with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rifle,</v>

3239
02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be really accurate,</v>

3240
02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:48.283
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like out to 100 yards a hundred percent </v>

3241
02:39:50.721 --> 02:39:51.554
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like unless it's crazy windy out or </v>

3242
02:39:53.721 --> 02:39:54.554
<v Speaker 2>there's some weird conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>altitude can affect ballistics but not </v>

3243
02:39:58.581 --> 02:40:02.090
<v Speaker 2>that much out to 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking deadly.</v>

3244
02:40:02.091 --> 02:40:04.330
<v Speaker 2>If you have a really good control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeezing,</v>

3245
02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:05.203
<v Speaker 2>squeezing the trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not jerking everything and not </v>

3246
02:40:06.621 --> 02:40:09.530
<v Speaker 2>panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Beau is second,</v>

3247
02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:10.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow.</v>

3248
02:40:10.881 --> 02:40:14.250
<v Speaker 2>It requires way more practice way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more,</v>

3249
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:18.240
<v Speaker 3>a fine tuning of your motor skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still possible.</v>

3250
02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have crossbow,</v>

3251
02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:22.950
<v Speaker 3>which is even more effective than a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>

3252
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:24.293
<v Speaker 3>more feet per second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster feet per second so that it </v>

3253
02:40:26.311 --> 02:40:29.490
<v Speaker 3>travels at a flat line because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going quicker before it drops.</v>

3254
02:40:29.491 --> 02:40:31.260
<v Speaker 3>They all drop at the same speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3255
02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Bullets and arrows all drop at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed.</v>

3256
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:36.510
<v Speaker 3>They just don't get there at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed,</v>

3257
02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:37.593
<v Speaker 3>so the same amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm shooting something at a </v>

3258
02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:43.860
<v Speaker 3>hundred yards with a bow I am aiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

3259
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:44.743
<v Speaker 3>with a site that is calculating for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that the Arrow is going to drop </v>

3260
02:40:48.361 --> 02:40:49.194
<v Speaker 3>significantly in the time that it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's going 280 feet per second is </v>

3261
02:40:55.021 --> 02:40:59.490
<v Speaker 3>like a normal speed for a good bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good heavy Arrow that's 280 feet per</v>

3262
02:40:59.491 --> 02:41:00.324
<v Speaker 3>second that goes a hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bullet is going to go 100 yards far </v>

3263
02:41:04.771 --> 02:41:05.604
<v Speaker 3>quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the same amount of time it takes </v>

3264
02:41:07.531 --> 02:41:09.030
<v Speaker 3>that Arrow to get to that target.</v>

3265
02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:12.120
<v Speaker 3>The bullet is going to drop the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount as the Arrow and that's what most</v>

3266
02:41:12.121 --> 02:41:12.954
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so across crossbow is more ethical </v>

3267
02:41:16.770 --> 02:41:20.880
<v Speaker 3>because it's more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's have fewer moving parts.</v>

3268
02:41:20.881 --> 02:41:21.714
<v Speaker 3>You could actually sit it on a rest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just squeeze the trigger easier to </v>

3269
02:41:24.661 --> 02:41:25.494
<v Speaker 3>manipulate and the the Arrow is </v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling faster so it's called a bolt </v>

3270
02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:29.753
<v Speaker 3>traveling faster so it'll drop less </v>
<v Speaker 3>after that chick gets squirrely after </v>

3271
02:41:35.011 --> 02:41:36.510
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're throwing spears.</v>

3272
02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got what do you got?</v>

3273
02:41:37.621 --> 02:41:39.030
<v Speaker 3>An adult adol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3274
02:41:39.090 --> 02:41:39.923
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you can kill things with it and </v>

3275
02:41:41.821 --> 02:41:43.590
<v Speaker 3>people have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gets to.</v>

3276
02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:46.330
<v Speaker 3>How accurate are you and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is.</v>

3277
02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:47.183
<v Speaker 3>What's your ethical brain like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An ethical range for a really good </v>

3278
02:41:49.531 --> 02:41:52.290
<v Speaker 3>hunter with a bow and arrow is probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>80 yards.</v>

3279
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may be.</v>

3280
02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a moose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 yards,</v>

3281
02:41:55.111 --> 02:41:59.010
<v Speaker 3>something big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with a spear like what do you got?</v>

3282
02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:04.330
<v Speaker 3>You got 10 yards so you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>

3283
02:42:04.660 --> 02:42:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing it for meat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing it because,</v>

3284
02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:08.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this your Mount Everest?</v>

3285
02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:09.593
<v Speaker 3>You want to kill a pig with a spear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Are you saying that a pig is not </v>

3286
02:42:13.081 --> 02:42:13.914
<v Speaker 3>worth as much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you should be able to kill it with a </v>

3287
02:42:14.851 --> 02:42:17.580
<v Speaker 3>spear because these are all weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird decision.</v>

3288
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Just that weird decisions and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>make those with bears.</v>

3289
02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:23.130
<v Speaker 3>They make those decisions with black </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears,</v>

3290
02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:26.070
<v Speaker 3>like people that live where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider them nuisances.</v>

3291
02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:27.090
<v Speaker 3>Th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3292
02:42:27.090 --> 02:42:27.923
<v Speaker 3>they killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they used to be used to allow </v>

3293
02:42:29.610 --> 02:42:32.400
<v Speaker 3>them to shoot a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still allowed to hunt,</v>

3294
02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:37.040
<v Speaker 3>used to be allowed to hunt black bears </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a spear in Alberta until uh,</v>

3295
02:42:37.041 --> 02:42:42.041
<v Speaker 3>a big scandal a couple of years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>where a guy filmed himself doing that.</v>

3296
02:42:42.721 --> 02:42:45.510
<v Speaker 3>He shot a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He killed a bear rather with a spear and</v>

3297
02:42:45.511 --> 02:42:46.344
<v Speaker 3>was hooting and hollering and people got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hold of the video and thought it was </v>

3298
02:42:49.651 --> 02:42:51.990
<v Speaker 3>disgusting and protested it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3299
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:53.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3300
02:42:53.011 --> 02:42:56.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from underarmour dropped his,</v>

3301
02:42:56.091 --> 02:42:57.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife from there,</v>

3302
02:42:57.980 --> 02:42:58.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had this sort of sponsorship deal </v>

3303
02:43:00.571 --> 02:43:02.770
<v Speaker 3>with them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3304
02:43:02.780 --> 02:43:04.190
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ignited,</v>

3305
02:43:04.191 --> 02:43:06.150
<v Speaker 3>it caused a rift in the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

3306
02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Some people think you should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt with a rock here,</v>

3307
02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:11.120
<v Speaker 3>what you hunt with Sheila Hunt with </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and other people like,</v>

3308
02:43:11.430 --> 02:43:12.490
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3309
02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:16.900
<v Speaker 3>but what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we just going out to get meat or are</v>

3310
02:43:16.901 --> 02:43:19.730
<v Speaker 3>we putting on a macho performance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>

3311
02:43:19.850 --> 02:43:22.280
<v Speaker 2>But this is exactly what I wanted to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

3312
02:43:22.281 --> 02:43:23.114
<v Speaker 2>which is if you know that the population</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be controlled and you want the </v>

3313
02:43:26.781 --> 02:43:27.830
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3314
02:43:28.430 --> 02:43:29.263
<v Speaker 2>then it makes sense to me that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to open yourself up to some of the </v>

3315
02:43:31.611 --> 02:43:33.830
<v Speaker 2>pleasure of the kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes some sense.</v>

3316
02:43:34.370 --> 02:43:38.760
<v Speaker 2>But what I saw just like flipped me out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if it wasn't a,</v>

3317
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:40.520
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was above and beyond.</v>

3318
02:43:40.521 --> 02:43:41.354
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw spirit and other things and you </v>

3319
02:43:43.851 --> 02:43:44.960
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was impressed by the,</v>

3320
02:43:44.961 --> 02:43:47.360
<v Speaker 2>some of the skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed by some of the bravery,</v>

3321
02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:52.280
<v Speaker 2>but like why doing it to population </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

3322
02:43:52.281 --> 02:43:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it for the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a surprise to me is that I got,</v>

3323
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I got kind of sickened by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not surprising.</v>

3324
02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:00.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3325
02:44:00.261 --> 02:44:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you,</v>

3326
02:44:02.970 --> 02:44:03.803
<v Speaker 3>if you were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably be even more conflicted </v>

3327
02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:08.520
<v Speaker 3>because you actually were there in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presence of the thing.</v>

3328
02:44:08.521 --> 02:44:13.170
<v Speaker 3>Dying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching bare die on video is one thing.</v>

3329
02:44:13.171 --> 02:44:15.840
<v Speaker 3>But being there alive when they die as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different thing,</v>

3330
02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:18.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3331
02:44:19.930 --> 02:44:23.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated thing because we</v>

3332
02:44:23.321 --> 02:44:24.820
<v Speaker 2>have these deep set</v>

3333
02:44:26.530 --> 02:44:31.060
<v Speaker 3>emotional connections to certain animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my friend Steve Rinella,</v>

3334
02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:36.000
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be actually on tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he calls them charismatic megafauna that</v>

3335
02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:40.000
<v Speaker 3>we have this different view of certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals bears in particular.</v>

3336
02:44:41.020 --> 02:44:44.260
<v Speaker 3>But if you use the animal respectfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respectfully,</v>

3337
02:44:44.261 --> 02:44:45.094
<v Speaker 3>and you kill it ethically and you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any problem with hunting </v>

3338
02:44:47.861 --> 02:44:48.790
<v Speaker 3>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3339
02:44:48.791 --> 02:44:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is a necessary task.</v>

3340
02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:56.230
<v Speaker 3>It it's something that even if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to hunt bears,</v>

3341
02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.510
<v Speaker 3>if you're living in a place like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alberta,</v>

3342
02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:01.390
<v Speaker 3>you probably should hunt bears because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do your part.</v>

3343
02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:03.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them out there and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3344
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.903
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that becomes an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting relationship is a </v>

3345
02:45:07.031 --> 02:45:07.864
<v Speaker 3>relationship between the moose hunters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the deer hunters and the bear </v>

3346
02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:15.340
<v Speaker 3>hunters that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of those smart ones have come to an</v>

3347
02:45:15.341 --> 02:45:17.350
<v Speaker 3>understanding that even if I don't hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>

3348
02:45:17.351 --> 02:45:18.184
<v Speaker 3>I need those people out there doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's how do you do it and why you </v>

3349
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.863
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've seen animals die very </v>

3350
02:45:25.841 --> 02:45:27.790
<v Speaker 3>quickly with the bone marrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They die very quickly.</v>

3351
02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen an animal die with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spear.</v>

3352
02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:31.143
<v Speaker 3>Don't think it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to be the person that </v>

3353
02:45:33.281 --> 02:45:34.114
<v Speaker 3>tells you you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have an ethical range of five </v>

3354
02:45:36.820 --> 02:45:37.653
<v Speaker 3>yards and you only hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear with a spear at five yards and you </v>

3355
02:45:41.171 --> 02:45:43.150
<v Speaker 3>kill it immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hit it and kill it.</v>

3356
02:45:43.810 --> 02:45:46.870
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're right based on the method.</v>

3357
02:45:46.871 --> 02:45:50.470
<v Speaker 2>It's based on what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the ethical parameters around.</v>

3358
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

3359
02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:52.713
<v Speaker 3>I would kind of be a hypocrite because </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I can ethically kill </v>

3360
02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:58.900
<v Speaker 3>something at 40 yards or just figuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>out what the number is,</v>

3361
02:45:58.901 --> 02:46:00.660
<v Speaker 3>depending on the size of the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3362
02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I can do that,</v>

3363
02:46:03.191 --> 02:46:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I can do it way easier with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why am I using a bow and Arrow?</v>

3364
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:09.950
<v Speaker 3>Why do I want to make it more difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I making it more challenging?</v>

3365
02:46:09.951 --> 02:46:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Why am I requiring myself to practice</v>

3366
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:14.780
<v Speaker 2>this questions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very self aware.</v>

3367
02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:15.673
<v Speaker 2>It's a very important question to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I was just doing it just for </v>

3368
02:46:18.651 --> 02:46:20.990
<v Speaker 2>the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would probably use a rifle,</v>

3369
02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:21.853
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3370
02:46:22.310 --> 02:46:23.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

3371
02:46:23.091 --> 02:46:23.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3372
02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:27.050
<v Speaker 2>that part of it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primal association with the kill.</v>

3373
02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And then the key question is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to indulge that?</v>

3374
02:46:29.601 --> 02:46:30.920
<v Speaker 2>What is the set and setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

3375
02:46:30.921 --> 02:46:31.311
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

3376
02:46:31.311 --> 02:46:34.040
<v Speaker 2>So that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing that I found shocking</v>

3377
02:46:34.041 --> 02:46:36.200
<v Speaker 2>is that I had thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3378
02:46:36.201 --> 02:46:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I understood something about the need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control population.</v>

3379
02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:42.590
<v Speaker 2>It's the effect which really killed me </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this thing.</v>

3380
02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3381
02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:45.080
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3382
02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:47.810
<v Speaker 2>as such as bears and other animals as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

3383
02:46:47.850 --> 02:46:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I saw.</v>

3384
02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to focus more on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>

3385
02:46:54.861 --> 02:46:57.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a question I had to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because I sort of.</v>

3386
02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I was very surprised by my own reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3387
02:47:00.321 --> 02:47:03.080
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are taking issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My good friend Ben,</v>

3388
02:47:03.081 --> 02:47:05.570
<v Speaker 2>oh Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a brilliant writer,</v>

3389
02:47:05.571 --> 02:47:08.780
<v Speaker 2>who's actually also a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

3390
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:13.350
<v Speaker 3>advocating that people stopped taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he calls grip and grins with a grip</v>

3391
02:47:13.351 --> 02:47:15.330
<v Speaker 3>and grin as like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you shot a beautiful deer,</v>

3392
02:47:15.331 --> 02:47:16.164
<v Speaker 3>you're holding the deer up by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>antlers and you're smiling and he's </v>

3393
02:47:18.721 --> 02:47:19.554
<v Speaker 3>advocating that those photos are </v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic because people who don't </v>

3394
02:47:21.961 --> 02:47:24.930
<v Speaker 3>hunt look at it like you're some blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>thirsty asshole.</v>

3395
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:28.470
<v Speaker 3>That's super happy that something died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not.</v>

3396
02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Even though that's not how the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel when they're taking those photos,</v>

3397
02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:36.720
<v Speaker 3>what there are as happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That something which is very difficult,</v>

3398
02:47:36.721 --> 02:47:38.370
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with using a bow.</v>

3399
02:47:38.580 --> 02:47:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Most people go home empty handed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's it requires too much fitness,</v>

3400
02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:43.793
<v Speaker 3>physical fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're going up and down these </v>

3401
02:47:45.001 --> 02:47:49.980
<v Speaker 3>mountains and requires too much accuracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and training and technique and archery.</v>

3402
02:47:49.981 --> 02:47:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Most people fuck it up and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with anxiety.</v>

3403
02:47:52.171 --> 02:47:53.004
<v Speaker 3>Most people fuck it up,</v>

3404
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:54.663
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

3405
02:47:55.290 --> 02:47:59.280
<v Speaker 3>after it's all over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this great feeling of elation.</v>

3406
02:47:59.340 --> 02:48:00.121
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>

3407
02:48:00.121 --> 02:48:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it came together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3408
02:48:01.801 --> 02:48:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Because it was probably not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come together and people get happy.</v>

3409
02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:07.560
<v Speaker 3>These are people again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that already accept hunting.</v>

3410
02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:08.573
<v Speaker 3>Now if you take someone who is an animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights activist or someone who deeply </v>

3411
02:48:11.221 --> 02:48:13.320
<v Speaker 3>appreciates animals and then you show </v>
<v Speaker 3>them that photo,</v>

3412
02:48:13.620 --> 02:48:16.800
<v Speaker 3>they have a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>association with what that photo means.</v>

3413
02:48:16.801 --> 02:48:20.220
<v Speaker 3>What that photo means is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an asshole who's a trophy hunter.</v>

3414
02:48:21.230 --> 02:48:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Let me get my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any species that celebrates</v>

3415
02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:32.930
<v Speaker 2>a kill for food with glee chips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do chosen.</v>

3416
02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:33.793
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3417
02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:35.030
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3418
02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:36.610
<v Speaker 2>When they kill a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get pretty happy.</v>

3419
02:48:36.611 --> 02:48:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Well then they do it socially and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they share it.</v>

3420
02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:40.463
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3421
02:48:40.490 --> 02:48:43.290
<v Speaker 2>through altruism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they scream at each other in a.</v>

3422
02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:46.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's the ships are my least </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite species.</v>

3423
02:48:46.371 --> 02:48:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Almost evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrifying.</v>

3424
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It terrifying little fuckers.</v>

3425
02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:53.353
<v Speaker 2>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think we are on the </v>

3426
02:48:54.351 --> 02:48:56.060
<v Speaker 2>political front?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't even touched that.</v>

3427
02:48:56.390 --> 02:48:57.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same way as bowhunting </v>

3428
02:49:00.051 --> 02:49:03.330
<v Speaker 2>versus spears rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

3429
02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:05.420
<v Speaker 2>there's this world's messy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3430
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:07.930
<v Speaker 2>all these things are messy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see a way in which this</v>

3431
02:49:08.370 --> 02:49:09.203
<v Speaker 3>political epic comes to an end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only hope that I have is through </v>

3432
02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:20.180
<v Speaker 3>reasonable dialog becoming an accepted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and appreciated thing,</v>

3433
02:49:21.031 --> 02:49:21.864
<v Speaker 3>a celebrated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that this is possible that people </v>

3434
02:49:24.181 --> 02:49:25.014
<v Speaker 3>can realize that there's some stupidity </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this team mentality that we have is </v>

3435
02:49:29.461 --> 02:49:33.300
<v Speaker 3>right versus left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is almost all a good percentage of</v>

3436
02:49:33.301 --> 02:49:36.210
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's assumed identities,</v>

3437
02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:36.871
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

3438
02:49:36.871 --> 02:49:37.704
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these predetermined patterns that get </v>

3439
02:49:40.081 --> 02:49:43.500
<v Speaker 3>adopted in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we first started talking about this,</v>

3440
02:49:43.570 --> 02:49:46.860
<v Speaker 3>in order to establish yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's in a group,</v>

3441
02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:51.120
<v Speaker 3>you get accepted by this group and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it left and right.</v>

3442
02:49:51.121 --> 02:49:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to name any names,</v>

3443
02:49:52.441 --> 02:49:54.120
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of people that do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>blatantly.</v>

3444
02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:55.193
<v Speaker 3>You see them and I've even seen them </v>
<v Speaker 3>switched teams and you see them switch </v>

3445
02:49:57.901 --> 02:50:00.840
<v Speaker 3>teams and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy the rationalizations when it</v>

3446
02:50:00.841 --> 02:50:01.674
<v Speaker 3>comes to ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think is what they're doing is </v>

3447
02:50:02.851 --> 02:50:06.480
<v Speaker 3>they're switching teams because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized there's an end on this team and</v>

3448
02:50:06.481 --> 02:50:08.370
<v Speaker 3>they can just say this is the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the team.</v>

3449
02:50:08.370 --> 02:50:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I used to be on those fucking losers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really benedict arnold,</v>

3450
02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:13.133
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they probably have as much of an </v>

3451
02:50:16.051 --> 02:50:19.050
<v Speaker 3>affinity to the ideas of one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it do the other side.</v>

3452
02:50:19.290 --> 02:50:22.530
<v Speaker 3>They just go all in on one side to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptance from the group.</v>

3453
02:50:23.130 --> 02:50:23.963
<v Speaker 3>You just no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People change their opinion that much </v>

3454
02:50:25.561 --> 02:50:26.394
<v Speaker 3>over two years or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they just decide this group makes </v>

3455
02:50:29.791 --> 02:50:33.060
<v Speaker 3>more sense now and I've been attacked by</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the left so I'm going to go to</v>

3456
02:50:33.061 --> 02:50:37.440
<v Speaker 3>the right or vice verse and usually what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is is when even when they say they've</v>

3457
02:50:37.470 --> 02:50:38.161
<v Speaker 3>been attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3458
02:50:38.161 --> 02:50:38.994
<v Speaker 3>oh you fucking baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 300 million people just in this </v>

3459
02:50:42.061 --> 02:50:42.894
<v Speaker 3>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you put something out there publicly </v>

3460
02:50:45.210 --> 02:50:46.043
<v Speaker 3>and a thousand people attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't act like you're being </v>

3461
02:50:47.911 --> 02:50:48.840
<v Speaker 3>persecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

3462
02:50:48.841 --> 02:50:50.220
<v Speaker 3>You have an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

3463
02:50:50.250 --> 02:50:51.083
<v Speaker 3>you've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've launched that idea out into the </v>

3464
02:50:53.071 --> 02:50:55.350
<v Speaker 3>zeitgeists and people took a big shit on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3465
02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:56.453
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's people on the right are </v>

3466
02:50:57.181 --> 02:50:58.014
<v Speaker 3>people on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to argue your point </v>

3467
02:50:59.491 --> 02:51:00.324
<v Speaker 3>one way or the other and not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately jumped ship on someone who </v>

3468
02:51:02.971 --> 02:51:03.804
<v Speaker 3>shares ideas with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decides that your idea sucks and maybe </v>

3469
02:51:07.351 --> 02:51:10.830
<v Speaker 3>they're wrong and maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to argue that through,</v>

3470
02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:11.753
<v Speaker 3>but this idea of these partisan patterns</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people just seem to automatically </v>

3471
02:51:16.951 --> 02:51:20.200
<v Speaker 3>fall into there is so detrimental to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue there,</v>

3472
02:51:20.220 --> 02:51:21.053
<v Speaker 3>so detrimental to us under really </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding each other and really </v>

3473
02:51:23.671 --> 02:51:25.980
<v Speaker 3>having some sort of a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

3474
02:51:25.981 --> 02:51:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a giant community of 300 million</v>

3475
02:51:28.831 --> 02:51:30.870
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's supposed to be and this</v>

3476
02:51:30.871 --> 02:51:34.230
<v Speaker 3>idea that it's this group is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it up and they're trying to turn us</v>

3477
02:51:34.231 --> 02:51:35.064
<v Speaker 3>all Muslims and this one wants everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be gay and this one wants everybody </v>

3478
02:51:38.071 --> 02:51:40.240
<v Speaker 3>to fucking have free food and this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3479
02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:42.120
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>

3480
02:51:42.270 --> 02:51:46.350
<v Speaker 3>We need better understanding and and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know the word better.</v>

3481
02:51:46.351 --> 02:51:47.184
<v Speaker 3>Education gets tossed around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also means better social </v>

3482
02:51:49.801 --> 02:51:52.680
<v Speaker 3>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better social education.</v>

3483
02:51:52.830 --> 02:51:53.663
<v Speaker 3>I got at appreciation of who we are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>why we think the way we think and </v>

3484
02:51:56.941 --> 02:52:00.060
<v Speaker 3>calling out weasels on both sides of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern,</v>

3485
02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:03.450
<v Speaker 3>like calling out weasels on the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are pandering,</v>

3486
02:52:03.451 --> 02:52:04.284
<v Speaker 3>that are just trying to get unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the repeating a lot of these like </v>

3487
02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:10.660
<v Speaker 3>accepted beliefs because they know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can hit this frequency and a lot of</v>

3488
02:52:10.661 --> 02:52:13.990
<v Speaker 3>people sing along or the same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people are doing on the left.</v>

3489
02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:15.033
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most reasonable people have a </v>

3490
02:52:18.581 --> 02:52:19.414
<v Speaker 3>collection of ideas that they share from</v>
<v Speaker 3>both the right and the left and most </v>

3491
02:52:22.691 --> 02:52:23.524
<v Speaker 3>reasonable people are reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate and I think that's one of </v>

3492
02:52:27.731 --> 02:52:32.731
<v Speaker 3>the things that we're missing some </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable sense of not just ethics,</v>

3493
02:52:34.030 --> 02:52:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but an appreciation for each other for </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us as a group and do that.</v>

3494
02:52:41.350 --> 02:52:42.183
<v Speaker 3>I think if we can celebrate reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations and celebrate and </v>

3495
02:52:46.631 --> 02:52:48.460
<v Speaker 3>understanding of other people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspectives,</v>

3496
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:51.760
<v Speaker 3>be able to just look at how you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at things and have empathy.</v>

3497
02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see where you're coming from with</v>

3498
02:52:53.891 --> 02:52:54.581
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3499
02:52:54.581 --> 02:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Let me put myself in your shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3500
02:52:56.321 --> 02:52:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Instead of just immediately like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

3501
02:52:58.331 --> 02:53:00.800
<v Speaker 3>you cook and fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you this.</v>

3502
02:53:00.801 --> 02:53:03.100
<v Speaker 3>And instead of thinking about it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3503
02:53:03.250 --> 02:53:04.083
<v Speaker 3>if we just tried to just everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise a little bit more so we're a </v>

3504
02:53:08.231 --> 02:53:09.064
<v Speaker 3>little bit more calm and come at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a rational place and try to like </v>

3505
02:53:13.151 --> 02:53:13.984
<v Speaker 3>realize like it's</v>

3506
02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:15.533
<v Speaker 1>exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been experimenting with a very </v>

3507
02:53:18.031 --> 02:53:20.040
<v Speaker 1>dangerous idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing,</v>

3508
02:53:20.050 --> 02:53:20.883
<v Speaker 1>but chief inclusion officers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about things from </v>

3509
02:53:26.470 --> 02:53:30.210
<v Speaker 1>ecclesiasticus to every season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a purpose under heaven.</v>

3510
02:53:30.211 --> 02:53:31.044
<v Speaker 1>So if there's inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there also has to be exclusion and like </v>

3511
02:53:35.130 --> 02:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>d platforming or unplanned forming </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is an act of exclusion.</v>

3512
02:53:38.701 --> 02:53:39.534
<v Speaker 1>And very often it's very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people who are for inclusion </v>

3513
02:53:41.581 --> 02:53:43.890
<v Speaker 1>are very focused on the need for deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>platforming,</v>

3514
02:53:43.891 --> 02:53:44.724
<v Speaker 1>which is an act of exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So should we have chief exclusion </v>

3515
02:53:47.701 --> 02:53:52.110
<v Speaker 1>officers that both monitor who is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>excluded,</v>

3516
02:53:52.111 --> 02:53:55.000
<v Speaker 1>including somebody like James Demore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3517
02:53:55.050 --> 02:53:59.280
<v Speaker 1>at Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is it ethical to exclude him or are</v>

3518
02:53:59.281 --> 02:54:03.660
<v Speaker 1>there certain voices that need to not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some tables in order for something to</v>

3519
02:54:03.661 --> 02:54:04.494
<v Speaker 1>make progress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you always have the voice </v>

3520
02:54:06.901 --> 02:54:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that the most extreme that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the game,</v>

3521
02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:10.913
<v Speaker 1>then it's very hard to move forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the game if you're constantly </v>

3522
02:54:13.171 --> 02:54:14.820
<v Speaker 1>being reminded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3523
02:54:14.820 --> 02:54:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So we had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3524
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:22.670
<v Speaker 1>we have a series of situations in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like some perspective that very</v>

3525
02:54:23.491 --> 02:54:24.324
<v Speaker 1>few people hold terrorizes majority's or</v>
<v Speaker 1>know group of people who sort of can </v>

3526
02:54:30.061 --> 02:54:30.894
<v Speaker 1>more or less get along with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keeps pushing us into this very </v>

3527
02:54:34.741 --> 02:54:37.140
<v Speaker 1>divided landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just curious,</v>

3528
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of our group of people that we,</v>

3529
02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:44.280
<v Speaker 1>we talk and hang out with a in common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3530
02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:47.500
<v Speaker 1>where you see the high leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3531
02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:50.060
<v Speaker 1>is that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've just finished the midterm.</v>

3532
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:51.660
<v Speaker 1>We've got this 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 election.</v>

3533
02:54:51.690 --> 02:54:52.523
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me like Hillary is Kinda I </v>
<v Speaker 1>in whether she wants to get back in the </v>

3534
02:54:56.131 --> 02:54:57.670
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3535
02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:00.540
<v Speaker 1>this trump thing has completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3536
02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:01.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3537
02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:04.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like the dress is it black and blue</v>

3538
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:04.843
<v Speaker 3>or white and gold for like eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just have you thought about how </v>

3539
02:55:12.081 --> 02:55:14.690
<v Speaker 3>this ends?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3540
02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:15.613
<v Speaker 3>I would never be so presumptuous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that I have any idea how this </v>

3541
02:55:19.451 --> 02:55:20.620
<v Speaker 3>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

3542
02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:25.660
<v Speaker 3>I've proposed various scenarios to </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and I don't like any of them.</v>

3543
02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't like where it's going because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I worry about,</v>

3544
02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:30.073
<v Speaker 3>and this is also again hypocritical that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think it probably should burn </v>

3545
02:55:35.031 --> 02:55:39.640
<v Speaker 3>down and be rebuilt from the ruins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were not going to get such a clear thing</v>

3546
02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:40.733
<v Speaker 3>to be clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this isn't very clean either </v>

3547
02:55:42.831 --> 02:55:43.790
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

3548
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:45.920
<v Speaker 3>It's that guy won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not clean.</v>

3549
02:55:47.150 --> 02:55:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves Putin.</v>

3550
02:55:49.250 --> 02:55:50.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ain't clean.</v>

3551
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:51.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is weird.</v>

3552
02:55:51.771 --> 02:55:52.604
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bankers having the amount of </v>

3553
02:55:53.931 --> 02:55:56.390
<v Speaker 3>influence they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that there's two lobbyists.</v>

3554
02:55:56.391 --> 02:55:57.224
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the number like two lobbyists to </v>

3555
02:55:59.151 --> 02:55:59.984
<v Speaker 3>every member of Congress or to lobbyists</v>
<v Speaker 3>to every senator for the pharmaceutical </v>

3556
02:56:04.581 --> 02:56:05.330
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

3557
02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:08.390
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of people that have influence</v>

3558
02:56:08.391 --> 02:56:10.640
<v Speaker 3>over the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our laws are shaped.</v>

3559
02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:13.220
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking bananas right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3560
02:56:13.221 --> 02:56:14.870
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so off the rails,</v>

3561
02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:17.390
<v Speaker 3>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve,</v>

3562
02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:18.313
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't type in specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a 23 registered lobbyists </v>

3563
02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:23.360
<v Speaker 3>for every member of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3564
02:56:23.361 --> 02:56:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I think from the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>

3565
02:56:25.281 --> 02:56:26.114
<v Speaker 3>they were saying not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's two for every member of </v>

3566
02:56:28.401 --> 02:56:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Congress in the pharmaceutical industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3567
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:32.623
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question that you started out with </v>

3568
02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:34.993
<v Speaker 3>like d platforming people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're impatient and I think </v>

3569
02:56:40.190 --> 02:56:41.420
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're.</v>

3570
02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:46.480
<v Speaker 3>We really want to make sure that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>vetting of ideas happens quickly because</v>

3571
02:56:48.291 --> 02:56:50.060
<v Speaker 3>we see the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3572
02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:53.900
<v Speaker 3>we see the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see that this is incorrect and we see</v>

3573
02:56:53.901 --> 02:56:55.270
<v Speaker 3>these people that think the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>flat,</v>

3574
02:56:55.271 --> 02:56:57.160
<v Speaker 3>are idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we think that these people that this</v>

3575
02:56:57.380 --> 02:57:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I think this and think that we think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all wrong and so we want to stop</v>

3576
02:57:00.681 --> 02:57:03.530
<v Speaker 3>them from talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't work.</v>

3577
02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:05.990
<v Speaker 3>It just works for now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

3578
02:57:05.991 --> 02:57:06.620
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3579
02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It oftentimes feeds those ideas and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>

3580
02:57:11.090 --> 02:57:14.140
<v Speaker 3>it it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to question like,</v>

3581
02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:19.420
<v Speaker 3>why are you so sure why you showed so </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that you are correct that you want.</v>

3582
02:57:20.570 --> 02:57:24.560
<v Speaker 3>You don't just want your side to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard exclusively.</v>

3583
02:57:24.561 --> 02:57:27.500
<v Speaker 3>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to silence these other people's</v>

3584
02:57:27.501 --> 02:57:31.040
<v Speaker 3>ability to participate in this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're totally wrong.</v>

3585
02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:32.833
<v Speaker 3>I think that's dangerous because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the way to fight off ideas that </v>

3586
02:57:37.731 --> 02:57:40.520
<v Speaker 3>aren't good is to introduce ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are good and you're gonna.</v>

3587
02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:43.010
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna have a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with ideas that are bad,</v>

3588
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:48.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think that that's a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole figuring things out,</v>

3589
02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:52.370
<v Speaker 3>like you need to have bad ideas floating</v>
<v Speaker 3>around there to appreciate good idea,</v>

3590
02:57:52.371 --> 02:57:55.610
<v Speaker 3>so if all the ideas are good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do we do get it out against.</v>

3591
02:57:56.060 --> 02:57:58.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad to have these bad ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast.</v>

3592
02:57:59.150 --> 02:58:00.890
<v Speaker 3>What's bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To not have someone,</v>

3593
02:58:01.380 --> 02:58:02.670
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are bad ideas,</v>

3594
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:05.250
<v Speaker 3>but I need to see the pitfalls of </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>

3595
02:58:05.251 --> 02:58:06.084
<v Speaker 3>We need to see the pitfalls of crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to see the pitfalls of </v>

3596
02:58:08.131 --> 02:58:10.080
<v Speaker 3>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to see it in action.</v>

3597
02:58:10.110 --> 02:58:12.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swindling.</v>

3598
02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:13.073
<v Speaker 3>I think in a lot of ways it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to understand that this is a </v>

3599
02:58:15.091 --> 02:58:15.924
<v Speaker 3>pattern that people fall into </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually over and over again when </v>

3600
02:58:18.061 --> 02:58:20.550
<v Speaker 3>they have control over the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have control over the way they</v>

3601
02:58:20.551 --> 02:58:22.290
<v Speaker 3>move the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I do this?</v>

3602
02:58:22.410 --> 02:58:23.243
<v Speaker 3>How about if I tell you that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go down and then you invest </v>

3603
02:58:24.691 --> 02:58:27.510
<v Speaker 3>some money and I put some money in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>bank and we work together.</v>

3604
02:58:27.660 --> 02:58:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's make some money because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do right,</v>

3605
02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:31.770
<v Speaker 3>if they just fucking do it over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over again,</v>

3606
02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:32.850
<v Speaker 3>should you punish them?</v>

3607
02:58:32.910 --> 02:58:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3608
02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:39.560
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's kind of important to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see some fucked up behavior just because</v>

3609
02:58:40.890 --> 02:58:41.723
<v Speaker 3>we're not done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still in some sort of emotional </v>

3610
02:58:44.701 --> 02:58:47.790
<v Speaker 3>and psychological and even physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>

3611
02:58:47.791 --> 02:58:48.624
<v Speaker 3>We're in the middle of this thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that bad ideas facilitate </v>

3612
02:58:52.651 --> 02:58:53.484
<v Speaker 3>comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these really shitty ideas that a </v>

3613
02:58:55.771 --> 02:58:56.604
<v Speaker 3>lot of people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they facilitate a </v>

3614
02:58:58.201 --> 02:58:59.034
<v Speaker 3>comprehension of why we think dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes you don't know why people </v>

3615
02:59:03.181 --> 02:59:04.014
<v Speaker 3>think dumb shit until you see someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again that thinks dumb </v>

3616
02:59:06.271 --> 02:59:07.104
<v Speaker 3>shit and you get to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Alex Jones or whether it's </v>

3617
02:59:09.211 --> 02:59:11.340
<v Speaker 3>to fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what guide you want deep,</v>

3618
02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:12.550
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3619
02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:15.750
<v Speaker 3>so here's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a lot of our leading experts,</v>

3620
02:59:16.170 --> 02:59:18.330
<v Speaker 3>the platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3621
02:59:18.510 --> 02:59:19.343
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going deep.</v>

3622
02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:23.910
<v Speaker 3>The spray paint fucking big a on Tucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlson's driveway.</v>

3623
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:26.830
<v Speaker 1>We mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3624
02:59:28.870 --> 02:59:31.060
<v Speaker 1>if I think about who the great danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3625
02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:33.240
<v Speaker 1>is that Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3626
02:59:33.280 --> 02:59:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who veers towards tin foil hat land with</v>

3627
02:59:35.921 --> 02:59:39.610
<v Speaker 1>some frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it the people who were selling,</v>

3628
02:59:39.630 --> 02:59:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a</v>

3629
02:59:41.771 --> 02:59:45.730
<v Speaker 1>response to nine slash 11 or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>

3630
02:59:46.210 --> 02:59:50.200
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that you're a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person on immigration,</v>

3631
02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:53.290
<v Speaker 1>you neither think that borders should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened or closed.</v>

3632
02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start hearing professors say,</v>

3633
02:59:56.951 --> 02:59:57.784
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing about immigration is </v>

3634
02:59:58.480 --> 02:59:59.313
<v Speaker 1>that it has absolutely no costs and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them are better than all of our </v>

3635
03:00:01.541 --> 03:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>people because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3636
03:00:03.270 --> 03:00:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're highly trained,</v>

3637
03:00:04.361 --> 03:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>they're highly motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're young.</v>

3638
03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3639
03:00:08.141 --> 03:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>what kind of thing has all benefits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no costs.</v>

3640
03:00:11.051 --> 03:00:11.884
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even entering into rational </v>

3641
03:00:13.511 --> 03:00:14.344
<v Speaker 1>description and now we're hearing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these trade deals that got </v>

3642
03:00:16.451 --> 03:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>negotiated.</v>

3643
03:00:17.890 --> 03:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Kinda wasn't true.</v>

3644
03:00:19.360 --> 03:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>All those things that we were telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that if you,</v>

3645
03:00:20.971 --> 03:00:21.804
<v Speaker 1>if you question these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are backward protectionist and you </v>

3646
03:00:24.071 --> 03:00:24.904
<v Speaker 1>were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were stuck in the old world and you </v>

3647
03:00:26.501 --> 03:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>couldn't embrace the new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3648
03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that was all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3649
03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>what I think is we have a crisis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>

3650
03:00:33.610 --> 03:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>institutional expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3651
03:00:36.850 --> 03:00:37.683
<v Speaker 1>is at an all time low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really trusts any of our </v>

3652
03:00:40.841 --> 03:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>institutions to be an authoritative </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of ground truth.</v>

3653
03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:45.873
<v Speaker 1>It's not to say that everything that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution say is wrong or everything </v>

3654
03:00:49.091 --> 03:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>the experts say is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from it.</v>

3655
03:00:51.070 --> 03:00:51.903
<v Speaker 1>It's just that there are almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts or institutions that aren't </v>

3656
03:00:54.221 --> 03:00:55.054
<v Speaker 1>willing to distort facts in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue institutional goals that does a </v>

3657
03:00:59.741 --> 03:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3658
03:01:01.330 --> 03:01:02.163
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't actually want a diy </v>

3659
03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:04.540
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

3660
03:01:04.541 --> 03:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but I do have the very strong sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3661
03:01:06.701 --> 03:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

3662
03:01:07.180 --> 03:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>when Elon came on your show and Peter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Teal,</v>

3663
03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:11.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend and boss came on Dave Rubin </v>

3664
03:01:13.611 --> 03:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3665
03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was quite a moment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>this alternate network of distribution,</v>

3666
03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:20.073
<v Speaker 1>which is not under centralized control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to be seen as comparably </v>

3667
03:01:24.611 --> 03:01:25.444
<v Speaker 1>powerful and important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think some of the noises that </v>

3668
03:01:27.641 --> 03:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Tucker Carlson just made to Dave Ruben </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

3669
03:01:30.941 --> 03:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3670
03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this out of your garage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the freedom to do anything.</v>

3671
03:01:35.171 --> 03:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm beholden to the structure in which I</v>

3672
03:01:38.051 --> 03:01:43.051
<v Speaker 1>live word a very interesting place with </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to what is this thing,</v>

3673
03:01:45.850 --> 03:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this alternate distribution network for,</v>

3674
03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:52.240
<v Speaker 1>for ideas that's unpolished by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

3675
03:01:52.690 --> 03:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think I've been convinced in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last two days that I need.</v>

3676
03:01:56.970 --> 03:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>This is advice that I got from you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning.</v>

3677
03:01:59.171 --> 03:02:00.004
<v Speaker 1>You said you need to start a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I need to start a podcast and I </v>

3678
03:02:03.071 --> 03:02:03.904
<v Speaker 1>think you need to start a podcast just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep going on about the hop thing </v>

3679
03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>until people figured it out just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hot thing,</v>

3680
03:02:10.650 --> 03:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>but we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to return to some kind of stable</v>

3681
03:02:15.761 --> 03:02:16.594
<v Speaker 1>sanity that I'm positive that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions can't return us to because </v>

3682
03:02:20.180 --> 03:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutional interests,</v>

3683
03:02:23.170 --> 03:02:24.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have to do with the fact that </v>

3684
03:02:25.451 --> 03:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of growth on which they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated,</v>

3685
03:02:28.001 --> 03:02:30.340
<v Speaker 1>their existence is predicated if </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaporated.</v>

3686
03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:31.653
<v Speaker 1>So all of these institutions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely vulnerable to corruption at </v>

3687
03:02:36.851 --> 03:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the real revolution as I'm seeing it</v>

3688
03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:44.080
<v Speaker 1>is that high agency individuals are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing,</v>

3689
03:02:44.081 --> 03:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>traditional institutional structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3690
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.943
<v Speaker 1>in terms of mind share and some of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>high agency individuals are </v>

3691
03:02:50.501 --> 03:02:52.150
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3692
03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:52.993
<v Speaker 1>they're like Milo types that are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to light things up and some of </v>

3693
03:02:56.501 --> 03:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>them are extremely responsible and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

3694
03:02:59.490 --> 03:03:00.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do a few irresponsible things but </v>

3695
03:03:01.421 --> 03:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>will self correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this new world that is being born is</v>

3696
03:03:06.041 --> 03:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>a huge check on the institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still largely separate.</v>

3697
03:03:09.341 --> 03:03:10.174
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I right that you don't do a lot of </v>

3698
03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:12.780
<v Speaker 1>network television?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3699
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I used to.</v>

3700
03:03:15.370 --> 03:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how I became famous in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

3701
03:03:17.861 --> 03:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3702
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:20.381
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3703
03:03:20.381 --> 03:03:21.214
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because there's nothing </v>

3704
03:03:22.571 --> 03:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>fun out there like this.</v>

3705
03:03:24.490 --> 03:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no place for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3706
03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:27.633
<v Speaker 1>Other than this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the only place you could do </v>

3707
03:03:28.751 --> 03:03:29.584
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it interesting to you that we </v>

3708
03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>still have not like Jordan had to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with by the mainstream because the</v>

3709
03:03:38.501 --> 03:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>book was too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His affect was too large.</v>

3710
03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I think his effect on the Internet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than the book.</v>

3711
03:03:46.140 --> 03:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think the,</v>

3712
03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the youtube videos and the debates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has.</v>

3713
03:03:50.051 --> 03:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>The one that I was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recent one interview with Gq,</v>

3714
03:03:52.570 --> 03:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

3715
03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:55.173
<v Speaker 1>The woman's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she gets trounced and it's because </v>

3716
03:03:57.681 --> 03:03:58.280
<v Speaker 1>he's been</v>

3717
03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:01.430
<v Speaker 3>in the trenches with this stuff for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

3718
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

3719
03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:03.853
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting a very strange fight of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue and have interpretation of </v>

3720
03:04:07.550 --> 03:04:08.383
<v Speaker 3>discussion and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the freedom of intellectual </v>

3721
03:04:13.881 --> 03:04:15.290
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3722
03:04:15.291 --> 03:04:20.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that want you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think a very certain way and use certain</v>

3723
03:04:20.031 --> 03:04:25.010
<v Speaker 3>words and say certain things and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter whether or not you are in</v>

3724
03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:28.430
<v Speaker 3>fact racist or sexist or homophobic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3725
03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:32.750
<v Speaker 3>There's a weird battle of control going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on that it's a heart of it as much as it</v>

3726
03:04:32.751 --> 03:04:33.584
<v Speaker 3>is a battle of inclusion and diversity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and strengthening our overall </v>

3727
03:04:37.791 --> 03:04:40.520
<v Speaker 3>progressive mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of that too,</v>

3728
03:04:40.700 --> 03:04:41.533
<v Speaker 3>but there's also an undeniable game </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's being played and people want to </v>

3729
03:04:44.451 --> 03:04:46.670
<v Speaker 3>win their scores.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're being scored.</v>

3730
03:04:46.671 --> 03:04:49.280
<v Speaker 3>There's points on the board that </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing in new agents,</v>

3731
03:04:49.281 --> 03:04:50.114
<v Speaker 3>they have teams going at it and whenever</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan goes on one of these </v>

3732
03:04:52.761 --> 03:04:55.970
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these video interviews and as a feminist</v>

3733
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:58.640
<v Speaker 3>and Jordan Peterson like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking game going on.</v>

3734
03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:01.730
<v Speaker 3>We're watching a soccer match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're watching a wrestling match.</v>

3735
03:05:01.731 --> 03:05:05.810
<v Speaker 3>This is Jujitsu there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're playing intellectual Jujitsu and</v>

3736
03:05:05.811 --> 03:05:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Jordan's really good at tapping people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really good at and they get pissed.</v>

3737
03:05:09.021 --> 03:05:13.460
<v Speaker 3>They keep sending in new chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that Kathy Newman Lady,</v>

3738
03:05:13.461 --> 03:05:14.294
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you're saying is that didn't </v>

3739
03:05:15.801 --> 03:05:16.450
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either.</v>

3740
03:05:16.450 --> 03:05:17.283
<v Speaker 3>She just got devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got rocked and this is what's </v>

3741
03:05:19.821 --> 03:05:23.750
<v Speaker 3>happening over and over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 3>because whether you appreciate what he's</v>

3742
03:05:23.751 --> 03:05:28.700
<v Speaker 3>saying or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has some facts that are undeniable.</v>

3743
03:05:28.820 --> 03:05:29.653
<v Speaker 3>He has some positions that are based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a rich understanding of history and of </v>

3744
03:05:32.301 --> 03:05:33.134
<v Speaker 3>Marxism and communism and have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problems with people with compelled </v>

3745
03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:40.843
<v Speaker 3>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're compelling people to behave a </v>

3746
03:05:42.681 --> 03:05:45.170
<v Speaker 3>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling people to talk a certain way,</v>

3747
03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:50.300
<v Speaker 3>and we're not talking about compelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to not commit crimes or violence.</v>

3748
03:05:50.570 --> 03:05:53.300
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about weird things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled</v>

3749
03:05:53.690 --> 03:05:54.523
<v Speaker 1>pronouns and so if I take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I take your analogy because you </v>

3750
03:05:56.901 --> 03:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>brought it up that he's like doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

3751
03:06:01.400 --> 03:06:06.400
<v Speaker 1>so in some previous era I thought your </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of the early days of mma was</v>

3752
03:06:06.891 --> 03:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>fascinating that we just didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what fighting was,</v>

3753
03:06:10.670 --> 03:06:11.503
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't know who would win or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems worked and if you think about </v>

3754
03:06:14.601 --> 03:06:15.434
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream media is like a to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that maybe has some valid </v>

3755
03:06:22.340 --> 03:06:23.173
<v Speaker 1>validity in some very rarefied context </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it comes into general purpose </v>

3756
03:06:27.471 --> 03:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>fighting systems and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dismantled very quickly.</v>

3757
03:06:32.540 --> 03:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>So now we have this weird situation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got this new world of kind of rule</v>

3758
03:06:40.611 --> 03:06:41.444
<v Speaker 1>laden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything goes discussions more or less </v>

3759
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.983
<v Speaker 1>and the mainstream world doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Akita world doesn't want to </v>

3760
03:06:47.811 --> 03:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge that this weird ufc type </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is happening.</v>

3761
03:06:52.250 --> 03:06:55.350
<v Speaker 1>How long does that go on for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes on for as long as it takes.</v>

3762
03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:56.070
<v Speaker 1>And this is</v>

3763
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:59.130
<v Speaker 2>similar to I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what's happening intellectually,</v>

3764
03:06:59.190 --> 03:07:00.023
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think you should stop people from </v>

3765
03:07:02.371 --> 03:07:05.310
<v Speaker 2>expressing these bad ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one thing for stopping people to say,</v>

3766
03:07:05.311 --> 03:07:06.630
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to kill black people.</v>

3767
03:07:06.720 --> 03:07:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Stopping people said we need to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>

3768
03:07:08.371 --> 03:07:09.630
<v Speaker 2>We need to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fill in the blank.</v>

3769
03:07:09.631 --> 03:07:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the group is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3770
03:07:10.681 --> 03:07:12.000
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>

3771
03:07:12.060 --> 03:07:12.600
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3772
03:07:12.600 --> 03:07:13.433
<v Speaker 2>you're clearly stepping outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>realm of civilization and into war and </v>

3773
03:07:18.901 --> 03:07:21.710
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we could all collectively decide and</v>

3774
03:07:21.711 --> 03:07:25.140
<v Speaker 2>we should all collectively decide we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have ethics together.</v>

3775
03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Like whether it's right or left or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle,</v>

3776
03:07:26.971 --> 03:07:27.721
<v Speaker 2>we should all decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3777
03:07:27.721 --> 03:07:28.554
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that because what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is you're calling for violence </v>

3778
03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>against someone who's not committing any</v>
<v Speaker 2>violent.</v>

3779
03:07:33.570 --> 03:07:34.403
<v Speaker 2>Can I pause you right there because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think there's a really interesting </v>

3780
03:07:35.551 --> 03:07:36.384
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

3781
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.983
<v Speaker 2>Let's assume that we know that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior needs to be downregulated in </v>

3782
03:07:42.361 --> 03:07:43.194
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can try to silence the person where </v>

3783
03:07:44.701 --> 03:07:47.460
<v Speaker 2>we just physically duct tape them so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't say anything,</v>

3784
03:07:47.500 --> 03:07:48.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3785
03:07:48.540 --> 03:07:50.150
<v Speaker 2>we put them in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3786
03:07:50.380 --> 03:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>we don't give them access to the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

3787
03:07:52.380 --> 03:07:53.890
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3788
03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:55.013
<v Speaker 2>or we can shame them or we can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>take them aside at what layer of this </v>

3789
03:07:59.641 --> 03:08:02.490
<v Speaker 2>sort of communication stack to very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

3790
03:08:02.491 --> 03:08:03.324
<v Speaker 2>We should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think one of the things that </v>

3791
03:08:04.921 --> 03:08:05.754
<v Speaker 2>we haven't done this to positively say </v>
<v Speaker 2>we agree with you that the speech is </v>

3792
03:08:09.931 --> 03:08:12.540
<v Speaker 2>offensive and it is potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

3793
03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:13.613
<v Speaker 2>but we think it should be downregulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently than the D platforming </v>

3794
03:08:16.771 --> 03:08:18.240
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3795
03:08:18.390 --> 03:08:19.223
<v Speaker 2>the D platforming option,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is there's only a few </v>

3796
03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:26.130
<v Speaker 2>different avenues for these people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>express themselves publicly.</v>

3797
03:08:26.540 --> 03:08:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

3798
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:32.130
<v Speaker 2>the argument that's really strange is </v>
<v Speaker 2>should these be regulated like a utility</v>

3799
03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:36.250
<v Speaker 2>or should they be thought of as private </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses get to decide what's on their</v>

3800
03:08:36.510 --> 03:08:38.590
<v Speaker 2>channel essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's almost like a,</v>

3801
03:08:38.591 --> 03:08:39.400
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3802
03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:44.400
<v Speaker 2>a private NBC that everyone can </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast out if it's none of the above.</v>

3803
03:08:44.820 --> 03:08:46.920
<v Speaker 2>What if the problem is we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend,</v>

3804
03:08:47.010 --> 03:08:49.200
<v Speaker 2>is it like a dinner party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the public square?</v>

3805
03:08:49.280 --> 03:08:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that the utility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's none of these things.</v>

3806
03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:55.850
<v Speaker 2>I think these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was discussing that like there's,</v>

3807
03:08:55.960 --> 03:08:56.793
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why good ideas and bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas should go to war is the same </v>

3808
03:09:01.441 --> 03:09:02.274
<v Speaker 2>reason why even though I kind of knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>that most Kung Fu was bullshit before </v>

3809
03:09:06.841 --> 03:09:07.674
<v Speaker 2>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want those guys to get in there and </v>

3810
03:09:09.331 --> 03:09:10.170
<v Speaker 2>try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3811
03:09:10.171 --> 03:09:12.480
<v Speaker 2>you got some death touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3812
03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:15.270
<v Speaker 2>come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to introduce you to a guy,</v>

3813
03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

3814
03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:17.753
<v Speaker 2>his name's Cain Velasquez and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to try your death touch and now </v>

3815
03:09:20.730 --> 03:09:23.610
<v Speaker 2>he's just going to wrestle to the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat your fucking brains in.</v>

3816
03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:24.473
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not going to happen because </v>

3817
03:09:25.501 --> 03:09:26.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death touch,</v>

3818
03:09:26.251 --> 03:09:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but good luck and you let them duke it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and that is the,</v>

3819
03:09:28.970 --> 03:09:31.560
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is a little.</v>

3820
03:09:31.630 --> 03:09:31.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3821
03:09:31.801 --> 03:09:32.634
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3822
03:09:32.670 --> 03:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>but when you deep platform people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when it's not angry with you.</v>

3823
03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:38.320
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm trying to get at is that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3824
03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:39.713
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't really thought about it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent to which Jordan is the only one </v>

3825
03:09:43.681 --> 03:09:46.680
<v Speaker 2>of us that they've really gone after </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

3826
03:09:47.490 --> 03:09:48.121
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3827
03:09:48.121 --> 03:09:53.121
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he became famous from this,</v>

3828
03:09:53.740 --> 03:09:54.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3829
03:09:54.250 --> 03:09:59.250
<v Speaker 3>This is the battle was wha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he emerged.</v>

3830
03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:04.740
<v Speaker 3>He emerged from this battle over the use</v>
<v Speaker 3>of compelled pronouns for,</v>

3831
03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:06.573
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>various genders like the bread 78 </v>

3832
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:13.310
<v Speaker 3>different genders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Similar but not okay.</v>

3833
03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:18.550
<v Speaker 3>The difference is Brett's position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes from a different place,</v>

3834
03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:21.640
<v Speaker 3>the way they were going at him with so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more than reasonable.</v>

3835
03:10:22.420 --> 03:10:23.253
<v Speaker 3>They were saying right away that what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do is leave work because he's </v>

3836
03:10:28.691 --> 03:10:29.524
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were basically saying a racist </v>

3837
03:10:31.931 --> 03:10:34.720
<v Speaker 3>thing and everyone universally </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledged as racist,</v>

3838
03:10:34.810 --> 03:10:35.643
<v Speaker 3>except for the super lefties who thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it made sense because in their </v>

3839
03:10:40.391 --> 03:10:43.330
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every white person is somehow or another</v>

3840
03:10:43.331 --> 03:10:44.164
<v Speaker 3>guilty of at least at the very least </v>
<v Speaker 3>using your privilege to advance in the </v>

3841
03:10:48.641 --> 03:10:50.340
<v Speaker 3>world at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3842
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:56.030
<v Speaker 3>to the negative impact of people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>color and people of other ethnicities.</v>

3843
03:10:56.920 --> 03:10:57.753
<v Speaker 3>So they decided that they are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a day of exclusion and instead of </v>

3844
03:11:00.671 --> 03:11:05.671
<v Speaker 3>this day of absence having black people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people of color stay home,</v>

3845
03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:07.990
<v Speaker 3>they were going to kick white people </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3846
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:11.290
<v Speaker 3>So it became an aggressive act instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an act of appreciation,</v>

3847
03:11:11.490 --> 03:11:12.240
<v Speaker 3>it became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3848
03:11:12.240 --> 03:11:16.900
<v Speaker 3>an act of punishment or an act of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusion and by people that are clearly</v>

3849
03:11:16.901 --> 03:11:17.734
<v Speaker 3>out of their fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was also part of the problem is </v>

3850
03:11:19.331 --> 03:11:20.920
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their arguments were incoherent.</v>

3851
03:11:21.130 --> 03:11:21.963
<v Speaker 3>You'd see that fucking stupid president </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the university standing in front of </v>

3852
03:11:25.631 --> 03:11:26.464
<v Speaker 3>those kids and they told him to put his </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands down because he was threatening </v>

3853
03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:29.821
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3854
03:11:29.821 --> 03:11:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you're scaring us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making violent gestures with your</v>

3855
03:11:32.231 --> 03:11:34.060
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he puts his hands down and they start</v>

3856
03:11:34.061 --> 03:11:36.100
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is nonsense.</v>

3857
03:11:36.101 --> 03:11:36.934
<v Speaker 3>Now you're in little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got little kids running lord of the </v>

3858
03:11:39.011 --> 03:11:42.160
<v Speaker 3>flies on a grand scale in a state </v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

3859
03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:43.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3860
03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:44.770
<v Speaker 3>this is a public university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3861
03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they get funding,</v>

3862
03:11:46.180 --> 03:11:47.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all chaos.</v>

3863
03:11:47.621 --> 03:11:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Nobody agrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got baseball bats.</v>

3864
03:11:49.540 --> 03:11:51.700
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he's coming back to the school,</v>

3865
03:11:51.790 --> 03:11:55.660
<v Speaker 3>the kids form these vigilante groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>with weapons over what?</v>

3866
03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Like who's threatening you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is happening?</v>

3867
03:11:58.320 --> 03:11:59.153
<v Speaker 3>You need weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the big story there was the non </v>

3868
03:12:01.151 --> 03:12:03.250
<v Speaker 3>reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

3869
03:12:03.251 --> 03:12:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the New York Times,</v>

3870
03:12:04.631 --> 03:12:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these major organs,</v>

3871
03:12:07.301 --> 03:12:08.590
<v Speaker 3>NPR,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't report.</v>

3872
03:12:08.650 --> 03:12:10.570
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to touch the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3873
03:12:10.571 --> 03:12:11.404
<v Speaker 3>this is what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My big theory here is that every outfit </v>

3874
03:12:15.851 --> 03:12:16.684
<v Speaker 3>that has a a grand narrative cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>report the news that goes counter </v>

3875
03:12:20.951 --> 03:12:21.784
<v Speaker 3>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so racism by blacks against whites </v>

3876
03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:25.593
<v Speaker 3>cannot be reported by any outfit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>believes that racism is impossible by </v>

3877
03:12:30.761 --> 03:12:34.120
<v Speaker 3>blacks against whites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that such a preposterous position.</v>

3878
03:12:34.330 --> 03:12:37.060
<v Speaker 3>The idea that racism is exclusive to any</v>
<v Speaker 3>group will,</v>

3879
03:12:37.061 --> 03:12:40.570
<v Speaker 3>but the redefinition of definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the redefinition could suck a fat dick.</v>

3880
03:12:40.600 --> 03:12:42.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a stupid redefinition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

3881
03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:43.593
<v Speaker 3>This idea that the only way you can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist as if you have power over that </v>

3882
03:12:46.901 --> 03:12:48.160
<v Speaker 3>other group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nonsense.</v>

3883
03:12:48.161 --> 03:12:48.994
<v Speaker 3>Every human beings act as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they always have power over each </v>

3884
03:12:51.321 --> 03:12:51.980
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have</v>

3885
03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:54.620
<v Speaker 1>power to intimidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have power to isolate.</v>

3886
03:12:54.621 --> 03:12:57.890
<v Speaker 1>You have power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's more using about this is that</v>

3887
03:12:59.090 --> 03:13:01.580
<v Speaker 1>there is no pretense of consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3888
03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:02.473
<v Speaker 1>on that side of the aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're going to throw out the </v>

3889
03:13:06.171 --> 03:13:10.250
<v Speaker 1>following 17 completely contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and then we'll tell you which rule</v>

3890
03:13:10.251 --> 03:13:12.050
<v Speaker 1>is operative in any given moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3891
03:13:12.530 --> 03:13:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to throw out this concept of</v>

3892
03:13:14.541 --> 03:13:17.840
<v Speaker 1>the Hilbert problems for social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of them is,</v>

3893
03:13:18.350 --> 03:13:19.183
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot understand me because my </v>

3894
03:13:21.411 --> 03:13:22.244
<v Speaker 1>experience is too different and you must</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand me because mine is so </v>

3895
03:13:24.981 --> 03:13:26.320
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3896
03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3897
03:13:27.490 --> 03:13:32.490
<v Speaker 1>we're all similar enough that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation from 50 slash 50 shows you the</v>

3898
03:13:32.961 --> 03:13:33.794
<v Speaker 1>amount of sexism in a workforce and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are all so different that once you </v>

3899
03:13:37.191 --> 03:13:38.630
<v Speaker 1>include women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3900
03:13:38.631 --> 03:13:39.464
<v Speaker 1>in previously male occupations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see a great benefit because of </v>

3901
03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:43.970
<v Speaker 1>the diversity of opinion.</v>

3902
03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Once he saw all these self-contradictory</v>
<v Speaker 1>couplets that you have to agree to.</v>

3903
03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:49.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the weird thing is who assumed </v>

3904
03:13:53.261 --> 03:13:54.094
<v Speaker 1>that I just buy all of your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've made a terrible tactical </v>

3905
03:13:56.511 --> 03:13:57.344
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought these bad ideas rather than </v>

3906
03:13:59.631 --> 03:14:04.631
<v Speaker 1>saying maybe we should just accept all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your bad ideas and then show you what</v>

3907
03:14:04.971 --> 03:14:07.930
<v Speaker 1>kind of a weird world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3908
03:14:07.931 --> 03:14:08.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3909
03:14:08.980 --> 03:14:09.261
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3910
03:14:09.261 --> 03:14:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

3911
03:14:11.930 --> 03:14:12.830
<v Speaker 1>You can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3912
03:14:12.831 --> 03:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>they make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men,</v>

3913
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:15.200
<v Speaker 1>how do I know when you're serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3914
03:14:15.201 --> 03:14:16.034
<v Speaker 1>but that's my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let those through and does things </v>

3915
03:14:17.091 --> 03:14:17.924
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's my point is that by showing </v>

3916
03:14:20.931 --> 03:14:23.570
<v Speaker 1>the internal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in mathematics.</v>

3917
03:14:23.571 --> 03:14:24.404
<v Speaker 1>We call this reductio ad absurdum that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you take on too many different </v>

3918
03:14:27.321 --> 03:14:28.154
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show the conflicts showing that </v>

3919
03:14:30.560 --> 03:14:31.393
<v Speaker 1>those things can't all be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way in which if I accept all </v>

3920
03:14:35.121 --> 03:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>of your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can run anything.</v>

3921
03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:38.331
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3922
03:14:38.331 --> 03:14:41.750
<v Speaker 1>take this thing about a trans exclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Victoria secret,</v>

3923
03:14:42.770 --> 03:14:44.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't hear about this.</v>

3924
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:45.523
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that the Victoria secret </v>

3925
03:14:48.411 --> 03:14:51.920
<v Speaker 1>lingerie division head had to step down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3926
03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:53.113
<v Speaker 1>where there was a scandal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background that somebody had said we </v>

3927
03:14:55.431 --> 03:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>don't actually want a trans people </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking the Victoria secret runway.</v>

3928
03:15:01.220 --> 03:15:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very interesting.</v>

3929
03:15:03.351 --> 03:15:08.351
<v Speaker 1>You have a company that is dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the commercial exploitation of humans as</v>

3930
03:15:09.111 --> 03:15:11.750
<v Speaker 1>sexual objects for the privilege of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>male gaze.</v>

3931
03:15:12.470 --> 03:15:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And now you're angry that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>include trans into that exploited class.</v>

3932
03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.943
<v Speaker 1>So just without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting into whether this makes </v>

3933
03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:22.333
<v Speaker 1>good economic sense or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just the issue of self </v>

3934
03:15:24.471 --> 03:15:25.304
<v Speaker 1>contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that a reductionist view of </v>

3935
03:15:27.081 --> 03:15:27.914
<v Speaker 1>what Victoria secrets is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it possible that a woman can feel </v>

3936
03:15:30.591 --> 03:15:31.424
<v Speaker 1>empowered and sexy if she's wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>lingerie and it's not just to the </v>

3937
03:15:33.801 --> 03:15:38.801
<v Speaker 1>exploiting of the male gaze that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she appreciates looking attractive.</v>

3938
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take that off.</v>

3939
03:15:40.231 --> 03:15:40.791
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3940
03:15:40.791 --> 03:15:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that you're both going to</v>

3941
03:15:43.131 --> 03:15:43.964
<v Speaker 1>say I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a positive female </v>

3942
03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:50.033
<v Speaker 1>empowerment issue and it's a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>male expectation as you at the same </v>

3943
03:15:53.101 --> 03:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible male exploitation issue.</v>

3944
03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what if a guy likes what if women </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide universally,</v>

3945
03:15:58.951 --> 03:15:59.784
<v Speaker 1>they like guys who wear leopard skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwear and guidestar wearing leopard </v>

3946
03:16:02.401 --> 03:16:05.260
<v Speaker 1>skin tidy whitey underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is sexual selection but,</v>

3947
03:16:05.310 --> 03:16:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3948
03:16:06.361 --> 03:16:08.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's the difference between that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women wearing lingerie.</v>

3949
03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:09.713
<v Speaker 1>If women wear lingerie and they do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they like to be an interesting </v>

3950
03:16:13.171 --> 03:16:14.004
<v Speaker 1>stat and they liked to be more try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're to accentuate their </v>

3951
03:16:16.321 --> 03:16:17.154
<v Speaker 1>attracts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the sexual self objectification </v>

3952
03:16:19.021 --> 03:16:21.690
<v Speaker 1>is an interesting issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an issue of empowerment or is an</v>

3953
03:16:21.691 --> 03:16:23.730
<v Speaker 1>issue of oppression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could certainly be.</v>

3954
03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:24.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what if a woman's health to take </v>

3955
03:16:25.261 --> 03:16:26.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that all on.</v>

3956
03:16:26.190 --> 03:16:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to be exploitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

3957
03:16:27.850 --> 03:16:28.683
<v Speaker 1>That's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm trying to say is you've t </v>

3958
03:16:30.780 --> 03:16:32.850
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've made too many arguments.</v>

3959
03:16:32.851 --> 03:16:36.330
<v Speaker 1>There's this concept called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of explosion in mathematics.</v>

3960
03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:37.553
<v Speaker 1>The principle of explosion says if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get one contradiction through </v>

3961
03:16:40.021 --> 03:16:40.854
<v Speaker 1>airport security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can blow up the universe as soon as </v>

3962
03:16:43.531 --> 03:16:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you allow a single contradiction in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity of knowledge,</v>

3963
03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:49.680
<v Speaker 1>everything can be proven right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything becomes meaningless.</v>

3964
03:16:50.220 --> 03:16:54.210
<v Speaker 1>So the game in some sense in mathematics</v>
<v Speaker 1>is frequently to say,</v>

3965
03:16:54.211 --> 03:16:56.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take all of those beautiful things</v>

3966
03:16:56.161 --> 03:16:59.310
<v Speaker 1>that you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've just created some done seated.</v>

3967
03:16:59.330 --> 03:17:00.163
<v Speaker 1>Some throw them all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying what's true and what </v>

3968
03:17:02.581 --> 03:17:04.500
<v Speaker 1>isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

3969
03:17:04.530 --> 03:17:05.363
<v Speaker 1>are these compatible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these ideas are clearly </v>

3970
03:17:07.861 --> 03:17:09.840
<v Speaker 1>incompatible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

3971
03:17:09.930 --> 03:17:10.763
<v Speaker 1>one of the tricks that I use is to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at advertising for women to women and </v>

3972
03:17:18.211 --> 03:17:19.530
<v Speaker 1>what phrases get used.</v>

3973
03:17:19.560 --> 03:17:20.393
<v Speaker 1>So if you used the phrase turn heads the</v>
<v Speaker 1>summer in quotes and put it into a </v>

3974
03:17:23.311 --> 03:17:24.144
<v Speaker 1>search engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find all sorts of revealing </v>

3975
03:17:27.151 --> 03:17:29.730
<v Speaker 1>outfits that are intended to court the </v>
<v Speaker 1>male gaze.</v>

3976
03:17:30.450 --> 03:17:31.283
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's not really the male </v>

3977
03:17:32.161 --> 03:17:32.994
<v Speaker 1>gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you put in a phrase like make </v>

3978
03:17:33.811 --> 03:17:37.560
<v Speaker 1>him drool and that will be used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>market to women.</v>

3979
03:17:38.460 --> 03:17:43.460
<v Speaker 1>And so this issue about can we at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to a point where we're talking about</v>

3980
03:17:44.131 --> 03:17:46.560
<v Speaker 1>the internal contradictions of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position?</v>

3981
03:17:46.590 --> 03:17:47.423
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to get into what my </v>

3982
03:17:48.601 --> 03:17:49.434
<v Speaker 1>position is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that's scaring me is </v>

3983
03:17:51.691 --> 03:17:54.960
<v Speaker 1>that you've said so many things so </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly and so dogmatically,</v>

3984
03:17:54.961 --> 03:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>and this doesn't have to be about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>

3985
03:17:56.671 --> 03:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>It could be about race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be about class,</v>

3986
03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:01.890
<v Speaker 1>but when once you've said too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3987
03:18:02.490 --> 03:18:03.450
<v Speaker 1>then I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3988
03:18:03.780 --> 03:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any way of squaring all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your positions and it's not.</v>

3989
03:18:08.610 --> 03:18:09.443
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have to do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where we haven't gone to </v>

3990
03:18:13.111 --> 03:18:13.944
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think letting them come up with </v>

3991
03:18:15.691 --> 03:18:16.524
<v Speaker 1>as many preposterous things as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once it gets to a position </v>

3992
03:18:20.191 --> 03:18:21.120
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3993
03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the idea's contradicted each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expose that.</v>

3994
03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my point,</v>

3995
03:18:24.781 --> 03:18:27.320
<v Speaker 1>which is once you've told me all of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>principals,</v>

3996
03:18:28.470 --> 03:18:29.880
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

3997
03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:31.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that I have to understand </v>

3998
03:18:33.601 --> 03:18:34.434
<v Speaker 1>you or that I can't understand you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know which is operative </v>

3999
03:18:38.071 --> 03:18:38.904
<v Speaker 1>in this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the rule how I decide which </v>

4000
03:18:41.521 --> 03:18:44.940
<v Speaker 1>principle that you've stated governed </v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation.</v>

4001
03:18:45.850 --> 03:18:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if.</v>

4002
03:18:47.530 --> 03:18:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One</v>

4003
03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:49.113
<v Speaker 2>last point about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to refer to you </v>

4004
03:18:53.350 --> 03:18:54.100
<v Speaker 2>where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4005
03:18:54.100 --> 03:18:54.933
<v Speaker 2>you bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring me each individual situation </v>

4006
03:18:56.560 --> 03:18:57.393
<v Speaker 2>and I will tell you which principals </v>
<v Speaker 2>operative in which principals </v>

4007
03:19:00.490 --> 03:19:04.540
<v Speaker 2>inoperative that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to list your principles,</v>

4008
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:08.470
<v Speaker 2>enlist your mechanisms for resolving the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts within your principles.</v>

4009
03:19:08.950 --> 03:19:09.783
<v Speaker 2>And then once you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can actually evaluate what you're </v>

4010
03:19:12.881 --> 03:19:13.714
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the moment it requires you as an </v>

4011
03:19:15.610 --> 03:19:16.443
<v Speaker 2>oracle to tell me which of your many </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradict your seemingly contradictory </v>

4012
03:19:20.081 --> 03:19:23.500
<v Speaker 2>positions is operative in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular case.</v>

4013
03:19:23.710 --> 03:19:24.543
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did that one with the person who was </v>

4014
03:19:27.581 --> 03:19:29.410
<v Speaker 2>the quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4015
03:19:29.970 --> 03:19:31.510
<v Speaker 2>ex Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans,</v>

4016
03:19:31.511 --> 03:19:32.260
<v Speaker 2>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4017
03:19:32.260 --> 03:19:34.810
<v Speaker 2>everything going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is operative,</v>

4018
03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:35.673
<v Speaker 2>the person with mckayla phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a extremely rare psychological </v>

4019
03:19:39.310 --> 03:19:40.143
<v Speaker 2>condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the person who appears to be a deep </v>

4020
03:19:44.081 --> 03:19:45.880
<v Speaker 2>into some self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4021
03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:47.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some radical self actualization </v>

4022
03:19:49.331 --> 03:19:53.680
<v Speaker 2>principal or even a person who wears </v>
<v Speaker 2>that crazy makeup should be able to wear</v>

4023
03:19:53.681 --> 03:19:54.330
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want.</v>

4024
03:19:54.330 --> 03:19:55.163
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to dress like Paul </v>

4025
03:19:56.500 --> 03:19:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Stanley from kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your,</v>

4026
03:19:57.490 --> 03:19:59.230
<v Speaker 2>to assume that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if,</v>

4027
03:19:59.231 --> 03:20:01.120
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a heterosexual male,</v>

4028
03:20:01.121 --> 03:20:03.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4029
03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:05.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crying game at the Victoria secret </v>

4030
03:20:07.720 --> 03:20:09.790
<v Speaker 2>runway show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that,</v>

4031
03:20:09.791 --> 03:20:11.710
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really think that Victoria secret</v>

4032
03:20:11.770 --> 03:20:15.460
<v Speaker 2>runway shows for the heterosexual male </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense?</v>

4033
03:20:15.461 --> 03:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What guys,</v>

4034
03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:21.690
<v Speaker 2>has he ever watched a Victoria secrets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the guy said.</v>

4035
03:20:21.691 --> 03:20:24.700
<v Speaker 2>He said it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's branding it as.</v>

4036
03:20:25.580 --> 03:20:25.811
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4037
03:20:25.811 --> 03:20:26.590
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4038
03:20:26.590 --> 03:20:30.250
<v Speaker 2>there's something between a fantasy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Victoria secrets.</v>

4039
03:20:30.270 --> 03:20:35.270
<v Speaker 2>A senior executive recently told that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trans models don't belong in the fantasy</v>

4040
03:20:35.920 --> 03:20:38.560
<v Speaker 2>of Victoria secret's fashion show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4041
03:20:39.100 --> 03:20:39.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4042
03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:41.940
<v Speaker 2>that's on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4043
03:20:41.970 --> 03:20:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he wants to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just because he said it doesn't mean</v>

4044
03:20:44.531 --> 03:20:45.160
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

4045
03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:45.993
<v Speaker 2>I guess if you looked at the graph of </v>
<v Speaker 2>male to female viewers have a Victoria </v>

4046
03:20:49.511 --> 03:20:50.650
<v Speaker 2>secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4047
03:20:50.800 --> 03:20:55.120
<v Speaker 2>It would be like a few prepubescent boys</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the vast majority of women and maybe</v>

4048
03:20:55.121 --> 03:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>some gay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's it.</v>

4049
03:20:56.770 --> 03:20:57.603
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be without fuck is sitting </v>

4050
03:21:00.161 --> 03:21:02.590
<v Speaker 2>around with on honor an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

4051
03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:03.251
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4052
03:21:03.251 --> 03:21:05.710
<v Speaker 2>some popcorn ready for the Victoria's </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret fashion show.</v>

4053
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:06.663
<v Speaker 2>Dogs coming over and Mike and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to drill to TV thought fuck Outta </v>

<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

4055
03:21:12.250 --> 03:21:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is for chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4056
03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:15.713
<v Speaker 2>Runway Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the single guy out there </v>

4057
03:21:17.561 --> 03:21:19.540
<v Speaker 2>watching runway shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4058
03:21:19.570 --> 03:21:24.570
<v Speaker 2>remember when playboy had play girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was her gay gay dudes.</v>

4059
03:21:24.770 --> 03:21:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Not for chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4060
03:21:26.380 --> 03:21:29.350
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to see that and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to see runways.</v>

4061
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.920
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

4062
03:21:29.920 --> 03:21:30.753
<v Speaker 2>We're not here for runways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get bored easy bunch of chicks </v>

4063
03:21:33.641 --> 03:21:37.540
<v Speaker 2>walking around in their underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're calling it very.</v>

4064
03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:39.940
<v Speaker 2>You may be right about who the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

4065
03:21:39.941 --> 03:21:40.774
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea on the demographics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never watched one of these in my </v>

4066
03:21:42.611 --> 03:21:43.444
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the case that I believe </v>

4067
03:21:45.621 --> 03:21:46.454
<v Speaker 2>that male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the male gaze is nowhere to be found </v>

4068
03:21:48.231 --> 03:21:49.064
<v Speaker 2>here because it's a very weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the female is largely buying a an </v>

4069
03:21:54.561 --> 03:21:57.920
<v Speaker 2>amplifier for something that is supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to excite a male,</v>

4070
03:21:57.921 --> 03:21:58.754
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit to me like the female </v>

4071
03:22:01.491 --> 03:22:06.020
<v Speaker 2>is the magician buying magic supplies at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a store for the audience.</v>

4072
03:22:06.380 --> 03:22:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

4073
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:08.960
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>

4074
03:22:09.290 --> 03:22:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The male gaze is absent.</v>

4075
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I just don't buy his interpretation at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4076
03:22:13.881 --> 03:22:14.714
<v Speaker 2>It's a fantasy for men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ruined with Trans men or trans </v>

4077
03:22:17.091 --> 03:22:17.360
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

4078
03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:18.193
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have.</v>

4079
03:22:18.600 --> 03:22:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a dog in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems silly.</v>

4080
03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:21.873
<v Speaker 2>It seems silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you don't want transgender </v>

4081
03:22:23.181 --> 03:22:26.120
<v Speaker 2>people to be in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to say you can't say.</v>

4082
03:22:26.121 --> 03:22:28.220
<v Speaker 2>It ruins the fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just say,</v>

4083
03:22:28.240 --> 03:22:30.500
<v Speaker 2>I will only hiring people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaginas,</v>

4084
03:22:30.890 --> 03:22:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want.</v>

4085
03:22:32.350 --> 03:22:33.183
<v Speaker 2>Like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's certain jobs if you go to </v>

4086
03:22:34.881 --> 03:22:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Chippendale's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our trans women shown up,</v>

4087
03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:38.563
<v Speaker 2>trans men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they at chippendales where they're </v>

4088
03:22:41.320 --> 03:22:44.600
<v Speaker 2>down there because they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dick and but they're all jacked and they</v>

4089
03:22:44.601 --> 03:22:45.434
<v Speaker 2>looked like a man is just what women </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to see and are they transphobic if </v>

4090
03:22:47.841 --> 03:22:50.510
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If women go to a,</v>

4091
03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:51.393
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those all mail review shows and </v>

4092
03:22:53.181 --> 03:22:56.360
<v Speaker 2>it's all trans men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're heterosexual and they're not</v>

4093
03:22:56.361 --> 03:22:57.290
<v Speaker 2>really into trans man.</v>

4094
03:22:57.290 --> 03:23:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Are they all phobic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4095
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:02.990
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm trying to get at is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hierarchy,</v>

4096
03:23:03.010 --> 03:23:03.843
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not that interested in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the particulars of Victoria's </v>

4097
03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:10.010
<v Speaker 2>secret's profitability and what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>statements are.</v>

4098
03:23:10.300 --> 03:23:13.380
<v Speaker 2>What I'm more interested in is you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut,</v>

4099
03:23:13.430 --> 03:23:14.263
<v Speaker 2>you've annunciated so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different principles at </v>

4100
03:23:17.931 --> 03:23:22.931
<v Speaker 2>work as to what should govern in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict that you won't tell me.</v>

4101
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:24.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

4102
03:23:24.381 --> 03:23:25.214
<v Speaker 2>When these two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two beautiful things that you've </v>

4103
03:23:26.661 --> 03:23:27.494
<v Speaker 2>said actually lie in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you resolve the conflicts and it </v>

4104
03:23:30.891 --> 03:23:31.790
<v Speaker 2>seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4105
03:23:31.850 --> 03:23:32.683
<v Speaker 2>why don't you consult us on every single</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these and we'll tell you a case </v>

4106
03:23:36.891 --> 03:23:37.724
<v Speaker 2>by case and that can't work because what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know is I don't want to </v>

4107
03:23:41.121 --> 03:23:41.954
<v Speaker 2>appoint you as an oracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to state what your positions </v>

4108
03:23:44.691 --> 03:23:45.524
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to state how you harmonize </v>

4109
03:23:46.671 --> 03:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>them and then we're having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

4110
03:23:49.221 --> 03:23:50.054
<v Speaker 2>but as long as I have to keep going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and your crazy definitions and </v>

4111
03:23:53.541 --> 03:23:55.070
<v Speaker 2>you're well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is operative on,</v>

4112
03:23:55.120 --> 03:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>on Alternate Tuesdays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't work.</v>

4113
03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I completely see your point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

4114
03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:02.780
<v Speaker 2>you can't give ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't give grounded nonsense because</v>

4115
03:24:02.781 --> 03:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>that ground was never get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never getting it back.</v>

4116
03:24:05.540 --> 03:24:08.660
<v Speaker 2>If you allow them to establish certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous principles,</v>

4117
03:24:08.661 --> 03:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>rules that are contradictory to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

4118
03:24:10.311 --> 03:24:12.140
<v Speaker 2>they'll come up with a reason why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sense.</v>

4119
03:24:12.141 --> 03:24:12.311
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4120
03:24:12.311 --> 03:24:13.144
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't allow them to put it into the </v>

4121
03:24:14.301 --> 03:24:15.290
<v Speaker 2>workforce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

4122
03:24:15.291 --> 03:24:17.330
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we put it into the workforce,</v>

4123
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:21.350
<v Speaker 2>let's just understand the 17 different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you've said.</v>

4124
03:24:21.351 --> 03:24:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Are absolutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4125
03:24:22.821 --> 03:24:23.654
<v Speaker 2>you're basically doing then what Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 2>does and every single one of these </v>

4126
03:24:25.881 --> 03:24:26.714
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you letting people lay out their idea </v>

4127
03:24:28.851 --> 03:24:31.010
<v Speaker 2>and then you shoot them down and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide what's.</v>

4128
03:24:31.060 --> 03:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>What's logical and what's illogical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>

4129
03:24:34.460 --> 03:24:39.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the UFC of ideas and this is why </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to let these shitty ideas</v>

4130
03:24:39.081 --> 03:24:39.914
<v Speaker 2>into the match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we still have so much caught up </v>

4131
03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:44.730
<v Speaker 2>in the Akita League</v>

4132
03:24:44.820 --> 03:24:45.653
<v Speaker 1>in the country?</v>

4133
03:24:46.050 --> 03:24:46.883
<v Speaker 3>Because it sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People liked the idea that you don't </v>

4134
03:24:48.541 --> 03:24:49.374
<v Speaker 3>have to learn much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just go in there with a death </v>

4135
03:24:50.461 --> 03:24:51.510
<v Speaker 3>touch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck people up.</v>

4136
03:24:51.930 --> 03:24:54.750
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to think that all you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to practice for 10,000</v>

4137
03:24:54.751 --> 03:24:55.584
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to sprawl and work on your leg </v>

4138
03:24:57.421 --> 03:25:01.560
<v Speaker 3>kicks and working with this public </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaming is death touch well,</v>

4139
03:25:01.590 --> 03:25:04.500
<v Speaker 3>debating these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think honestly,</v>

4140
03:25:04.501 --> 03:25:07.470
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not trying to blow Air Jordan's </v>
<v Speaker 3>horn anymore than I already have,</v>

4141
03:25:07.710 --> 03:25:08.543
<v Speaker 3>but I think what he does is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>important because he is one of the few </v>

4142
03:25:12.570 --> 03:25:15.900
<v Speaker 3>that engages in these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these very public forums,</v>

4143
03:25:16.170 --> 03:25:17.003
<v Speaker 3>in these long form debates where they go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to war with ideas and these are way </v>

4144
03:25:21.211 --> 03:25:24.510
<v Speaker 3>better their conversations because </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's fucking good at it,</v>

4145
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:28.260
<v Speaker 3>they want to chop them to not picking </v>
<v Speaker 3>you so much because I'm friendly.</v>

4146
03:25:28.590 --> 03:25:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as combative as he is,</v>

4147
03:25:32.321 --> 03:25:35.190
<v Speaker 3>so I send them also not as smart as he </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and I'm also not as.</v>

4148
03:25:35.250 --> 03:25:36.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have credentials.</v>

4149
03:25:37.150 --> 03:25:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the credentials that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>

4150
03:25:39.100 --> 03:25:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Like when he is the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto professor,</v>

4151
03:25:41.530 --> 03:25:42.363
<v Speaker 3>a Phd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's going to war with these </v>

4152
03:25:44.101 --> 03:25:45.040
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

4153
03:25:45.041 --> 03:25:48.540
<v Speaker 3>they're throwing out valiant warriors to</v>
<v Speaker 3>die at his sword.</v>

4154
03:25:48.541 --> 03:25:50.230
<v Speaker 3>What did you hear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What to watch?</v>

4155
03:25:50.380 --> 03:25:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Bread and Richard Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cargo.</v>

4156
03:25:52.950 --> 03:25:54.970
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They appeared on the stage for the first</v>

4157
03:25:54.971 --> 03:25:56.890
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They oppose each other.</v>

4158
03:25:56.920 --> 03:25:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

4159
03:25:57.881 --> 03:26:00.010
<v Speaker 1>On religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4160
03:26:00.011 --> 03:26:01.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Dawkins now.</v>

4161
03:26:01.331 --> 03:26:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Religious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4162
03:26:02.281 --> 03:26:02.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4163
03:26:02.461 --> 03:26:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins is staunchly in that a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new atheists,</v>

4164
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:08.620
<v Speaker 1>aggressive guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I panic because I know you had a stroke.</v>

4165
03:26:08.820 --> 03:26:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay guys.</v>

4166
03:26:10.010 --> 03:26:12.520
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought your brother was an atheist as</v>

4167
03:26:12.521 --> 03:26:15.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Brett doesn't think that religion is</v>

4168
03:26:15.971 --> 03:26:17.930
<v Speaker 1>a virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not Paris.</v>

4169
03:26:18.730 --> 03:26:23.730
<v Speaker 1>He believes that religion is actually an</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation and the weird thing was is he</v>

4170
03:26:23.771 --> 03:26:24.604
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4171
03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:25.833
<v Speaker 1>there's young Dawkins and there's old </v>
<v Speaker 1>dock and young Dawkins came up with </v>

4172
03:26:28.481 --> 03:26:31.120
<v Speaker 1>these two powerful ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the meme,</v>

4173
03:26:31.121 --> 03:26:36.121
<v Speaker 1>the unit of ideation a is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a gene like object.</v>

4174
03:26:39.100 --> 03:26:42.070
<v Speaker 1>He also came up with the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended phenotype.</v>

4175
03:26:42.071 --> 03:26:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So when you talked about that ant mound </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were excavating,</v>

4176
03:26:45.850 --> 03:26:50.680
<v Speaker 1>that ant mound is in some sense part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the and strategy.</v>

4177
03:26:50.680 --> 03:26:51.513
<v Speaker 1>It's such a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so deeply tied in that you have to </v>

4178
03:26:54.971 --> 03:26:55.804
<v Speaker 1>consider the ant mound is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ant system because it can't exist </v>

4179
03:26:59.051 --> 03:27:01.090
<v Speaker 1>without that complicated underground </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

4180
03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4181
03:27:02.110 --> 03:27:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And so what he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4182
03:27:03.821 --> 03:27:04.654
<v Speaker 1>if I use these two concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that memes are like genes and the genes </v>

4183
03:27:10.601 --> 03:27:13.840
<v Speaker 1>can throw off a bad meme instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So genes,</v>

4184
03:27:13.900 --> 03:27:18.310
<v Speaker 1>memes have to ride on a gene and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't parasitize it too much,</v>

4185
03:27:18.730 --> 03:27:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and you also have this inclusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness,</v>

4186
03:27:21.161 --> 03:27:21.994
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be religions co travel with us </v>

4187
03:27:23.711 --> 03:27:24.544
<v Speaker 1>and allow us to outcompete those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have them because they seem to be </v>

4188
03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:28.953
<v Speaker 1>found everywhere.</v>

4189
03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:30.040
<v Speaker 3>So prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4190
03:27:30.070 --> 03:27:32.050
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at it objectively,</v>

4191
03:27:32.260 --> 03:27:33.093
<v Speaker 3>not looked at it in terms of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you feel about cult like behavior </v>

4192
03:27:38.111 --> 03:27:41.530
<v Speaker 3>and people's susceptibility to </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>

4193
03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:42.100
<v Speaker 3>If you just looked</v>

4194
03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:42.933
<v Speaker 2>at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were from another dementia and </v>

4195
03:27:44.131 --> 03:27:44.561
<v Speaker 2>you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4196
03:27:44.561 --> 03:27:46.840
<v Speaker 2>clearly this is a part of being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful person.</v>

4197
03:27:46.841 --> 03:27:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4198
03:27:47.890 --> 03:27:50.080
<v Speaker 2>So Brett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brett and Dawkins met,</v>

4199
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:53.380
<v Speaker 2>and I think Dawkins had this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction like,</v>

4200
03:27:53.470 --> 03:27:54.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm meeting an ultra Darwinist who's </v>

4201
03:27:58.211 --> 03:27:59.044
<v Speaker 2>read my work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it seriously and is feeding it </v>

4202
03:28:02.201 --> 03:28:04.060
<v Speaker 2>back in and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4203
03:28:04.120 --> 03:28:05.320
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins,</v>

4204
03:28:05.321 --> 03:28:08.260
<v Speaker 2>in your younger years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>established ideas.</v>

4205
03:28:08.680 --> 03:28:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that,</v>

4206
03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:12.880
<v Speaker 2>when those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical consequences or explored,</v>

4207
03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:14.193
<v Speaker 2>it completely negates your late life </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred for religion because it reveals </v>

4208
03:28:18.911 --> 03:28:19.744
<v Speaker 2>it to be an adaptation rather than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pair of citizen action of the human </v>

4209
03:28:22.091 --> 03:28:23.550
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

4210
03:28:23.551 --> 03:28:27.610
<v Speaker 2>The real problem that I've always had </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Dawkins and his take on religion is</v>

4211
03:28:27.611 --> 03:28:28.444
<v Speaker 2>not that he's wrong or they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's his anger that he has when he's </v>

4212
03:28:32.801 --> 03:28:35.020
<v Speaker 2>talking to people that believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4213
03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:35.600
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4214
03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:36.433
<v Speaker 2>he sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sets up the kind of like heavy </v>

4215
03:28:39.221 --> 03:28:41.650
<v Speaker 2>conflict that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4216
03:28:41.770 --> 03:28:45.010
<v Speaker 2>the way people interact with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right is very.</v>

4217
03:28:45.100 --> 03:28:49.750
<v Speaker 2>The reactions are very dependent upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>the attitude that a person has when they</v>

4218
03:28:49.751 --> 03:28:51.790
<v Speaker 2>go into this interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4219
03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:54.100
<v Speaker 2>with two people meet on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>

4220
03:28:54.620 --> 03:28:58.840
<v Speaker 2>the one person meets that person says </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same words and they wind up hugging.</v>

4221
03:28:58.900 --> 03:29:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Another person meets that person and has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fistfight.</v>

4222
03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

4223
03:29:02.980 --> 03:29:03.940
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4224
03:29:03.941 --> 03:29:04.774
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of it is the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach people a lot of is the way you </v>

4225
03:29:07.660 --> 03:29:10.930
<v Speaker 2>accept people's ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you communicate with them,</v>

4226
03:29:10.931 --> 03:29:13.780
<v Speaker 2>the way you allow them to fully express </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves without judgment.</v>

4227
03:29:14.020 --> 03:29:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't buy any of that.</v>

4228
03:29:15.941 --> 03:29:16.774
<v Speaker 2>He feels like there's a war going on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to shut down religion as </v>

4229
03:29:19.661 --> 03:29:21.550
<v Speaker 2>quickly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing he wanted to.</v>

4230
03:29:24.520 --> 03:29:25.353
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to fashion a science into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cudgel that was maximally efficient for </v>

4231
03:29:31.300 --> 03:29:33.660
<v Speaker 2>beating the crap out of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way to put it.</v>

4232
03:29:33.661 --> 03:29:34.494
<v Speaker 2>And what Brett did is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually your scientific work goes in </v>

4233
03:29:38.021 --> 03:29:38.854
<v Speaker 2>the exact opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason I brought it up was it was </v>

4234
03:29:41.711 --> 03:29:46.300
<v Speaker 2>one of these unexpected occurrences that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a meeting of these things,</v>

4235
03:29:46.301 --> 03:29:47.134
<v Speaker 2>and this is your point about the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the mixed martial arts thing </v>

4236
03:29:49.861 --> 03:29:50.111
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4237
03:29:50.111 --> 03:29:51.970
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what's going to have.</v>

4238
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And gradually we came to understand that</v>

4239
03:29:57.011 --> 03:29:57.844
<v Speaker 2>there were certain systems that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper effective and that even those </v>

4240
03:30:00.131 --> 03:30:01.260
<v Speaker 2>could get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4241
03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:02.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were making the point earlier about </v>

4242
03:30:03.250 --> 03:30:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian Jujitsu didn't keep advancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4243
03:30:07.571 --> 03:30:08.404
<v Speaker 2>at the same level once we understood the</v>
<v Speaker 2>role of all of these different systems </v>

4244
03:30:11.861 --> 03:30:12.910
<v Speaker 2>and advancing fighting.</v>

4245
03:30:13.300 --> 03:30:14.133
<v Speaker 2>So the question that I'm having </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeatedly is what kept Brett and </v>

4246
03:30:17.291 --> 03:30:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

4247
03:30:18.940 --> 03:30:21.910
<v Speaker 2>from having that meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4248
03:30:22.450 --> 03:30:23.283
<v Speaker 2>where I think dawkins probably didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully understand what he was getting </v>

4249
03:30:25.811 --> 03:30:29.500
<v Speaker 2>into when he agreed to appear within </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theorist on stage.</v>

4250
03:30:30.130 --> 03:30:30.963
<v Speaker 2>But you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that he's just very confident </v>

4251
03:30:31.991 --> 03:30:33.850
<v Speaker 2>in his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very confident,</v>

4252
03:30:33.851 --> 03:30:34.684
<v Speaker 2>his intellectual capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing these types of debates </v>

4253
03:30:37.031 --> 03:30:41.960
<v Speaker 2>and shutting down these secular or these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are from various religions.</v>

4254
03:30:41.961 --> 03:30:42.441
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4255
03:30:42.441 --> 03:30:43.300
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4256
03:30:43.450 --> 03:30:46.220
<v Speaker 2>he's had these debates with people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism,</v>

4257
03:30:46.221 --> 03:30:49.130
<v Speaker 2>from Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has been as part of his career.</v>

4258
03:30:49.250 --> 03:30:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4259
03:30:49.870 --> 03:30:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even what the fuck's his name?</v>

4260
03:30:52.860 --> 03:30:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Indian fellow who,</v>

4261
03:30:55.731 --> 03:30:58.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody makes fun of,</v>

4262
03:30:58.850 --> 03:31:00.680
<v Speaker 2>what the Fuck's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dinesh D'souza?</v>

4263
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:01.543
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other guy,</v>

4264
03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:02.833
<v Speaker 2>the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4265
03:31:02.920 --> 03:31:05.840
<v Speaker 2>the quantum guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always using that guy,</v>

4266
03:31:06.620 --> 03:31:07.453
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is constantly using </v>

4267
03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:10.513
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate quantum words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throws quantum into fucking vegetable </v>

4268
03:31:14.181 --> 03:31:16.220
<v Speaker 2>soup and tries to make it to make sense.</v>

4269
03:31:16.410 --> 03:31:18.350
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used a lot of word salad,</v>

4270
03:31:18.670 --> 03:31:20.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

4271
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him debate him too.</v>

4272
03:31:22.900 --> 03:31:23.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you liked these videos of the fake </v>

4273
03:31:25.731 --> 03:31:27.950
<v Speaker 2>martial arts guys and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4274
03:31:28.060 --> 03:31:30.680
<v Speaker 2>they show up for the challenge because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've actually bought it.</v>

4275
03:31:31.210 --> 03:31:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Same with Dupo Depok.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4276
03:31:32.661 --> 03:31:34.070
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm trying to trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

4277
03:31:34.100 --> 03:31:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it interesting that in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who say,</v>

4278
03:31:38.650 --> 03:31:40.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration is a pure good.</v>

4279
03:31:40.730 --> 03:31:42.860
<v Speaker 2>There is no connection between Islam and</v>
<v Speaker 2>terror.</v>

4280
03:31:44.690 --> 03:31:47.090
<v Speaker 2>The only people who oppose a free </v>
<v Speaker 2>trader,</v>

4281
03:31:47.091 --> 03:31:47.924
<v Speaker 2>protectionist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people know enough not to want to </v>

4282
03:31:51.951 --> 03:31:55.670
<v Speaker 2>trounce us because what they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong.</v>

4283
03:31:55.820 --> 03:31:56.653
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're expert enough to know that </v>

4284
03:31:58.971 --> 03:31:59.804
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a secret five point </v>

4285
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:03.583
<v Speaker 2>exploding heart technique or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they know it's nonsense and so </v>

4286
03:32:06.981 --> 03:32:09.720
<v Speaker 2>they won't actually think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then why don't,</v>

4287
03:32:11.120 --> 03:32:12.020
<v Speaker 2>why don't they want in?</v>

4288
03:32:12.640 --> 03:32:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they,</v>

4289
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they necessarily do </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believe that they're wrong.</v>

4290
03:32:18.740 --> 03:32:19.573
<v Speaker 2>I do think that some of these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are like super progressive and </v>

4291
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:24.703
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very committed to some of these maybe </v>

4292
03:32:26.540 --> 03:32:30.680
<v Speaker 2>illogical positions on some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas are afraid of conflict though.</v>

4293
03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.843
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>why they shy towards progressivism </v>

4294
03:32:34.490 --> 03:32:37.010
<v Speaker 2>towards socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they let conflict.</v>

4295
03:32:37.580 --> 03:32:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4296
03:32:38.340 --> 03:32:38.610
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4297
03:32:38.610 --> 03:32:39.443
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to get together and scream at </v>

4298
03:32:40.281 --> 03:32:41.780
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they'd like to get,</v>

4299
03:32:41.800 --> 03:32:43.490
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get together in large groups.</v>

4300
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:44.663
<v Speaker 2>Say We know how you sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking racist you fucking piece of </v>

4301
03:32:47.211 --> 03:32:48.740
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one on one.</v>

4302
03:32:48.890 --> 03:32:49.723
<v Speaker 2>They're cowards it like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the type of person that would </v>

4303
03:32:53.001 --> 03:32:53.834
<v Speaker 2>think it's a good idea to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to show up and bang on someone's door </v>

4304
03:32:56.901 --> 03:32:58.160
<v Speaker 2>and scare them in their home.</v>

4305
03:32:58.340 --> 03:33:00.970
<v Speaker 2>That type of person is not the type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that would,</v>

4306
03:33:01.160 --> 03:33:01.993
<v Speaker 2>that looks forward to on an even </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield engaging someone one on one </v>

4307
03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:11.000
<v Speaker 2>and just just open communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what they're dealing with.</v>

4308
03:33:11.001 --> 03:33:12.530
<v Speaker 2>They're doing is trying to silence </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4309
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:14.420
<v Speaker 2>scare people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidate people.</v>

4310
03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:16.130
<v Speaker 2>They're bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual bullies.</v>

4311
03:33:16.280 --> 03:33:18.530
<v Speaker 2>People are bullies are almost always </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecure.</v>

4312
03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:19.393
<v Speaker 2>They're almost always scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why there's been very few </v>

4313
03:33:21.501 --> 03:33:25.710
<v Speaker 2>people that are jumping forward to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to go to intellectual war.</v>

4314
03:33:25.730 --> 03:33:30.730
<v Speaker 2>When Rachel maddow or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Linda Sarsour one in.</v>

4315
03:33:30.891 --> 03:33:31.724
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty.</v>

4316
03:33:32.240 --> 03:33:34.560
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with two very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of human beings.</v>

4317
03:33:34.561 --> 03:33:35.840
<v Speaker 2>So Rachel Maddow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing.</v>

4318
03:33:35.841 --> 03:33:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Linda Sarsour is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very seriously</v>

4319
03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:40.820
<v Speaker 3>religious person who's got some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4320
03:33:41.100 --> 03:33:41.933
<v Speaker 3>very deep beliefs as far as Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wears the hijab or she'd been just </v>

4321
03:33:45.601 --> 03:33:47.100
<v Speaker 3>as two totally different.</v>

4322
03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:48.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

4323
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:51.560
<v Speaker 1>But if I listed a group of people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the late night comedians,</v>

4324
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:55.190
<v Speaker 1>there's this very weird thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all seem to believe the same.</v>

4325
03:33:55.370 --> 03:33:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a secret meeting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they all agreed to a bunch of stuff that</v>

4326
03:33:58.341 --> 03:33:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4327
03:33:59.130 --> 03:34:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceedings.</v>

4328
03:34:00.980 --> 03:34:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how so?</v>

4329
03:34:02.660 --> 03:34:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that they all kind of know that the</v>

4330
03:34:05.181 --> 03:34:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Republicans are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all horrible.</v>

4331
03:34:06.891 --> 03:34:10.290
<v Speaker 1>The Democrats are basically good people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

4332
03:34:10.380 --> 03:34:13.730
<v Speaker 1>they all know that climate science is </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled science.</v>

4333
03:34:14.300 --> 03:34:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some that they have these pretty</v>

4334
03:34:18.321 --> 03:34:19.154
<v Speaker 1>much open borders are a great thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody who doesn't believe in </v>

4335
03:34:23.361 --> 03:34:27.770
<v Speaker 1>that is only so it's only not believing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because of xenophobia,</v>

4336
03:34:28.340 --> 03:34:29.173
<v Speaker 1>whatever these set of beliefs are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see these guys in open </v>

4337
03:34:33.620 --> 03:34:35.620
<v Speaker 1>discussion particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4338
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:37.550
<v Speaker 1>two hours long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4339
03:34:37.551 --> 03:34:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could,</v>

4340
03:34:39.360 --> 03:34:40.193
<v Speaker 1>could you get a Stephen Colbert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth Meyers in here and have a </v>

4341
03:34:44.871 --> 03:34:46.610
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guest is really.</v>

4342
03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4343
03:34:47.620 --> 03:34:49.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

4344
03:34:50.320 --> 03:34:51.153
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they'd be solid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're scared of having discussions </v>

4345
03:34:52.991 --> 03:34:55.910
<v Speaker 3>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I only see them in ovarian.</v>

4346
03:34:55.950 --> 03:34:58.540
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to be very measured because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could lose their job.</v>

4347
03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:01.000
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that simple.</v>

4348
03:35:01.270 --> 03:35:03.180
<v Speaker 3>They make a tremendous amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4349
03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:06.380
<v Speaker 3>If they came and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4350
03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:10.150
<v Speaker 3>anything that could be misconstrued or </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinterpreted,</v>

4351
03:35:10.510 --> 03:35:11.343
<v Speaker 3>even not even actually being something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually transphobic or </v>

4352
03:35:15.310 --> 03:35:16.143
<v Speaker 3>homophobic or actually xenophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they said anything that could be </v>

4353
03:35:18.971 --> 03:35:19.804
<v Speaker 3>taken out of context and put it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>small clip and then sent down and it </v>

4354
03:35:22.601 --> 03:35:25.360
<v Speaker 3>goes viral and they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Megan Kelly.</v>

4355
03:35:25.660 --> 03:35:30.660
<v Speaker 3>Megan Kelly had a question about why </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't you wear makeup to look like Diana</v>

4356
03:35:31.960 --> 03:35:32.793
<v Speaker 3>Ross?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't you?</v>

4357
03:35:32.860 --> 03:35:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some good reasons why you can't.</v>

4358
03:35:34.541 --> 03:35:36.610
<v Speaker 3>There's some good racial history behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>blackface.</v>

4359
03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:37.593
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it that she can't even ask a </v>

4360
03:35:40.181 --> 03:35:42.310
<v Speaker 3>question without losing her job?</v>

4361
03:35:42.310 --> 03:35:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it pulled up blog Kute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to make a fucking statement.</v>

4362
03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:50.050
<v Speaker 3>We have bore violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for exactly what you said about,</v>

4363
03:35:50.170 --> 03:35:51.003
<v Speaker 3>about the whole Kung Fu thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is only can exist in a protected </v>

4364
03:35:54.221 --> 03:35:55.630
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4365
03:35:56.020 --> 03:35:56.853
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone like Megan Kelly can only exist </v>

4366
03:35:59.351 --> 03:36:02.680
<v Speaker 3>in a protected contest with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people protected contest.</v>

4367
03:36:02.681 --> 03:36:03.514
<v Speaker 3>Even Cole bear is got to be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fastest minds on the planet that </v>

4368
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.983
<v Speaker 3>everybody I know who's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's done his show says he just thinks </v>

4369
03:36:09.821 --> 03:36:10.900
<v Speaker 3>faster than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4370
03:36:10.901 --> 03:36:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's a very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

4371
03:36:14.480 --> 03:36:16.710
<v Speaker 3>But he's also a Catholic devout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4372
03:36:17.330 --> 03:36:18.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

4373
03:36:18.370 --> 03:36:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Does this bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bothers me.</v>

4374
03:36:21.320 --> 03:36:23.350
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me as an organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>of kid fuckers.</v>

4375
03:36:24.100 --> 03:36:24.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how come he's not speaking out </v>

4376
03:36:25.811 --> 03:36:28.640
<v Speaker 3>against all those kids getting fucked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4377
03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:31.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was raised Catholic,</v>

4378
03:36:31.961 --> 03:36:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not saying that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that the people,</v>

4379
03:36:34.301 --> 03:36:36.490
<v Speaker 3>he knows our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a giant</v>

4380
03:36:36.580 --> 03:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>problem with that organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

4381
03:36:38.730 --> 03:36:39.563
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what's bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's not bothered with what I want to </v>

4382
03:36:44.321 --> 03:36:45.154
<v Speaker 2>make sure that we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're about to talk past each </v>

4383
03:36:47.111 --> 03:36:48.010
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I want to bring it back.</v>

4384
03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just gave me an answer.</v>

4385
03:36:52.480 --> 03:36:56.330
<v Speaker 2>He can't appear in this kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>context because that might come up</v>

4386
03:36:58.310 --> 03:37:01.550
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needs to be in a world with much more</v>

4387
03:37:01.551 --> 03:37:05.120
<v Speaker 2>restricted rules where someone can't say</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an organization of kid fucker.</v>

4388
03:37:05.130 --> 03:37:06.350
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4389
03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:11.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just more restricted world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the reason why that has been</v>

4390
03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:13.873
<v Speaker 2>able to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm trying to get that </v>

4391
03:37:15.241 --> 03:37:16.074
<v Speaker 2>people don't talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is the idea that this is such a </v>

4392
03:37:19.730 --> 03:37:20.563
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your point about Akita was if you </v>

4393
03:37:22.281 --> 03:37:25.340
<v Speaker 2>happen to be unarmed and attacked by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man with a sword,</v>

4394
03:37:25.341 --> 03:37:28.560
<v Speaker 2>this might have some value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have some value of someone that</v>

4395
03:37:28.561 --> 03:37:31.020
<v Speaker 2>attacked you in a very specific way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't understand what the key.</v>

4396
03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:34.870
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted rule set on which to fight.</v>

4397
03:37:35.190 --> 03:37:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now maybe what you just said to me,</v>

4398
03:37:37.970 --> 03:37:38.803
<v Speaker 2>which could open this whole thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all of these people can only </v>

4399
03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:43.633
<v Speaker 2>apply their ability to have a back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth of ideas if the rules are heavily </v>

4400
03:37:49.611 --> 03:37:50.444
<v Speaker 2>restricted.</v>

4401
03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

4402
03:37:52.281 --> 03:37:53.114
<v Speaker 2>I think they could do it in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all of them are operating under </v>

4403
03:37:57.681 --> 03:38:00.320
<v Speaker 2>this rule system because this rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is how they get paid.</v>

4404
03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.510
<v Speaker 2>But I think Seth Meyers a very smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

4405
03:38:02.511 --> 03:38:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I know Jimmy Kimmel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very smart guy.</v>

4406
03:38:04.611 --> 03:38:06.950
<v Speaker 2>They can do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could do a podcast.</v>

4407
03:38:06.951 --> 03:38:09.920
<v Speaker 2>He could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could operate into any in any genre I</v>

4408
03:38:09.921 --> 03:38:10.754
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I would imagine the same </v>

4409
03:38:11.961 --> 03:38:15.620
<v Speaker 2>with [inaudible] I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think Jimmy Fallon st thing,</v>

4410
03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:16.753
<v Speaker 2>but when they're forced into that box </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is 100 million dollar a year </v>

4411
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:20.661
<v Speaker 2>box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4412
03:38:20.661 --> 03:38:21.494
<v Speaker 2>it feels good and that box was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>velvet walls and you get to drive a fat </v>

4413
03:38:24.831 --> 03:38:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes and live in Beverly Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4414
03:38:26.910 --> 03:38:31.910
<v Speaker 2>did you decide to stay in that box?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe their mind is in that box.</v>

4415
03:38:32.901 --> 03:38:33.734
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's not any restriction for </v>

4416
03:38:36.351 --> 03:38:38.570
<v Speaker 2>them at all because this is how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate all the time.</v>

4417
03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:43.600
<v Speaker 2>So I did the show with a Jordan and Ben </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shapiro on Dave's a set right before Ben</v>

4418
03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:47.293
<v Speaker 2>Wind on real time with Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ben was kind of excited to do bill </v>

4419
03:38:50.871 --> 03:38:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Maher and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4420
03:38:52.041 --> 03:38:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's going to rough me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to be a gentleman.</v>

4421
03:38:55.461 --> 03:38:58.910
<v Speaker 2>I think he's one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when ben sat down with bill,</v>

4422
03:38:58.911 --> 03:38:59.744
<v Speaker 2>we saw this thing that was very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were sort of hoping because bill is </v>

4423
03:39:03.291 --> 03:39:04.124
<v Speaker 2>kind of the most towards us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anybody in that kind of mainstream </v>

4424
03:39:07.161 --> 03:39:09.650
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I saw,</v>

4425
03:39:09.680 --> 03:39:14.660
<v Speaker 2>which I hadn't really appreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that bill was not doing this kind of</v>

4426
03:39:14.661 --> 03:39:15.494
<v Speaker 2>open discussion thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of his tone was leading like </v>

4427
03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:21.140
<v Speaker 2>surely you're not going to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>

4428
03:39:21.980 --> 03:39:26.980
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just purely saying are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that it was all of this emotional</v>

4429
03:39:27.291 --> 03:39:29.180
<v Speaker 2>instruction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4430
03:39:29.330 --> 03:39:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And it was clear to me that when I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben on that in that context,</v>

4431
03:39:36.320 --> 03:39:37.153
<v Speaker 2>that there were only a few hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>separating the two appearances and that </v>

4432
03:39:40.791 --> 03:39:41.624
<v Speaker 2>the characteristics of that environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're builds show is the most like </v>

4433
03:39:44.901 --> 03:39:48.320
<v Speaker 2>this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's just too different.</v>

4434
03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:50.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really the same ecosystem.</v>

4435
03:39:50.961 --> 03:39:51.794
<v Speaker 2>And you couldn't have an open debate </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless it cuts off after seven minutes </v>

4436
03:39:55.581 --> 03:39:56.414
<v Speaker 2>and the host is in control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well bill doesn't have any time that </v>

4437
03:39:59.090 --> 03:40:00.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the problem.</v>

4438
03:40:00.650 --> 03:40:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Part of the terms of they have a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted format.</v>

4439
03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:08.360
<v Speaker 2>He was doing a conversation with Steve </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bannon and he was on Sam Harris' podcast</v>

4440
03:40:08.361 --> 03:40:09.194
<v Speaker 2>and he was talking about it and he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one of the problems was he got to </v>

4441
03:40:11.001 --> 03:40:14.060
<v Speaker 2>this point where like I was wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask him more stuff,</v>

4442
03:40:14.061 --> 03:40:16.430
<v Speaker 2>but I ran out of time and I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4443
03:40:16.431 --> 03:40:17.264
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck kind of ancient system are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you operating under that you run out of </v>

4444
03:40:21.111 --> 03:40:21.950
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's take.</v>

4445
03:40:22.010 --> 03:40:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's take him at his word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4446
03:40:23.450 --> 03:40:24.283
<v Speaker 2>he definitely did run out of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I assume that that's true and so </v>

4447
03:40:25.951 --> 03:40:27.500
<v Speaker 2>that Bill Maher said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

4448
03:40:27.501 --> 03:40:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>

4449
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I want the following situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to continue to do realtime in the</v>

4450
03:40:30.981 --> 03:40:31.814
<v Speaker 2>same format that it's always been done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to have a podcast like Rogan </v>

4451
03:40:35.420 --> 03:40:36.253
<v Speaker 2>where we take as much time as we need </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think those two things play </v>

4452
03:40:39.111 --> 03:40:40.220
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4453
03:40:40.221 --> 03:40:41.760
<v Speaker 2>they're fine together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4454
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I feared that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not.</v>

4455
03:40:44.570 --> 03:40:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

4456
03:40:45.501 --> 03:40:46.334
<v Speaker 2>He went on Sam's podcast and I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed him more than I enjoy him on </v>

4457
03:40:49.311 --> 03:40:50.144
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know because he had chances didn't </v>

4458
03:40:51.351 --> 03:40:53.360
<v Speaker 2>look the same way on Dave Rubin show </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

4459
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:56.420
<v Speaker 2>He looked totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I didn't say it?</v>

4460
03:40:56.540 --> 03:40:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to see it.</v>

4461
03:40:57.770 --> 03:40:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4462
03:40:58.941 --> 03:41:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Tucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4463
03:41:01.010 --> 03:41:01.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having my own weird issues where I </v>

4464
03:41:03.321 --> 03:41:04.154
<v Speaker 2>used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my previous position was that Fox News </v>

4465
03:41:06.231 --> 03:41:09.420
<v Speaker 2>is just propaganda and that Tucker was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that old car,</v>

4466
03:41:09.500 --> 03:41:10.333
<v Speaker 2>a crossfire situation way back when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tucker was like opening up as a </v>

4467
03:41:15.501 --> 03:41:17.510
<v Speaker 2>different person saying you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>

4468
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:19.760
<v Speaker 2>You're the new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still stuck in the old.</v>

4469
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must really feel that.</v>

4470
03:41:21.140 --> 03:41:23.330
<v Speaker 2>You must really feel like he is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4471
03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:27.710
<v Speaker 2>that is what you have to do if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive on Fox News.</v>

4472
03:41:27.711 --> 03:41:30.320
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a velvet coffin.</v>

4473
03:41:30.620 --> 03:41:32.240
<v Speaker 2>You're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful.</v>

4474
03:41:32.250 --> 03:41:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting paid shit.</v>

4475
03:41:33.861 --> 03:41:34.694
<v Speaker 2>Loads of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't necessarily have the </v>

4476
03:41:36.831 --> 03:41:38.090
<v Speaker 2>freedom to express.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4477
03:41:38.091 --> 03:41:39.370
<v Speaker 2>you don't have long form freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4478
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:40.543
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have the freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely express yourself across the </v>

4479
03:41:43.221 --> 03:41:44.480
<v Speaker 2>border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could.</v>

4480
03:41:44.530 --> 03:41:46.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't look at the left's ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

4481
03:41:46.521 --> 03:41:47.354
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the idea of universal </v>

4482
03:41:48.141 --> 03:41:48.974
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the idea of universal </v>

4483
03:41:50.241 --> 03:41:51.074
<v Speaker 2>basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the idea of paying for </v>

4484
03:41:53.151 --> 03:41:55.790
<v Speaker 2>people's school job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you and I actually have a really</v>

4485
03:41:55.791 --> 03:42:00.410
<v Speaker 2>interesting difference of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your opinion is there is nothing</v>

4486
03:42:00.411 --> 03:42:01.244
<v Speaker 2>preventing you from staying in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>velvet coffin and doing this style of </v>

4487
03:42:04.161 --> 03:42:04.994
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

4488
03:42:05.090 --> 03:42:06.500
<v Speaker 2>And my guest is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

4489
03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm only saying that with Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Tucker Carlson probably can't do</v>

4490
03:42:10.251 --> 03:42:11.084
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of Tucker Carlson left colby or </v>

4491
03:42:12.471 --> 03:42:13.610
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4492
03:42:13.880 --> 03:42:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he could.</v>

4493
03:42:15.741 --> 03:42:16.574
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he would though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he out of all of them and I </v>

4494
03:42:18.891 --> 03:42:20.600
<v Speaker 2>think he's brilliant and don't get me </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

4495
03:42:20.601 --> 03:42:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm what I said he's from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4496
03:42:21.770 --> 03:42:23.820
<v Speaker 2>an organization of kid fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4497
03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:25.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4498
03:42:25.220 --> 03:42:27.180
<v Speaker 2>but he's a part of the cabinet you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

4499
03:42:27.650 --> 03:42:29.530
<v Speaker 2>You could do any one of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all bright.</v>

4500
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you think is a big thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big thing</v>

4501
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:33.450
<v Speaker 3>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

4502
03:42:33.451 --> 03:42:34.284
<v Speaker 3>the actual reality of the organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what they've done to protect people </v>

4503
03:42:37.291 --> 03:42:39.420
<v Speaker 3>that have molested children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unprecedented,</v>

4504
03:42:39.530 --> 03:42:40.363
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also something that I was raised </v>

4505
03:42:41.701 --> 03:42:42.990
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was Catholic.</v>

4506
03:42:42.991 --> 03:42:43.824
<v Speaker 3>I went to Catholic school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that he wants to do that </v>

4507
03:42:48.931 --> 03:42:53.670
<v Speaker 3>sort of wild country open type Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

4508
03:42:53.671 --> 03:42:54.504
<v Speaker 3>I think he enjoys wearing a tie and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a straight up talk show like the </v>

4509
03:42:59.310 --> 03:43:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Carson show or the Jay Leno show </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think he's a very,</v>

4510
03:43:01.531 --> 03:43:03.300
<v Speaker 3>very good at it and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's anything wrong with that.</v>

4511
03:43:03.301 --> 03:43:05.940
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people like that France</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I understand that,</v>

4512
03:43:05.941 --> 03:43:07.680
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong.</v>

4513
03:43:07.681 --> 03:43:08.514
<v Speaker 3>I'm just assuming I could do different </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what a what an action that if you </v>

4514
03:43:12.781 --> 03:43:16.830
<v Speaker 3>tried to do both of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will be revealed.</v>

4515
03:43:17.130 --> 03:43:21.780
<v Speaker 3>You'd be caught between two worlds where</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I see what you're saying,</v>

4516
03:43:21.840 --> 03:43:22.673
<v Speaker 3>like I actually think that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideas would collapse just the way </v>

4517
03:43:27.170 --> 03:43:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Kung Fu collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're probably right.</v>

4518
03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I think if you had two people having </v>
<v Speaker 3>these conversations in long form,</v>

4519
03:43:34.441 --> 03:43:35.274
<v Speaker 3>instead of those CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a three windows where they're just </v>

4520
03:43:38.850 --> 03:43:41.740
<v Speaker 3>battling it out for six minutes and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4521
03:43:41.790 --> 03:43:42.623
<v Speaker 3>everybody's yelling over everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the single worst way to argue </v>

4522
03:43:46.381 --> 03:43:48.540
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no gracie challenge.</v>

4523
03:43:49.200 --> 03:43:50.033
<v Speaker 3>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Jordan Peterson is kind of doing </v>

4524
03:43:51.421 --> 03:43:54.150
<v Speaker 3>his own grave challenge that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender.</v>

4525
03:43:54.450 --> 03:43:56.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's the only one they want.</v>

4526
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4527
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:59.583
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I think a puzzle hoists Gracie </v>

4528
03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:01.913
<v Speaker 3>of the intellectual.</v>

4529
03:44:05.460 --> 03:44:08.000
<v Speaker 3>He's out there tapping wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4530
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.903
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think I'm not legitimately now </v>

4531
03:44:12.540 --> 03:44:13.373
<v Speaker 3>he's worked his way past the Kung Fu </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and he's now onto like a Olympic </v>

4532
03:44:16.381 --> 03:44:18.880
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're throwing at him this,</v>

4533
03:44:18.881 --> 03:44:19.714
<v Speaker 3>this latest one was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is much better than Kathy Newman </v>

4534
03:44:22.621 --> 03:44:23.454
<v Speaker 3>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't make any of these ridiculous </v>

4535
03:44:25.351 --> 03:44:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Straw man arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

4536
03:44:26.940 --> 03:44:29.340
<v Speaker 3>she came at him with her positions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>our points.</v>

4537
03:44:29.700 --> 03:44:30.533
<v Speaker 3>It was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're saying is true for </v>

4538
03:44:33.571 --> 03:44:34.404
<v Speaker 3>everybody except Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Bill Maher would hold his </v>

4539
03:44:37.771 --> 03:44:38.604
<v Speaker 3>positions in podcast form and I think he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just have more time to expand on </v>

4540
03:44:42.181 --> 03:44:45.040
<v Speaker 3>them and I base this on him being on Sam</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris,</v>

4541
03:44:45.041 --> 03:44:49.680
<v Speaker 3>his show and I find it to be very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the 10th anniversary of religious</v>

4542
03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:52.530
<v Speaker 3>and he was excellent on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he could do it,</v>

4543
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:53.850
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's also.</v>

4544
03:44:53.850 --> 03:44:55.200
<v Speaker 3>He can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

4545
03:44:55.320 --> 03:44:59.250
<v Speaker 3>He got in trouble for dropping in n bomb</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his show in a joking for him.</v>

4546
03:44:59.251 --> 03:45:00.084
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a different cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is very different with </v>

4547
03:45:02.131 --> 03:45:03.180
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on Hbo,</v>

4548
03:45:03.210 --> 03:45:06.180
<v Speaker 3>but when Ice Cube came to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

4549
03:45:06.540 --> 03:45:07.373
<v Speaker 3>It was painful to me because I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive that he had a Carlin style </v>

4550
03:45:10.171 --> 03:45:11.004
<v Speaker 3>attitude about that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's tough because in this </v>

4551
03:45:14.611 --> 03:45:16.110
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

4552
03:45:16.260 --> 03:45:17.093
<v Speaker 3>that's where he makes his living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He butters his bread over at HBO and if </v>

4553
03:45:19.471 --> 03:45:20.304
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to have a long form </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with that guy even on a </v>

4554
03:45:22.081 --> 03:45:25.440
<v Speaker 3>podcast and he didn't have an hbo show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing,</v>

4555
03:45:25.441 --> 03:45:26.274
<v Speaker 3>but if you do have an hbo show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a totally different </v>

4556
03:45:28.681 --> 03:45:30.030
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One</v>

4557
03:45:30.040 --> 03:45:32.440
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're walking a tightrope,</v>

4558
03:45:32.470 --> 03:45:33.303
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I'm trying to get at is</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we're too dangerous in some </v>

4559
03:45:36.311 --> 03:45:40.510
<v Speaker 2>sense to play with because the velvet </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

4560
03:45:40.540 --> 03:45:41.373
<v Speaker 2>He's asked to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to bill and I actually went </v>

4561
03:45:44.141 --> 03:45:45.850
<v Speaker 2>back and forth on an email about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

4562
03:45:46.460 --> 03:45:47.720
<v Speaker 2>I dropped the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

4563
03:45:47.770 --> 03:45:50.320
<v Speaker 2>he would do anybody's podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case.</v>

4564
03:45:50.590 --> 03:45:51.423
<v Speaker 2>He could do his own podcast as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree that he would be the one most </v>

4565
03:45:54.311 --> 03:45:56.200
<v Speaker 2>likely to be able to do both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could do it.</v>

4566
03:45:56.270 --> 03:45:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could do it.</v>

4567
03:45:57.370 --> 03:46:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I think all of them could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Seth Meyers could do it too.</v>

4568
03:46:00.101 --> 03:46:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I think Jimmy Kimmel could probably do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as good or better than any of them.</v>

4569
03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy absolutely could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4570
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:09.100
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that's holding him back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a man of his ideas.</v>

4571
03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:10.120
<v Speaker 2>He's not gonna.</v>

4572
03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:10.953
<v Speaker 2>He's probably the least likely to alter </v>
<v Speaker 2>or manipulate his ideas of anybody </v>

4573
03:46:15.521 --> 03:46:17.440
<v Speaker 2>that's ever done one of those late night</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk show host.</v>

4574
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:18.783
<v Speaker 2>He's just operating inside a format </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you don't swear and you have a </v>

4575
03:46:22.391 --> 03:46:25.540
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of time and you try to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny and you say insightful stuff,</v>

4576
03:46:25.810 --> 03:46:28.780
<v Speaker 2>but he's a very ethical guy and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also a very,</v>

4577
03:46:28.781 --> 03:46:29.614
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy and he's also very rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a shitload of fuck you money </v>

4578
03:46:32.970 --> 03:46:33.803
<v Speaker 2>and I think Jimmy Kimmel do it easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people could do it </v>

4579
03:46:35.921 --> 03:46:37.240
<v Speaker 2>easily and I think they're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

4580
03:46:37.660 --> 03:46:38.493
<v Speaker 2>I think some some point along the line </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to realize that the </v>

4581
03:46:41.420 --> 03:46:43.360
<v Speaker 2>restrictions that they're operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>

4582
03:46:43.361 --> 03:46:46.330
<v Speaker 2>unless they really enjoy that format,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think those formats are going to</v>

4583
03:46:46.331 --> 03:46:47.164
<v Speaker 2>be there that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those formats are a lot like </v>

4584
03:46:48.851 --> 03:46:51.550
<v Speaker 2>sitcoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're slowly starting to vanish.</v>

4585
03:46:51.820 --> 03:46:52.653
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for every one the Roseanne show that </v>

4586
03:46:54.131 --> 03:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of nostalgic and you know,</v>

4587
03:46:56.300 --> 03:46:57.133
<v Speaker 2>that runs into its own disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many new sitcoms are there that </v>

4588
03:46:59.771 --> 03:47:01.210
<v Speaker 2>everybody's aware of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

4589
03:47:01.211 --> 03:47:03.070
<v Speaker 2>It used to be every time there was a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom,</v>

4590
03:47:03.071 --> 03:47:05.680
<v Speaker 2>whether it was friends or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>

4591
03:47:05.710 --> 03:47:06.543
<v Speaker 2>whatever the show Seinfeld there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was talking about these new </v>

4592
03:47:08.921 --> 03:47:09.754
<v Speaker 2>sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody fucking talks about sitcoms </v>

4593
03:47:12.341 --> 03:47:13.174
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>

4594
03:47:13.470 --> 03:47:16.360
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing I took on this morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter,</v>

4595
03:47:17.080 --> 03:47:17.913
<v Speaker 2>which was a Dave Rubin and Bret </v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein and myself were talking about </v>

4596
03:47:22.361 --> 03:47:27.361
<v Speaker 2>this phenomena of very high follower </v>
<v Speaker 2>counts with cycle low engagement.</v>

4597
03:47:28.930 --> 03:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fake.</v>

4598
03:47:30.220 --> 03:47:32.350
<v Speaker 2>But those are fake followers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>

4599
03:47:32.380 --> 03:47:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be,</v>

4600
03:47:33.490 --> 03:47:34.323
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's very interesting that we're </v>

4601
03:47:35.921 --> 03:47:36.754
<v Speaker 2>talking about getting rid of visible </v>
<v Speaker 2>follower counts and getting rid of </v>

4602
03:47:40.001 --> 03:47:40.600
<v Speaker 2>likes.</v>

4603
03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Who's saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4604
03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:42.993
<v Speaker 2>apparently there's discussion about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack May have floated some trial </v>

4605
03:47:45.731 --> 03:47:49.780
<v Speaker 2>balloons that twitter is going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve the level of conversation and by</v>

4606
03:47:49.781 --> 03:47:50.614
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of follower counts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>removing likes can imagine thinking </v>

4607
03:47:54.470 --> 03:47:55.303
<v Speaker 2>you're going to improve the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation by getting rid of a heart </v>

4608
03:47:58.570 --> 03:48:00.680
<v Speaker 2>that you can switch it on someone's Id.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Art,</v>

4609
03:48:01.330 --> 03:48:03.570
<v Speaker 2>it's literally a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's feedback.</v>

4610
03:48:03.620 --> 03:48:04.453
<v Speaker 2>You're clicking on a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on instagram and on twitter it's a </v>

4611
03:48:06.521 --> 03:48:07.570
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4612
03:48:08.540 --> 03:48:10.090
<v Speaker 2>here's your little heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>

4613
03:48:10.470 --> 03:48:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get rid of love Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

4614
03:48:12.641 --> 03:48:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to get rid of love,</v>

4615
03:48:15.690 --> 03:48:17.530
<v Speaker 2>terrifying human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

4616
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:19.330
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's terrifying about it?</v>

4617
03:48:19.380 --> 03:48:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm seeing you blowing kisses in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my general direction.</v>

4618
03:48:22.001 --> 03:48:22.834
<v Speaker 2>I'm remembering all the videos I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched where you attack some sort of a </v>

4619
03:48:25.121 --> 03:48:28.180
<v Speaker 2>punching bag with this vicious spinning </v>
<v Speaker 2>elbow or something.</v>

4620
03:48:28.180 --> 03:48:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4621
03:48:29.580 --> 03:48:31.880
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about ideas here.</v>

4622
03:48:31.881 --> 03:48:32.930
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4623
03:48:33.020 --> 03:48:33.853
<v Speaker 2>I want to get out on that stuff later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have a midlife crisis with </v>

4624
03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:39.020
<v Speaker 2>some instruction for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we got to end this.</v>

4625
03:48:39.410 --> 03:48:41.690
<v Speaker 2>We've done four hours and 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

4626
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I to show you what they said though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was just a couple of weeks ago.</v>

4627
03:48:45.300 --> 03:48:46.133
<v Speaker 2>We've been saying for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are rethinking everything about the </v>

4628
03:48:48.861 --> 03:48:49.694
<v Speaker 2>service to ensure we are incentivizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy conversation that includes the </v>

4629
03:48:53.450 --> 03:48:54.283
<v Speaker 2>like button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are in the early stages of the work </v>

4630
03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:58.363
<v Speaker 2>and have no plans to share right now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is in response to telegraph the </v>

4631
03:49:03.801 --> 03:49:04.634
<v Speaker 2>Telegraph saying twitter to remove the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tool in a bid to improve the quality of </v>

4632
03:49:07.611 --> 03:49:08.444
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think something really weird is going </v>

4633
03:49:09.591 --> 03:49:10.424
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the quality of debate and by </v>

4634
03:49:11.601 --> 03:49:13.850
<v Speaker 2>whose definition I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not gonna you're.</v>

4635
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:17.330
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely not going to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people interact with each other.</v>

4636
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:18.583
<v Speaker 2>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People interact with each other because </v>

4637
03:49:19.971 --> 03:49:22.550
<v Speaker 2>they're anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have incentive to talk shit.</v>

4638
03:49:22.580 --> 03:49:23.480
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4639
03:49:23.481 --> 03:49:24.314
<v Speaker 2>so the one thing I could ask you as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>close this thing out is if we could </v>

4640
03:49:27.381 --> 03:49:29.930
<v Speaker 2>plug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not only my twitter,</v>

4641
03:49:29.931 --> 03:49:33.650
<v Speaker 2>which is my main thing that I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to diversify into instagram and youtube.</v>

4642
03:49:33.651 --> 03:49:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Should I get shut off twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you worried about getting shut off?</v>

4643
03:49:37.190 --> 03:49:38.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm always worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't say anything inflammatory </v>

4644
03:49:39.620 --> 03:49:42.320
<v Speaker 2>like would you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very logical and reasonable guy,</v>

4645
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:45.740
<v Speaker 2>so you think it's really gotten to that </v>

4648
03:49:49.401 --> 03:49:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I have more of a risk because the things</v>
