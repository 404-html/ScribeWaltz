<v Speaker 1>a picture.</v>

21
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And the Reebok people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ask Rhonda for a picture.</v>

22
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

24
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:50.160

58
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.640

<v Speaker 1>you know anti Rhonda,</v>

59
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but Rhonda is just ripped her a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

60
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be on team Rhonda for</v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

61
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've never been on t Rhonda.</v>

62
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

63
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>All or none because we have to assume</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's evolved.</v>

64
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the best I think I've seen</v>

65
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>her look so I have to assume like she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be better than that even.</v>

66
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you have goals as far as like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do with the title?</v>

67
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long do you want to hold it?</v>

68
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:25.461
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any thoughts in mind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be opponents like is getting Rhonda</v>

69
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>back in the Octagon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

70
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need that.</v>

71
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Like that has to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important to me and I have</v>

72
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Amanda had to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not want to look pastor because</v>

73
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>they think that would be a huge mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not one that I want to make as a</v>

74
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>veteran in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a rookie move.</v>

75
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.641
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

76
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>in the back of my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

77
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>like the fight with Ronda is something I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to happen and you don't know when</v>

78
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>it will happen.</v>

79
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It could be anticipated for November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that be tossed around in the</v>

80
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>UFC that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's planning on coming back and maybe</v>

81
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it might be Madison Square Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be great.</v>

82
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus on Amanda,</v>

83
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>but I know in the back of my mind and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

84
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I want that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want that to happen.</v>

85
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so important to me in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>career to go and beat Ronda and prove</v>

86
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been an underdog in most of my</v>

87
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been the person that people have</v>

88
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>always counted out in my entire career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my entire life.</v>

89
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Most people are telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

90
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>

91
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

92
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

93
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly fine with that.</v>

94
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I am at the best point in my career and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda is at the worst.</v>

95
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going through what I've already</v>

96
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>been through time and time again and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have built myself back up from that</v>

97
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and time again.</v>

98
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I know that I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confident in that.</v>

99
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Here I am standing the strongest that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever stood and I've already been</v>

100
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already been head kicked and</v>

101
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened to me before.</v>

102
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I picked myself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pull myself up by my bootstraps,</v>

103
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>but one for back in front of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worked.</v>

104
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Got My strike first world title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost that you're on to pick myself</v>

105
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one funder for the other got back on</v>

106
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fought,</v>

107
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>fought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought,</v>

108
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>fought Ronda again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The EOC was devastated,</v>

109
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought my world was just falling down</v>

110
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to an end cap.</v>

111
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Pekka put one foot in front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other gal back on the horse.</v>

112
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And now here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world champion.</v>

113
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I'm tough.</v>

114
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I know that I have what it takes to beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronda.</v>

115
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Many people don't believe that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

116
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been in this position before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many be,</v>

117
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>most people didn't think I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be holly.</v>

118
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>He most people didn't think he was gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat Ronda.</v>

119
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to me what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think.</v>

120
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>It matters what I believe and what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

121
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question mark is what,</v>

122
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>how is Rhonda going to come back from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

123
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I know what I've been hearing from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda in the media and the press.</v>

124
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been a little quiet lately,</v>

125
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but before that it wasn't what I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have expected to hear from someone who</v>

126
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>really wants to come back and who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

127
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>really a fighter at the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a great athlete.</v>

128
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>She's a great fighter.</v>

129
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>She's accomplished a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit where credit's due,</v>

130
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give her a round of applause for</v>

131
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>everything she's been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish.</v>

132
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I've ever lost in my career,</v>

133
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I went bananas to get back in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballistic.</v>

134
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to like right now,</v>

135
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>just like holly was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

136
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:12.660
<v Speaker 1>when do you want to fight again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like tomorrow against Meesha.</v>

137
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Now that's what you want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone has a devastating loss,</v>

138
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>they want to get back in there right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and face that person right now or,</v>

139
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>or someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get that loss of the record.</v>

140
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Erase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I lost the cat Zingano,</v>

141
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freaked out.</v>

142
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I called Sean Shelby and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me another fight right now.</v>

143
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nose isn't even heal.</v>

144
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

145
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I wanna fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it now.</v>

146
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I want to know when it's coming up like</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now or I'm going to freak out.</v>

147
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to lose my shit if I don't</v>

148
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>have like a fight on the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose it.</v>

149
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.640
<v Speaker 1>And then I hear Rhonda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

150
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a year off and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

151
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this.</v>

152
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

153
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't sound like someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really wants this anymore.</v>

154
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think that fight might've broker</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be wrong,</v>

155
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think something inside of her is</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than it was before.</v>

156
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's not broken,</v>

157
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's different because how much do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of factor</v>

158
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.330
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of a factor do you think</v>

159
00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:12.780
<v Speaker 2>success is in the park in terms of she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing movies.</v>

160
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.920
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

161
00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:15.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the darling of all these late night</v>

162
00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:18.160
<v Speaker 2>television shows and everybody wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang out with her.</v>

163
00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Is doing these commercials with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.050
<v Speaker 2>seth rogen on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of a factor is that?</v>

165
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she asked the curity,</v>

166
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>now she has job security outside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>FCC.</v>

167
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't really need that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think maybe that's also something</v>

168
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>on her mind is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does she really want this?</v>

169
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Because winning is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

170
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you win,</v>

171
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody supports you.</v>

172
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's on your train.</v>

173
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>When you lose fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>

174
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>And only the people that really love</v>
<v Speaker 1>your still really,</v>

175
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>really there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else was just like,</v>

176
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

177
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 1>That's loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the social media,</v>

178
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white nights that come out and want to</v>

179
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>tell you what a piece of shit you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how you're never going to accomplish</v>

180
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>anything and you'll never win another</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

181
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 1>And you might as well just quit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>retire,</v>

182
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

183
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>See those people and you have to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

184
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

185
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my choice has always been the,</v>

186
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

187
00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep fighting,</v>

188
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

189
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>and it just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't recognize,</v>

190
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things I recognize in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronda that I can,</v>

191
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I can recognize her greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can recognize,</v>

192
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her championship.</v>

193
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I can recognize things I don't identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that I don't identify with sitting</v>

194
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>on that loss for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot understand it.</v>

195
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>If it was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have eaten me alive inside and</v>

196
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tend to,</v>

197
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be making a movie.</v>

198
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:37.421
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

199
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:38.254
<v Speaker 1>it would just,</v>

200
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 2>but did she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she has a choice.</v>

201
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>I think if you have movie contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to fulfill them.</v>

202
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

203
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.930
<v Speaker 1>it is conor have to show up for showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up or press conferences is one thing,</v>

204
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she could've,</v>

205
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.170
<v Speaker 1>she could've fought because they said</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had anticipated for her to come</v>

206
00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 1>back at UFC 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted that and they,</v>

207
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.300
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Dana said she could have,</v>

208
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but should she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could have,</v>

209
00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but should she,</v>

210
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that could have and should,</v>

211
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 2>she was because she had to do a movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>for three months.</v>

212
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.470
<v Speaker 2>So like doing the movie for three months</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have taken three months outside of</v>

213
00:08:13.471 --> 00:08:15.400
<v Speaker 2>our camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've done a movie before,</v>

214
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:17.290
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like you're on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>set all day,</v>

215
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.750
<v Speaker 2>16 hour days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's long and grueling.</v>

216
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:20.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to train.</v>

217
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after a loss like that,</v>

218
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I think you really have to have enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to actually focus in then on top of</v>

219
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 2>that to getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting flatlined like that.</v>

220
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

221
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 2>some time to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You recover your head.</v>

222
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

223
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know if a year that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that would crush me.</v>

224
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to do what she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing right now.</v>

225
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't physically be able to like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with that for your and,</v>

226
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.160
<v Speaker 1>and if I had to think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat me alive,</v>

227
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.700
<v Speaker 1>like I think I'd be so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm pretty sure it's eating her</v>

228
00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 1>alive too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do you sit on it for a year</v>

229
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

230
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Do what you gotta do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

231
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

232
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all speculation.</v>

233
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>We only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know until she comes back.</v>

234
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing too is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.330
<v Speaker 1>she had her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:08.061
<v Speaker 1>her downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

238
00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>her really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really low,</v>

239
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>which I empathize with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there,</v>

240
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.421
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>these all these negative thoughts and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

244
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>then I looked up on the island and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>said this on my own show.</v>

245
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I looked up and I saw Travis Brown and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>

246
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to stick around to have his</v>

247
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought like what?</v>

248
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>What went through my mind is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get back and get my title back.</v>

249
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I gotta to get back and like win a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

250
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed like her mindset is</v>

251
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>different than what I would expect a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter's mindset to be.</v>

252
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

253
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying it's like it didn't seem</v>

254
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 1>like her motivation was to to fight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>win again.</v>

255
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was other things,</v>

256
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying she's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back and be great or come back and</v>

257
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not questioning that.</v>

258
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm questioning where her true</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation is coming from because I</v>

259
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>think while she was winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so awesome.</v>

260
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Like she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

261
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm want to keep doing this.</v>

262
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm going to keep a keep them</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing girls.</v>

263
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm demolishing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the star.</v>

264
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>All these great things are coming now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She already has that.</v>

265
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 1>She's already making movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She already has millions of millions of</v>

266
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Her true motivation?</v>

267
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Was it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>keeping that undefeated streak because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she talked about that so much.</v>

269
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will retire undefeated w and then she,</v>

270
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>she even said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

271
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm questioning what am I doing now?</v>

272
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>now I'm not going to ever retire</v>
<v Speaker 1>undefeated.</v>

274
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.930
<v Speaker 1>So what is my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm meant for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I meant she doesn't really know</v>

276
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>that was her identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like to be undefeated in this</v>

277
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:36.264
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

278
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>if that's not the goal anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

279
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like I sent something off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent something is not right in her</v>

280
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>mindset and I think she's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and I think she's going to fight</v>

281
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

282
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.280
<v Speaker 1>She'll fight hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't know if she still has</v>

283
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it after a brutal loss like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.270
<v Speaker 1>if she's still hungry enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are fighting words.</v>

285
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is She hungry?</v>

286
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question.</v>

287
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.320
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing right now is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're throwing up the bat signal,</v>

288
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I feel.</v>

290
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit because people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

291
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

292
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't apologize for anything that I</v>

293
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:16.550
<v Speaker 1>say unless I really say it's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

294
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.000
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't mean to say that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurtful to someone and I'm like,</v>

295
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:19.843
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>

296
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>But honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's my opinion is my opinion,</v>

297
00:11:21.591 --> 00:11:23.200
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

298
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna apologize for my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to apologize for anything</v>

299
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:27.261
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

300
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:29.320
<v Speaker 1>that had to say about the way I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Rhonda,</v>

301
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.520
<v Speaker 1>the way I feel about any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of these situations,</v>

302
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

303
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>So I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

304
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be as transparent as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

305
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're saying anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful either.</v>

306
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as a champion,</v>

307
00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

308
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.830
<v Speaker 1>you're analyzing someone's mindset and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're totally entitled to that.</v>

309
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a lot of respect for Rhonda</v>

310
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.550
<v Speaker 1>as an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

311
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think you'll ever be friends</v>

312
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>after it's all said and done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

313
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

314
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she thinks that I've done so</v>

315
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>many things and like I don't think she</v>
<v Speaker 1>would ever,</v>

316
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I think she blames me for things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even do.</v>

317
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

318
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.570
<v Speaker 1>how do you even get around that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

319
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I heard what you guys did your</v>

320
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said something like,</v>

321
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>then I called a promotion and like tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get crispy.</v>

322
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

323
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess with him before,</v>

324
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>like his fight or something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

325
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that I guess he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was contracted to another</v>

326
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>promotion and he wasn't supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was on the ultimate fighter.</v>

327
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that that Dana received a</v>
<v Speaker 1>call and then they thought that I,</v>

328
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>she thought that I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

329
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>first of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

330
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't even know he signed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another organization at all.</v>

331
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 1>like if he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't even,</v>

333
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have even crossed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm too,</v>

334
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.460
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too easy going to even think of</v>

335
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.670
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not malicious by any means.</v>

336
00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I've nothing against Krispy [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think she thought that I tried to</v>

337
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 1>like mess with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I called the promoter of whatever</v>

338
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little small contract.</v>

339
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Don't even know how I would have known</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

340
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 1>How would you even know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

341
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>But this is the same girl that ripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>page for,</v>

342
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 1>for congratulating holly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she has her way of thinking and</v>

343
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:09.910
<v Speaker 1>she's going to hate me until the day she</v>
<v Speaker 1>dies and I'm okay with that.</v>

344
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to be friends.</v>

345
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

346
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

347
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.800
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
