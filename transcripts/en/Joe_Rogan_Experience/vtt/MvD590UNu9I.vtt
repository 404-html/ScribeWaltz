00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>So I was big on surfing and in the first month or so that I was in Hawaii,</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I went to the apple store in Honolulu and uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I met one of my favorite surfers of all time.</v>

5
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:15.301
<v Speaker 1>I got called Kalani,</v>

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>and when I was playing Kelly Slater's pro surfing game,</v>

8
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I would always pick Kalani because he did the most radical moves,</v>

9
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:22.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>so I'm in the apple store,</v>

11
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>he's there with his boys.</v>

12
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

13
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

14
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.873
<v Speaker 1>that's Kalani Romp.</v>

15
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>And then he comes up to me,</v>

16
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:28.561
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

17
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:28.801
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

18
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you're that guy in load the rings.</v>

19
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.121
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

20
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:30.954
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

21
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>it's on now.</v>

22
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

23
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.171
<v Speaker 1>you're Kalani,</v>

24
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:34.391
<v Speaker 1>rob.</v>

25
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

26
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for like nine months,</v>

27
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>can you help me out surfing?</v>

28
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:37.831
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

29
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:37.981
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go the no show now.</v>

31
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So I came with him,</v>

32
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

33
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.393
<v Speaker 1>Hung out.</v>

34
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and we became really tight.</v>

36
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>So a huge story for a wife.</v>

37
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>For me it was getting to know Kalani.</v>

38
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean he taught me into waves.</v>

39
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I had no business being involved in.</v>

40
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a place called go island on the north shore,</v>

41
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>which is a heavy wave and you have to paddle out to an island,</v>

42
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>walk across the island because then you're going to miss the break and then</v>

43
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>paddle out past the break.</v>

44
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no concept of you're paddling out through the break because it's so big.</v>

45
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So as we Kalani and a few of his mates and we were all getting ready and he came</v>

46
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:10.081
<v Speaker 1>up to me,</v>

47
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

48
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

49
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>this is the most hectic wave I'm ever going to take you into.</v>

50
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Stay close to me.</v>

51
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>If you need help,</v>

52
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.763
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

53
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck around because it can kill you.</v>

54
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And don't go left.</v>

55
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Go right.</v>

56
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.991
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

57
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:22.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

58
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>don't go right.</v>

59
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Go left because going appeal left.</v>

60
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>But if you go right,</v>

61
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>you're in the braking zone and you're fucked.</v>

62
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

63
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

64
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.333

<v Speaker 1>So we.</v>

67
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So we paddle out and I'm having fun and I'm watching everyone in the lineup.</v>

68
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm about 10 feet away from the drop zone,</v>

69
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>so I'm able to like sit there on the wave and watch people like or the side.</v>

70
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

71
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

72
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

73
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I got this fast,</v>

74
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

75
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take it.</v>

76
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.901
<v Speaker 1>So I paddled out battle.</v>

77
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>That battle wave picked me up big like oh shit,</v>

78
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>super powerful drops me and I really try and go left.</v>

79
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I like cut the board and then try and go left.</v>

80
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's so powerful because breaking here on my left that it spits me to the</v>

81
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>rife.</v>

82
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm fully aware that it's about me to the right.</v>

83
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:02.551

86
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>take a big breath and paddle out.</v>

87
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.821
<v Speaker 1>So I wipe out.</v>

88
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I go on to come up and as is usually the case with surfing,</v>

89
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>anything above overhead when you come up that wave's coming for you against what</v>

90
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is take a huge breath,</v>

91
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>go under and it's the next time you come up you can make progress because you're</v>

92
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 1>out breath,</v>

93

97
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:28.920

98
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.360

99
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.230

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Come up again.</v>

109
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to time it so that I can get it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And at one point I see Kalani paddling over to me.</v>

115

<v Speaker 1>We're going to be okay.</v>

119
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So Kalani comes up to me and he's like mad,</v>

120
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 1>like I've never really heard him.</v>

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>get on your board and go that way.</v>

125
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

126
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

127
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been trying to do for like 10 minutes.</v>

128
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>But so now he's behind me.</v>

129
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.183
<v Speaker 1>He's paddling,</v>

130
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm paddling,</v>

131
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>he's pushing me,</v>

132
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>paddling,</v>

133
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.691
<v Speaker 1>pushing me,</v>

134
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>paddling like fucking superman.</v>

135
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And we eventually get out past the break.</v>

136
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

137
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

138
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sit here for 20 minutes and then when I'm done you're going to</v>

139
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>paddle in with me safe.</v>

140
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:10.661

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So when we come in,</v>

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.361
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

146
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I came in to get you,</v>

147
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it was not only were you in the drop zone but you were like completely lacking</v>

148
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>of any color on your face.</v>

149
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.611
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

150
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.271
<v Speaker 1>people in the line,</v>

151
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:22.661
<v Speaker 1>it was saying,</v>

152
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

153
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>go get your boy because he's in trouble.</v>

154
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

155
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I was handling it.</v>

156
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely out of breath and a little fucked up.</v>

157
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>But he's a wharton then.</v>

158
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:30.941
<v Speaker 1>So he was like,</v>

159
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

160
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>eight more waves on your headlight that you wouldn't have had the strength to</v>

161
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.370
<v Speaker 1>fight past the wave and get up here because you get these little gasps in there.</v>

162
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

163
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>it's so heavy and it has a really good trick.</v>

164
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:41.981
<v Speaker 1>Colone told me this one.</v>

165
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:42.341
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

166
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're under the water and you rolling around and you're fucked and you need</v>

167
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:46.684
<v Speaker 1>to take a breath,</v>

168
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>drink the tiniest amount of seawater.</v>

169
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Tiny sip.</v>

170
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Just go like that.</v>

171
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Tricks your body into thinking you took a breath and it will give you an extra</v>

172
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>five seconds.</v>

173
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>So because you've just taken an in will,</v>

174
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:59.201
<v Speaker 1>not an inhalation,</v>

175
00:03:59.201 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but you've,</v>

176
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you've put something in your body so your lungs are like,</v>

177
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.991
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

178
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>we can chill.</v>

179
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>The panic goes for a little bit.</v>

180
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:06.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the girls I grew up around,</v>

182
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

183
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

184
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 2>they had to maintain their virginity for marriage.</v>

185
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.730
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of them took in the.</v>

186
00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:12.720
<v Speaker 2>But yes.</v>

187
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.663
<v Speaker 2>Paula,</v>

188
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 2>lot of butts I guess.</v>

189
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Did you know,</v>

190
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.271
<v Speaker 2>is that really true?</v>

191
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:19.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what they were doing.</v>

192
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.321
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

193
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

194
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.891
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

195
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:21.780
<v Speaker 2>the one girl that I was pretty close with,</v>

196
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 2>she was 18 years old.</v>

197
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I was 13 and like we hung out a lot when you take the bus to the beach from the</v>

198
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 2>valley and smoked cigarettes and uh,</v>

199
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:31.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

200
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 2>she took it in the but</v>

201
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.990
<v Speaker 2>she was five years old and new.</v>

202
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.770
<v Speaker 2>That's it's one thing if you're 30 and she's 35,</v>

203
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 2>that's totally normal.</v>

204
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

205
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 2>But 15 and 18,</v>

206
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking 13.</v>

207
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.963
<v Speaker 2>I was 13.</v>

208
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen,</v>

209
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.961
<v Speaker 2>13 and 18.</v>

210
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:49.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

211
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:50.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant gap.</v>

212
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.120
<v Speaker 2>A Jeff five years is a giant five years is.</v>

213
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of that is she was so sheltered,</v>

214
00:04:56.311 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 2>she'd grown up in such a strict Persian family that maybe mentally she was 13.</v>

215
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.471
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

216
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I taught her to smoke cigarettes and stuff.</v>

217
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.473
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

218
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 2>You told her?</v>

219
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.260
<v Speaker 2>She was real sheltered.</v>

221
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Jesus shed like we take the bus to the beach and she would have to stop at a</v>

222
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 2>payphone every hour to call her dad and check in.</v>

223
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 2>That's how strict they were.</v>

224
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

225
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty.</v>

227
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.663
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

228
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.471
<v Speaker 2>Wonder what happened?</v>

229
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>What was her rationale?</v>

230
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

231
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.160
<v Speaker 2>probably my buddy's buddy.</v>

232
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.420
<v Speaker 2>How many times did you take in the ass for everything breaks down.</v>

233
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 2>You're driving off road with a car that's not designed for it.</v>

234
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got the wrong direction on that vehicle.</v>

235
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand?</v>

236
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.650
<v Speaker 2>It's an.</v>

237
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.981
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

238
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

239
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.601
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

241
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:47.270
<v Speaker 2>it's never been about this</v>

242
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 2>with reasonably good reason.</v>

243
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

244
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 2>it's chocolate.</v>

245
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of wrong.</v>

246
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean she,</v>

247
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.141
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

248
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>it be a lot of clean up pre and post.</v>

249
00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Speaker 2>But second of all this girl,</v>

251
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>what was her rationale to maintain purity?</v>

252
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very common thing.</v>

253
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

254
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>how did she explained it though,</v>

255
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 2>that I have to be married a virgin,</v>

256
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 2>that my father,</v>

257
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 2>they checked the bedsheets on your wedding night and eat you out if you're a</v>

258
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.663
<v Speaker 2>person</v>

259
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>and then he can tell.</v>

260
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.863
<v Speaker 2>That's right Tom.</v>

261
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Exactly how it went.</v>

262
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

263
00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.883
<v Speaker 2>Normal.</v>

265
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.630
<v Speaker 2>He finishes up and he's like,</v>

266
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

267
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.871
<v Speaker 2>you're still good.</v>

268
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 2>So it's a little bloody</v>

269
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>fucking Christ Jesus Christ.</v>

270
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

271
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So when she explained it to where you like at 13,</v>

272
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:41.301
<v Speaker 2>you're probably.</v>

273
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Wait what I mean,</v>

274
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.400
<v Speaker 2>but in the book,</v>

275
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

276
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like I knew about sex was.</v>

277
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was at,</v>

278
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing anything.</v>

279
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was getting my ass fingers.</v>

280
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:53.924
<v Speaker 2>I was 13.</v>

281
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.021
<v Speaker 2>I was very,</v>

282
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:57.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.011
<v Speaker 2>an experience.</v>

284
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I was just blown away.</v>

285
00:06:59.331 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

286
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.523
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

287
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>she was so funny.</v>

288
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>This is so a memory I have of her.</v>

289
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I was wearing a tank top and it was summertime and I remember she poked my</v>

290
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 2>armpit fat and she goes,</v>

291
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.061
<v Speaker 2>Ooh girl,</v>

292
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:13.930
<v Speaker 2>you got to have big tvs where you grow up arm,</v>

293
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.593
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

294
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.701
<v Speaker 2>fatty,</v>

295
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:17.400
<v Speaker 2>and I in La.</v>

296
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.111
<v Speaker 2>She was right.</v>

297
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:18.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

298
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I was armpit fat.</v>

299
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

300
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:20.721
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

301
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought that it was,</v>

302
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>it was bizarre,</v>

303
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 2>but she explained that it was a religious thing and this was to maintain her</v>

304
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:28.574
<v Speaker 2>purity.</v>

305
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 2>God wants her to take in the but God wants you to do anal</v>

306
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 3>and then you come out of it and you slowly come out of it and you were like</v>

307
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 3>noise canceling headphones.</v>

308
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm just in a doctor's office like in a weird,</v>

309
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.000
<v Speaker 3>not even weird like those like 19 seventies doctors' offices that you see in la,</v>

310
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.000
<v Speaker 3>like just sort of a shitty elevator and whatever.</v>

311
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 3>So when I came out of the first one I was like,</v>

312
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.640
<v Speaker 3>it was rough because I didn't know I was going to trip like that and b,</v>

313
00:07:57.641 --> 00:07:58.660
<v Speaker 3>I had been.</v>

314
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a ton of sleep the night before and so I was.</v>

315
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 3>And I'd flown that day.</v>

316
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I was just kind of groggy and,</v>

317
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 3>and I felt really shitty and it took me like I was like,</v>

318
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.410
<v Speaker 3>after I was done,</v>

319
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I probably laid in the bed there for like an hour.</v>

320
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.340
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

321
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I can't do shit right now.</v>

322
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't,</v>

323
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I could barely stand.</v>

324
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 3>So the first day was rough and uh,</v>

325
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.030
<v Speaker 3>and that I still felt shitty that night.</v>

326
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

327
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm going to do it again.</v>

328
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:27.761
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

329
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:28.594
<v Speaker 3>that was too rough.</v>

330
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.973
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

331
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.330
<v Speaker 3>then I woke up Tuesday morning and felt fucking great.</v>

332
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

333
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.943
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

334
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

335
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.710
<v Speaker 3>I got to do it again,</v>

336
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.491
<v Speaker 3>felt great.</v>

337
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt clear.</v>

338
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:42.251
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

339
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways my</v>

340
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 3>depression manifested itself was like,</v>

341
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.913
<v Speaker 3>I felt</v>

342
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 3>my head felt heavy and I felt like I had like,</v>

343
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 3>I had like a weight on my forehead,</v>

344
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

345
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I felt when I did ecstasy the day after,</v>

346
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 3>the day after.</v>

347
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.470
<v Speaker 3>I felt it felt amazing when I did that.</v>

348
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it is because it depletes.</v>

349
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:08.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

350
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

351
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.260
<v Speaker 3>All the Serotonin's gun.</v>

352
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

353
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically what people with depression a lot of times are like,</v>

354
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 3>just everyday isn't just like a headwind.</v>

355
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:16.494
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

356
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 3>it's just like fucking,</v>

357
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 3>could this be a little bit easier?</v>

358
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not asking for a miracle and just like I'm just sick of having to walk</v>

359
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 3>into the wind all the time,</v>

360
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.990
<v Speaker 3>a little bit uphill into the wind.</v>

361
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

362
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 3>fuck all right.</v>
