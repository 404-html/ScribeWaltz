1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches like way over the line.</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>because then you can't do critical government stuff.</v>

4
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It's still legal precedent that's set.</v>

5
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>That then makes the craziest shit possible where it's like,</v>

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.331
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

7
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>this is a words are violence.</v>

8
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>These words are violence.</v>

9
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm raped now.</v>

10
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>No one can say like,</v>

11
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>our new president is horrible.</v>

12
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>like now you can't even show descent.</v>

14
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all just a way to tighten the screws.</v>

15
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that people in the left or showing dissent more than like a</v>

16
00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>violent descent towards the president,</v>

17
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.150
<v Speaker 1>like really like,</v>

18
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

19
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>like in a way that I can't remember anybody doing towards Obama now to the point</v>

20
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>where it freaks me out.</v>

21
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:37.981
<v Speaker 1>Like they're like,</v>

22
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

23
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

25
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't obviously traveling in the right circles.</v>

26
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Look for people that really angry at Obama,</v>

27
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>but even the people that I saw online that are angry and um,</v>

28
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>they were calling them in competent or fool or spend it all of our money and all</v>

29
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>this different accusations,</v>

30
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>but not like what I'm seeing with trump.</v>

31
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm seeing just like flat out insults from famous people all the time.</v>

32
00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:00.511
<v Speaker 1>and the media,</v>

34
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't get white people totally trust immediate.</v>

35
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'll see them misrepresent something in such an egregious way and my</v>

36
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>dad is a rhetoric professor so it's like he teaches a class in propaganda.</v>

37
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>This is like my whole childhood is learned about the shit.</v>

38
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching CNN.</v>

39
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

40
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.724
<v Speaker 1>you motherfuckers,</v>

41
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly like you can misrepresent things.</v>

42
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So agregious Lee,</v>

43
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.464
<v Speaker 1>that I'm like,</v>

44
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>of course no one's going to trust you and that's a problem.</v>

45
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:25.591
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

46
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that you.</v>

47
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't wish that they were correct,</v>

48
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It's that in them lying.</v>

50
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're on their side more than you're on the Fox News,</v>

51
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>CNN lies even a little.</v>

52
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Then it's fuel for the other side and it vastly diminishes the impact that you</v>

53
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>can have because you're not.</v>

54
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>You're not trustworthy anymore.</v>

55
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So literally that's all you have in news now is trustworthiness because everyone</v>

56
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>can manipulate and photoshop.</v>

57
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:52.771
<v Speaker 1>Now that,</v>

58
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

59
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>that Audio Photoshop,</v>

60
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

61
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to just trust people.</v>

62
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust anybody though.</v>

63
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>It's real issue and an issue with an issue with the left being so hyperbolic.</v>

64
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like when trump was first elected,</v>

65
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:05.431
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

66
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:05.611
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

67
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>sucks,</v>

68
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.253
<v Speaker 1>trump's crazy.</v>

69
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw their reaction and almost like triaged it when I was like,</v>

70
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.061
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

71
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:12.751
<v Speaker 1>what's crazier?</v>

72
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>The guy that may like texted dictator is Dick,</v>

73
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>or like people like saying that democracy is bad and I'm like,</v>

74
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird battle.</v>

75
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.933
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>but that stayed with me and then when I started at quest and we were helping all</v>

77
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>these kids are working with all these kids and I saw how extraordinary they</v>

78
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>

79
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>which by the way drug dealers,</v>

80
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>some of them are amazing entrepreneurs and so it became this notion in my.</v>

81
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.641
<v Speaker 1>It's unreal.</v>

82
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Did I'll tell you some stories sometimes.</v>

83
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

84
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.081
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

85
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:43.914
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>

86
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.611
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

87
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:45.091
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

88
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you're a better entrepreneur than I am.</v>

89
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Like they're telling me how they watched like the cop cars and when they change</v>

90
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>shifts and how they know that they're being identified by their cars.</v>

91
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And so they changed cars all the time as crazy.</v>

92
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like,</v>

93
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

94
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>it gave me this concept that I called mining for astronauts</v>

95
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like in here,</v>

96
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.291
<v Speaker 2>in here,</v>

97
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.291
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in here being the ghetto are some of the most amazing minds I've ever</v>

98
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 2>come across.</v>

99
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And these guys could be anything.</v>

100
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It can be fucking astronauts,</v>

101
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:10.871
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

102
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever they wanted,</v>

103
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but they don't believe they can.</v>

104
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>And when I would interview them it was nuts.</v>

105
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you're interviewing.</v>

106
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 2>And I came up with just like a fast weighted where I didn't have to think I</v>

107
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 2>could just ask the same questions and one of the questions was a magic genie</v>

108
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 2>shows up is going to grant you one wish and one in which only you can't wish for</v>

109
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.301
<v Speaker 2>more wishes.</v>

110
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:28.991
<v Speaker 2>You can't cure cancer.</v>

111
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Bringing anybody back from the desk.</v>

112
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd be something for yourself.</v>

113
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>What do you wish for universally to a person?</v>

114
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>They all said a job.</v>

115
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.171
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

116
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:36.004
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

117
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>If you think that's what I want to hear.</v>

118
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to get a job so you can tell me you want a job.</v>

119
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Then when we get past that bullshit,</v>

120
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>and I tell you,</v>

121
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's not true,</v>

122
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 2>like what do you really want?</v>

123
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the job to get you money?</v>

124
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

125
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you want money or is it something else?</v>

126
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.611
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

127
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 2>it's money.</v>

128
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.691
<v Speaker 2>Awesome man.</v>

129
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a magic genie can ask for whatever you want.</v>

130
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.260
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

131
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what answer?</v>

132
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Every single one of them gave me.</v>

133
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Well $1,000,000.</v>

134
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 2>You can't buy a fucking house for a million dollars.</v>

135
00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 2>K,</v>

136
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 2>it was so crazy.</v>

137
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a magic genie.</v>

138
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

139
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Like you can ask for a trillion dollars,</v>

140
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 2>but their frame of reference was so small.</v>

141
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.171
<v Speaker 2>One guy,</v>

142
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>this was like the one exception said he wanted an airport.</v>

143
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I found that so weird.</v>

144
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.481
<v Speaker 2>So I had to push them.</v>

145
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:13.931
<v Speaker 2>That one I was like,</v>

146
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>why an airport?</v>

147
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.101
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

148
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>because business guys come through the airport and I was like,</v>

149
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.723
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

150
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

151
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>What good does that do you?</v>

152
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:21.581
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

153
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 2>because then they can teach me about business.</v>

154
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Nothing about that for a second.</v>

155
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.160
<v Speaker 1>How Fun</v>

156
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>can many steps removed are you from what you actually want?</v>

157
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 2>But that's like they don't have you say,</v>

158
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm a systematic thinker,</v>

159
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

160
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.610
<v Speaker 2>So I had to learn that that's not where I started.</v>

161
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 2>So I spent thankfully one of the things I'm most grateful for in my life.</v>

162
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn everything the hard way,</v>

163
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 2>but because I learned things the hard way,</v>

164
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Speaker 2>then I can show other people what I did,</v>

165
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.270
<v Speaker 2>where I fell down and how hopefully they can avoid some of the mistakes.</v>

166
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what you need is,</v>

167
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 2>is a</v>

168
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.340
<v Speaker 1>bathroom would adore that faces outside.</v>

169
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>The worst is when you go over a girl's house and you go to use her bathroom and</v>

170
00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you smell matches.</v>

171
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

172
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.771
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

173
00:04:58.771 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

174
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker up</v>

175
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

176
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking about burning it off fumes.</v>

177
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

178
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.041
<v Speaker 1>just stinky.</v>

179
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>But I hate about her.</v>

180
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Matthew ever get to a girl's place and then you feel the gurgles and you're</v>

181
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.843
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

182
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I could have had that before.</v>

183
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I was dating a girl once.</v>

184
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 1>She had ferocious diarrhea.</v>

185
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Ferocious.</v>

186
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So she was seeing regularly or just one time.</v>

187
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And she.</v>

188
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 1>So she went to the bathroom and she just turned on the shower and she turns on</v>

189
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>both things on the sink.</v>

190
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

191
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I just tried to drown it out.</v>

193
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

194
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:36.470
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

195
00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I was very young at the time.</v>

196
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:38.544
<v Speaker 1>It didn't understand what.</v>

197
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I was super confused.</v>

198
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.610
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on in there?</v>

199
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.683
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

200
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I had once in,</v>

201
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.560
<v Speaker 1>in college where I was at this girl's place and she was just like,</v>

202
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.041
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

203
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it's game on,</v>

204
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.593
<v Speaker 1>like go for it.</v>

205
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

206
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like I have to take and I could feel that it was a diarrhea,</v>

207
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>explosive diarrhea shit.</v>

208
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And I also realized there was no way to do it that,</v>

209
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>that it would just a black toilet and there's no way I could cover.</v>

210
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:01.694
<v Speaker 1>So you know what I did?</v>

211
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I went back to my place.</v>

212
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

213
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

214
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you some other time or whatever.</v>

215
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>And the next day her friends were like,</v>

216
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you're like the fucking.</v>

217
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Like they gave me credit that they,</v>

218
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>they thought that I was a good kid.</v>

219
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:13.491
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

220
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you're awesome.</v>

221
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.541
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

222
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:14.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

223
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I had to take my girls do that because they're not getting fucked and they don't</v>

224
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>want their friend to get fucked.</v>

225
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

226
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>So they used reverse psychology on you.</v>

227
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>You're an amazing guy.</v>

232
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Even when you get married.</v>

233
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Tell her we'd get married</v>

234
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.600
<v Speaker 1>to have sex after you're married.</v>

235
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not about that.</v>

236
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>It's about real love.</v>

237
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Twilight love.</v>

238
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>If I had had bowels that were intact,</v>

239
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a different story that night.</v>

240
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Owls,</v>

241
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.603
<v Speaker 1>bowels,</v>

242
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Speaker 1>bowels.</v>

243
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a time when you know that it's.</v>

246
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>And the sensitivity of your inner asshole region.</v>

247
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.801
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

248
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>It knows.</v>

249
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you go to seep out a Fart,</v>

250
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.771

252
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>And then also the alarms start going off.</v>

253
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.620

<v Speaker 1>like why is it hot?</v>

262
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And then why does,</v>

263

<v Speaker 1>why do you know that hot is going to smell bad spicy food bro?</v>

264
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.771

265
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:13.604
<v Speaker 1>But is that what it is?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

271
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you guys at one time my freshman year,</v>

272
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take a ship for a week and a half.</v>

273
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted this fake,</v>

274
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.040

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.873

276
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.343
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me.</v>

277
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.390
<v Speaker 3>How long is that?</v>

278
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I was in when I was five.</v>

279
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I played freshman ball and we were playing paterson eastside.</v>

280
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

281
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 1>just a jungle over school.</v>

282
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta be careful when you're going there.</v>

283
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.020
<v Speaker 1>And we went there to play the Christmas tournament.</v>

284
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

285
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.220
<v Speaker 1>what kind of ball are we talking right now?</v>

286
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Basketball and I hadn't taken a shift for like 10 days or something.</v>

287
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.091
<v Speaker 1>I took acid.</v>

288
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Something fucked my stomach up.</v>

289
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't tell nobody.</v>

290
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.510
<v Speaker 1>In those days I was really scared of doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody.</v>

291
00:07:59.500 --> 00:07:59.951
<v Speaker 1>Way Home.</v>

292
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>We got on the bus</v>

293
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and while we will wait that my stomach started hurting.</v>

294
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.301
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

295
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

296
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm going to shit myself a fort,</v>

297
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but let me just take a chance.</v>

298
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Good move,</v>

299
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.280
<v Speaker 1>and I blew this fart Joe Rogan.</v>

300
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That was so bad,</v>

301
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

302
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.420
<v Speaker 1>We want a bus,</v>

303
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:20.380
<v Speaker 1>and people started running.</v>

304
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:21.490
<v Speaker 1>You know the school buses.</v>

305
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Speaker 1>People started running to the windows right to swing down the bus windows,</v>

306
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>but he is what you to by the father.</v>

307
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.143
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

308
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.850
<v Speaker 1>as the teachers would go,</v>

309
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.511
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

310
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>he's changing flavors.</v>

311
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

312
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.473
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

313
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst thing was the cheerleaders are crying.</v>

314
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 3>That's how bad it was sitting in front of the bus going,</v>

315
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 3>changing teachers yelled,</v>

316
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.521
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

317
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:50.354
<v Speaker 3>he's changing.</v>

318
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Speaker 3>That's how bad it was.</v>
