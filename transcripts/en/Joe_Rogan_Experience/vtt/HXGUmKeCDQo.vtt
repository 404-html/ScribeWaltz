<v Speaker 1>Did the guy match or something?</v>

91
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

109
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.341

<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is a p o l o n I s t a polo.</v>

117
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.860

<v Speaker 1>a urine soaked knife.</v>

118
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what the story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so crazy.</v>

119
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.720

<v Speaker 1>they transmit fecal matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transplant it to someone's,</v>

124
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>a intestinal tract and apparently it's</v>

125
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be like good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to get that bacteria,</v>

126
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>like somebody else's bacteria in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body through a fecal transplant.</v>

<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

164
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:07.501
<v Speaker 2>It was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine that someone could </v>

165
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:07.501
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ran those dudes over.</v>

171
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:24.421
<v Speaker 2>because of the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a.</v>

172
00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there was a gun in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

173
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You only put guns back there.</v>

178
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.390
<v Speaker 2>When a guy does that and he sticks </v>
<v Speaker 2>something behind their back.</v>

179
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.760

<v Speaker 2>Hell raiser kind of brought it back to </v>

350
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.531
<v Speaker 2>white people because black people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like hell raiser and should've been </v>

351
00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:20.531
<v Speaker 2>spawn or stockton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:24.910
<v Speaker 2>that's very good point because hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>raiser was a white guy in the movie and </v>

353
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.640
<v Speaker 2>black people hate scary movies generally</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>

354
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:33.641
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scary movies generally all </v>

355
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.540
<v Speaker 2>stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypical generalizations of how to </v>

356
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:39.540
<v Speaker 2>raise up people.</v>

357
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.210
<v Speaker 2>You got to be able to generalize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generalize,</v>

358
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you can generalize and you </v>

359
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 2>can't make any fucking points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so true.</v>

360
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't make any points.</v>

361
00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know one guy that doesn't do that.</v>

362
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 2>My yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy too,</v>

363
00:17:56.611 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>but generally Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things are.</v>

364
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Before you say what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

365
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this might sound a little bit </v>

366
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.240
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not racist.</v>

367
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>But you ever see that twitter feed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not racist.</v>

368
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It's all people saying racist shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not racist.</v>

369
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 2>But then they say some racist shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the most racist.</v>

370
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 2>How can you read some racist shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be accused of being racist?</v>

371
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 2>We'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so,</v>

372
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 2>definitely not because if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone was telling a story about </v>

373
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.510
<v Speaker 2>some racist white guy who said the n </v>
<v Speaker 2>word to a black guy,</v>

374
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 2>the black guy hit him or something.</v>

375
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you tell that story and use and use </v>

376
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:38.460
<v Speaker 2>that word or do you have to say it again</v>
<v Speaker 2>when describing the story?</v>

377
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

378
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Because Howard stern just says the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when he talks about someone </v>

379
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get this one right here.</v>

380
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop right there.</v>

381
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will not stand to see my country </v>

382
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.600
<v Speaker 2>attacked by black whiners that feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for themselves.</v>

383
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quit breaking the law ass.</v>

384
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

385
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.780
<v Speaker 2>These are real well put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well put what?</v>

386
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.600
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between high levels</v>

387
00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 2>of African American and a n word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

388
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't even say the word until I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican,</v>

389
00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:24.431
<v Speaker 2>so I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could actually get away with it if I </v>

390
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:24.431
<v Speaker 2>say an Igg Iga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but am I.</v>

391
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't do the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't even say it.</v>

392
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't not.</v>

393
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Not even calling something it not </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling a person a nigger,</v>

394
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 2>but saying the word like me saying it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and you're like,</v>

395
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:35.160
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say it.</v>

396
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.240
<v Speaker 2>How come you didn't say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just did it.</v>

397
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

398
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's awesome.</v>

399
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

400
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.580
<v Speaker 2>They have a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no big deal.</v>

401
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 2>But like what if you got one until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can say wetback and stuff too.</v>

402
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>What if you're like reading to like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of small children.</v>

403
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the guy had called me a wetback,</v>

404
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 2>that would be very offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem that.</v>

405
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not quite as strong as the n word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

406
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.320
<v Speaker 2>it's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like bronze metal.</v>

407
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An end is like the gold metal year after</v>

408
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.480
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even being racist,</v>

409
00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:14.481
<v Speaker 2>but walking behind black people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallways is the last place I ever want </v>

410
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:14.481
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

411
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what you're.</v>

412
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 2>What the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even being racist.</v>

413
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally,</v>

414
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:29.511
<v Speaker 2>I literally am not racist at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I don't get why a lot of black </v>

415
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:33.120
<v Speaker 2>people feel the need to be ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally all the time.</v>

416
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

417
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.100
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about Trinidad James.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a double double literally and no</v>

418
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:42.990
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling that sense.</v>

419
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

420
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 2>But what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caucasians,</v>

421
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Caucasians are evil as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smh,</v>

422
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.860
<v Speaker 3>I've got a real issue with Smh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

423
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shaking my head.</v>

424
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 3>I am just stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>

425
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.720

<v Speaker 3>Especially white people.</v>

426
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this one.</v>

427
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Justin,</v>

428
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:11.791
<v Speaker 3>please stop hanging with black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are making you too ghetto people </v>

429
00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:16.441
<v Speaker 3>think you're trying to be black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seth Rogan said about Justin Bieber,</v>

430
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Howard Stern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

431
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:19.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

432
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.640
<v Speaker 3>he thought he was going to meet Justin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought,</v>

433
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to actually be a cool guy.</v>

434
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He expected me to be a cool guy,</v>

435
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 3>but seth throw him under the bus and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said he was a uh,</v>

436
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

437
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Just the opposite of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

438
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.040
<v Speaker 3>not a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Douche bag.</v>

439
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 3>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that.</v>

440
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.630
<v Speaker 3>He got so famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so young and he's really fucking good </v>

441
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:47.720
<v Speaker 3>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

442
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a guest model now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on sunset and he's got his leg with</v>

443
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:55.750
<v Speaker 3>the CIC for gas or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy's a really good looking guy.</v>

444
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:57.620
<v Speaker 3>If he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't have a.</v>

445
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would still get mad chick.</v>

446
00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:05.341
<v Speaker 3>So how is a guy like that not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a Douche bag and possibly it is </v>

447
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 3>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's up against them.</v>

448
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's kissing his ass all fucking </v>

449
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really good looking.</v>

450
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 3>We can sing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can.</v>

451
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 3>He's very talented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his songs.</v>

452
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I would never buy a cds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the dude can sing really good.</v>

453
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:19.870
<v Speaker 3>He could play guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shreds on drums.</v>

454
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 3>He's been a musician his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's actually very talented,</v>

455
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.310
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way that guy's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it through the teens.</v>

456
00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:27.550
<v Speaker 3>And I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>

457
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.200
<v Speaker 3>21 night just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how you going to get there through </v>

458
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.030
<v Speaker 3>all that and not be a Douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

459
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Is a recent scientific study done that </v>
<v Speaker 3>proves that assholes get more chicks.</v>

460
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.990
<v Speaker 3>John Danner just cued us into this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they did a study.</v>

461
00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:47.991
<v Speaker 3>I'm not 100 percent sure where or when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had a women analyze photos of </v>

462
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 3>different pictures of men doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>different facial expressions and the men</v>

463
00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:56.910
<v Speaker 3>with scowls and like their chest puffed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

464
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Essentially what you would look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody and be like,</v>

465
00:22:58.981 --> 00:23:00.090
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude's an asshole.</v>

466
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Like right off your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

467
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Those got higher ratings in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>good looks than the guys that were </v>

468
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.120
<v Speaker 3>smiling and looked happy signs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typically chicks,</v>

469
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:16.130
<v Speaker 3>but those studies are all who's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who were the people that were in those </v>

470
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.320
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would make a huge difference.</v>

471
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.380
<v Speaker 3>If it was young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>older people,</v>

472
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 3>I could make a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done a full analysis of this </v>

473
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 3>study yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would want to know.</v>

474
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.881
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whether it's college kids that are </v>

475
00:23:28.881 --> 00:23:29.370
<v Speaker 3>young and don't know any better or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's women in their thirties.</v>

476
00:23:29.371 --> 00:23:32.340
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know like where the drop</v>
<v Speaker 3>off point is with chicks,</v>

477
00:23:32.341 --> 00:23:34.770
<v Speaker 3>get tired of dudes with their chest </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticking out,</v>

478
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 3>you know that for whatever reason might </v>
<v Speaker 3>be appealing for an 18 year old.</v>

479
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.920
<v Speaker 3>I think girls like that in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they end up fucking hating.</v>

480
00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:45.910
<v Speaker 3>It kills zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what</v>

481
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were attracted to the barbarian and</v>

482
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:52.710
<v Speaker 5>the fucking wild savage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then now they got them that damn,</v>

483
00:23:52.711 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 5>I wish he wasn't such a fucking savage </v>
<v Speaker 5>because other bitches like that too.</v>

484
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.470
<v Speaker 5>So then they ended up hating that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

485
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't be.</v>

486
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:03.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's okay because that acid is just </v>

487
00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:03.671
<v Speaker 5>going to move onto another chick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's totally okay with that.</v>

488
00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:04.140
<v Speaker 5>So while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>until it wears off,</v>

489
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.610
<v Speaker 5>that asshole is not looking to settle </v>
<v Speaker 5>down with like one chick,</v>

490
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Depends which asshole.</v>

491
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Well you know what I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're still stuck with the </v>

492
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.250
<v Speaker 5>echoes of some ancient Dna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we still have,</v>

493
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:24.550
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we still have all the instincts that </v>

494
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.911
<v Speaker 5>people had back when you had to worry </v>
<v Speaker 5>about like marauding hordes coming over </v>

495
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 5>the top of the hill with swords and </v>
<v Speaker 5>knives,</v>

496
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.240
<v Speaker 5>like you had to be kind of an asshole </v>
<v Speaker 5>back then,</v>

497
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you had a fuck more than one chick </v>

498
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.671
<v Speaker 5>because your kids are all going to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed by arrows and fucking flying </v>

499
00:24:39.671 --> 00:24:39.671
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

500
00:24:39.671 --> 00:24:41.570
<v Speaker 5>So that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very good point.</v>

501
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 5>If you're living back then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

502
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 5>you had tons of DNA spreading mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to have fertility rituals.</v>

503
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 5>Whether you would hope that people got </v>
<v Speaker 5>pregnant.</v>

504
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:52.220
<v Speaker 5>The exact opposite of what we do today </v>
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

505
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:55.350
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please get her fucking period please.</v>

506
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 5>And back then they were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had rituals and by the time we were</v>

507
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:01.970
<v Speaker 5>in our twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way before we had kids,</v>

508
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 5>those people back in the day like we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>all our DNA came from.</v>

509
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.380
<v Speaker 5>They were on their way out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They not only had kids,</v>

510
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:14.381
<v Speaker 5>they were getting old and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be dead by the time they're in </v>

511
00:25:14.381 --> 00:25:17.021
<v Speaker 5>their thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd probably be killed or disease or </v>

512
00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 5>something so that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reason why we're here is because the</v>

513
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:24.221
<v Speaker 5>same reason why women would like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's aggressive or an asshole because </v>

514
00:25:24.221 --> 00:25:25.010
<v Speaker 5>she thinks that guy could protect her.</v>

515
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.840
<v Speaker 5>It's this bizarre fucking trick that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature is played on this,</v>

516
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Speaker 5>this thousands of years of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 5>technologically and historically and how</v>

517
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 5>much information we have in the way we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could communicate with each other.</v>

518
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.410
<v Speaker 5>Still doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still doesn't stills in totally stopped </v>

519
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 5>at monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck gene.</v>

520
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.720
<v Speaker 5>That's still deep down in the back </v>
<v Speaker 5>because chicks want some guy who could </v>

521
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.830
<v Speaker 5>defend the castle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that true,</v>

522
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:49.740
<v Speaker 5>Garrett?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

523
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.180
<v Speaker 5>So study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Study proved that man,</v>

524
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.020
<v Speaker 5>your personal study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's not my case study.</v>

525
00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.530
<v Speaker 5>Now I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish.</v>

526
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.160
<v Speaker 5>I wish I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm working on becoming more and more of</v>

527
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:06.161
<v Speaker 5>an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get better at it and not </v>

528
00:26:06.161 --> 00:26:08.190
<v Speaker 5>people that have fucking acl </v>
<v Speaker 5>reconstruction.</v>

529
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.110
<v Speaker 5>Then I'll do my best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

530
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.610
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm chasing that dream because I.</v>

531
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 5>it's clear that they are more successful</v>
<v Speaker 5>with women.</v>

532
00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:18.190
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Donna has a wizard that Kai,</v>

533
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.650
<v Speaker 5>he is such an interesting dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Such an interesting guy to talk to.</v>

534
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.700
<v Speaker 5>Such a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually don't train there for the </v>

535
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.931
<v Speaker 5>technique at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just for the stories that he tells </v>

536
00:26:28.931 --> 00:26:31.001
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you were saying before the </v>

537
00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:33.521
<v Speaker 5>podcast that data her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you went to Danaher's to get a private </v>

538
00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:34.460
<v Speaker 5>or something like that at first or train</v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

539
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 5>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

540
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 5>introduced you to his leg lock system?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

541
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

542
00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:43.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean just when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I started training with John,</v>

543
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

544
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first it was just an inconsistent basis,</v>

545
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:48.800
<v Speaker 6>like once a once a week or so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

546
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 6>a lot of MMA fighters come to like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>Monday afternoon class.</v>

547
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.810
<v Speaker 6>So I was going in there and that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was in college.</v>

548
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 6>I didn't have time to go over all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

549
00:26:56.311 --> 00:27:01.311
<v Speaker 6>but once I started going there </v>
<v Speaker 6>consistently I got a chance to see like </v>

550
00:27:01.311 --> 00:27:04.461
<v Speaker 6>kind of the strategies that he teaches </v>
<v Speaker 6>and leg locks aren't like his main </v>

551
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:09.681
<v Speaker 6>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think he's made huge innovations </v>

552
00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:09.681
<v Speaker 6>in the leg lock game to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

553
00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:10.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he teaches it,</v>

554
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 6>it seems like that's like his main </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

555
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

556
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

557
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 6>it's definitely went over like our whole</v>
<v Speaker 6>leg lock game.</v>

558
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 6>Me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

559
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 6>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eddie Cummings.</v>

560
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

561
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.160
<v Speaker 6>both of our games just stemmed from that</v>
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>

562
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's such a smart dude.</v>

563
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

564
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 6>so on the ball about so many things </v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

565
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of different aspects of life.</v>

566
00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:34.971
<v Speaker 6>He's a very interesting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody recently asked me what was the </v>

567
00:27:34.971 --> 00:27:37.900
<v Speaker 6>best advice I'd ever been given and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I continually preach it.</v>

568
00:27:37.901 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

569
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

570
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.360
<v Speaker 6>John always tells us never to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>married,</v>

571
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 6>but he lists for four reasons why you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could possibly get married.</v>

572
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these are four circumstances,</v>

573
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.050
<v Speaker 6>all of which have to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

574
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>marriage just isn't an option.</v>

575
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first all at the same time,</v>

576
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:55.930
<v Speaker 6>it was for all four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise it's.</v>

577
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the offers on the table,</v>

578
00:27:57.481 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 6>it's not like you definitely have to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>married.</v>

579
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.050
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>alright,</v>

580
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 6>we understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the first is that the woman has to be</v>

581
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:05.820
<v Speaker 6>between the ages of 18 and 25.</v>

582
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.360
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Second is that you have to be over the </v>

583
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.181
<v Speaker 6>age of 55.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The third is that you have to have no </v>

584
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:15.660
<v Speaker 6>money and the fourth is that she has to </v>
<v Speaker 6>have tons of money.</v>

585
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:21.020
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise it's just not even a question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't get that even in the wheel house.</v>

586
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's funny.</v>

587
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.360
<v Speaker 6>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think he recently added some </v>

588
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.570
<v Speaker 6>innovations to that theory with like the</v>
<v Speaker 6>woman has to be an info maniac or </v>

589
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.901
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He keeps making it harder and harder to </v>

590
00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:38.541
<v Speaker 6>get married as we as we go along.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would love to see her debate like an </v>

591
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 6>angry woman.</v>

592
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.200
<v Speaker 6>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure he's done that many,</v>

593
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 6>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but on those points.</v>

594
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 6>So he's not married.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see that happening anytime soon.</v>

595
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.230
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does he have a girlfriend?</v>

596
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 6>We don't know anything about his </v>
<v Speaker 6>personal life.</v>

597
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 6>He's a superstar you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

598
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>

599
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.710
<v Speaker 6>even if I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

600
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.550
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'd never.</v>

601
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.290
<v Speaker 6>We're not the player.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>

602
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 6>Would you consider him a player?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't answer any questions like that.</v>

603
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

604
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.210
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my car guy.</v>

605
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.490
<v Speaker 6>You guys think like we're like best </v>
<v Speaker 6>friends with them because he trained </v>

606
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.871
<v Speaker 6>with him all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know nothing about this guy as a </v>

607
00:29:19.871 --> 00:29:19.871
<v Speaker 6>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

608
00:29:19.871 --> 00:29:23.801
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like the little bits of pieces of </v>

609
00:29:23.801 --> 00:29:23.801
<v Speaker 6>the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We never hang out with them.</v>

610
00:29:23.801 --> 00:29:24.320
<v Speaker 6>None of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's a,</v>

611
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 6>he's an enigma for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what he does once he steps off the </v>

612
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 6>mat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he disappears into the ether,</v>

613
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 6>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have no clue.</v>

614
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 6>Let's give a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a philosophy student right when </v>

615
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 6>he started training in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

616
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>GotTa.</v>

617
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 6>Get him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was super smart guy.</v>

618
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be an insane podcast.</v>

619
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'd be great.</v>

620
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 6>I would definitely</v>

621
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 5>love to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

622
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:48.451
<v Speaker 5>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're competing tomorrow at the Eddie </v>

623
00:29:48.451 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 5>Bravo invitational here in La and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the orpheum,</v>

624
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:50.170
<v Speaker 5>the orpheum theater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>downtown La,</v>

625
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 5>the orpheum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazing,</v>

626
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:56.311
<v Speaker 5>amazing place to have startup four doors</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the paper view starts at four.</v>

627
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be on bluedot </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos.com/Ebi,</v>

628
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 5>1499,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you,</v>

629
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:05.250
<v Speaker 5>even if you don't train,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're thinking about training,</v>

630
00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:05.940
<v Speaker 5>you've sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ma'am,</v>

631
00:30:05.941 --> 00:30:06.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm neither.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should do something.</v>

632
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:09.520
<v Speaker 5>You would watch how fun it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch how exciting it is.</v>

633
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 5>I think that the only reason why Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 5>and submission grappling,</v>

634
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:18.870
<v Speaker 5>the way you're doing it on your show was</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only reason why that's not on </v>

635
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.870
<v Speaker 5>television.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just people aren't,</v>

636
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.830
<v Speaker 5>they're not accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're accustomed to having golf on</v>

637
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:25.831
<v Speaker 5>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you sit there and watch golf or </v>

638
00:30:25.831 --> 00:30:27.871
<v Speaker 5>you're accustomed to having cricket and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some parts of the world like try </v>

639
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:27.871
<v Speaker 5>watching cricket.</v>

640
00:30:27.871 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 5>You ever been in England?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the channel and crickets on your.</v>

641
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:34.351
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The couple of times just to see if I </v>

642
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 5>could figure it out by watching it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like Nope,</v>

643
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why they keep running.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John told us that way.</v>

644
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>History about cricket.</v>

645
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.330
<v Speaker 5>They used to be a a guy that was known,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so at first they were only throwing like</v>

646
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.240
<v Speaker 5>70 mile an hour pitches and they started</v>
<v Speaker 5>to increase it up to like,</v>

647
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the nineties and the 100 mile an hour</v>

648
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 5>pitch range and a cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to purposefully throw the</v>

649
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:57.271
<v Speaker 5>ball at the person that's bagging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these guys would just wail people </v>

650
00:30:57.271 --> 00:31:01.350
<v Speaker 5>like in the face and they were just </v>
<v Speaker 5>known for that became famous for just </v>

651
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.231
<v Speaker 5>smashing people in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that benefit you if you're </v>

652
00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:04.231
<v Speaker 5>hitting the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

653
00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:04.231
<v Speaker 5>How does that.</v>

654
00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 5>How is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess?</v>

655
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.750
<v Speaker 5>I guess if you hit the guy and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

656
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 5>fuck them up enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be hard for him to hit the</v>

657
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 5>ball and hitting the knock them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how that works,</v>

658
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:19.621
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy hitting the ball have all the </v>

659
00:31:19.621 --> 00:31:19.621
<v Speaker 5>gear on who has the gear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

660
00:31:19.621 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 5>They see this is back when they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even really have that much gear to where</v>

661
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 5>they weren't even allowed to wear </v>
<v Speaker 5>helmets or anything like that.</v>

662
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

663
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would you not try to hit the guy </v>

664
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 5>every fucking time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that.</v>

665
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.840
<v Speaker 5>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to do.</v>

666
00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:36.841
<v Speaker 5>I think that's why you have a giant wide</v>
<v Speaker 5>paddle for a defensive tool that it </v>

667
00:31:36.841 --> 00:31:40.490
<v Speaker 5>affects a tool that's in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstance aim for the head every time</v>

668
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:45.570
<v Speaker 5>you think it was like that paddle work </v>
<v Speaker 5>better back when people were only </v>

669
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 5>throwing like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 5>70 miles an hour.</v>

670
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:51.450
<v Speaker 5>But now they're like majorly pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen the guy throw a fast ball </v>

671
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Speaker 5>like a major league fastball?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda terrifying me.</v>

672
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it live.</v>

673
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.640
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This speed at God can throw a ball.</v>

674
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.270
<v Speaker 5>It's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Eagle.</v>

675
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that swing.</v>

676
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:01.290
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

677
00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:03.610
<v Speaker 5>you're guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like in that area.</v>

678
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're hoping that he's aiming for,</v>

679
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.970
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Specifically your area.</v>

680
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 5>So who was the guy that died and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they started instituting those helmets.</v>

681
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a famous baseball player.</v>

682
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 5>He got hit and the owe me might not have</v>
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>

683
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:19.460
<v Speaker 5>He might've gotten like really fucked </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

684
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 5>It was never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I believe he played for the Red Sox,</v>

685
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.900
<v Speaker 5>but it was when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of got hit with a ball and it </v>

686
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 5>really fucked up and his career was </v>
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>

687
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.760
<v Speaker 5>It was never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember thinking,</v>

688
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.280
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one ball can do that.</v>

689
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 5>You can get hit with one ball and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>done with the fuck.</v>

690
00:32:37.091 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 5>Was that your last name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hayward.</v>

691
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

692
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:41.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

693
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a famous case.</v>

694
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob died late nights.</v>

695
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died later.</v>

696
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

697
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 1>this is probably some sports fans right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

698
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Screen when you got the whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>story wrong.</v>

00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the whole June.</v>

700
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Even the white grease ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point being,</v>

701
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 1>if Jujitsu is on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they got to see some wild matches,</v>

702
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.040
<v Speaker 1>especially one of the things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate about watching your match,</v>

703
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I got exposed to you by Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one I saw was you and chrome.</v>

704
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about.</v>

705
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.740
<v Speaker 3>We talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was an exciting match.</v>

706
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was two dudes to do like,</v>

707
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:29.100
<v Speaker 1>just razor sharp assassins trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chop each other down.</v>

708
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a match.</v>

709
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Just what a match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was incredible.</v>

710
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

711
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.180
<v Speaker 3>the first time I met you was at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar,</v>

712
00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:41.181
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in Florida for you at that seminar </v>

713
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:41.181
<v Speaker 3>in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida.</v>

714

<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

716
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what ended up happening was the reason </v>

717
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 3>why he did Ebi one was originally I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do the sub only worlds that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And Scotty from on the Mat,</v>

720
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.190
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew he was on board.</v>

721
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:56.610
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

722
00:33:56.611 --> 00:33:57.660
<v Speaker 3>that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

723
00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.130
<v Speaker 3>Me maybe a sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

724
00:33:59.131 --> 00:34:04.131
<v Speaker 3>but can I get my boy Gary Tonin in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure because we were going to do a </v>

725
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:04.131
<v Speaker 3>one slash 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one.</v>

726
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Sub only world one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 man bragging.</v>

727
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.550
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't even heard of you.</v>

728
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 3>How do you keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't keep track of,</v>

729
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.670
<v Speaker 3>of the top Jiu Jitsu guys.</v>

730
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about it either.</v>

731
00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:13.780
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

732
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I can barely keep track of the guys in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC.</v>

733
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.050
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get Gary Toner and I go,</v>

734
00:34:19.051 --> 00:34:24.051
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to do is get the best </v>

735
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:24.051
<v Speaker 3>submission guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

736
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about the best ib jj of </v>
<v Speaker 3>points guys.</v>

737
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't want points guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want submission guys because he's </v>

738
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

739
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sure?</v>

740
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was going to put him in as a </v>

741
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 3>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even,</v>

742
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sub only worlds.</v>

743
00:34:35.581 --> 00:34:40.581
<v Speaker 3>We had investors interested and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fell through and then by the time I was </v>

744
00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:44.880
<v Speaker 3>ready to start pushing it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided a victor got involved.</v>

745
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Victor Dobby loud from the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a Spanish commentators,</v>

746
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:49.050
<v Speaker 3>systematic Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got them all said,</v>

747
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.500
<v Speaker 3>let me be the unvested let me produce </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

748
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.720
<v Speaker 3>And it's called Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Invitational.</v>

749
00:34:54.721 --> 00:34:55.800
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

750
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.820
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he gets,</v>

751
00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.910
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to her to call it that for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognition he doesn't do.</v>

752
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.600
<v Speaker 3>People would know right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was his idea.</v>

753
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Ebi was his idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like calling up my name,</v>

754
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.600
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then as you think with a business </v>

755
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:11.600
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

756
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:11.970
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a good idea.</v>

757
00:35:11.971 --> 00:35:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Let me put myself out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

758
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.420
<v Speaker 3>and I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

759
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were gonna do,</v>

760
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Metamorris was already in the works and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be perfect.</v>

761
00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:19.440
<v Speaker 3>My name would be back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can boom,</v>

762
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.840
<v Speaker 3>we could piggyback off that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

763
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.450
<v Speaker 3>so I thought it was a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great strategy.</v>

764
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I have a well established name already </v>
<v Speaker 3>to try and build up something else.</v>

765
00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:32.241
<v Speaker 3>So much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the very first one we did one 70 and </v>

766
00:35:32.241 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 3>we did the featherweights too.</v>

767
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.310
<v Speaker 3>We're doing UFC weights and Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

768
00:35:35.311 --> 00:35:40.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going to be in sub only Scotty </v>

769
00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:40.311
<v Speaker 3>from under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt was involved in.</v>

770
00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:40.311
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my boy,</v>

771
00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to put them in.</v>

772
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.640
<v Speaker 3>And by that time I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

773
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I bjj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kuma Tay was out and I remembered who he</v>

774
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:51.531
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the guy that was Scotty </v>

775
00:35:51.531 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Nelson's boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then went to Abu Dhabi 2013.</v>

776
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time we met there,</v>

777
00:35:57.031 --> 00:36:02.031
<v Speaker 3>we were at the hotel lobby and I still </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know you were just like,</v>

778
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know it was like,</v>

779
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes on.</v>

780
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the greatest Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you didn't get the gold </v>

781
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.871
<v Speaker 3>medal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the greatest performances </v>

782
00:36:14.871 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 3>because that fight with chrome was </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely incredible.</v>

783
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 3>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you almost pulled it off,</v>

784
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:18.980
<v Speaker 3>but he ended up finishing it.</v>

785
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:24.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what made it crazy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's tricks and Sun and Hickson's </v>

786
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.501
<v Speaker 3>coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But after that you did the absolute 175 </v>

787
00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 3>pounds you want against Blue Shesha in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg.</v>

788
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Speaker 3>And those guys couldn't tap you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were going after them.</v>

789
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

790
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:35.770
<v Speaker 3>this is the guy that just almost look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the absolute,</v>

791
00:36:35.771 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 3>the smallest dude in the absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets the biggest.</v>

792
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.220
<v Speaker 3>He gets the two champions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyborg one,</v>

793
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.370
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the absolute ambush.</v>

794
00:36:43.371 --> 00:36:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Esha won the heavyweight class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they fought twice in the finals.</v>

795
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 3>One time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boucher,</v>

796
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:49.960
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one time cyborg wearing.</v>

797
00:36:49.961 --> 00:36:53.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's crazy in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he went against both of them.</v>

798
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.600
<v Speaker 3>God Damn sideboards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giant man.</v>

799
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Like it has to be like 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus at least.</v>

800
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he was doing the metamorris match </v>

801
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.030
<v Speaker 3>with sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

802
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.850
<v Speaker 3>this guy's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really strong.</v>

803
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Super technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good off his back,</v>

804
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 3>and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after that we're like,</v>

805
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

806
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 3>He's got some ridiculous guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you call it?</v>

807
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Tornado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tornado,</v>

808
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them in videos.</v>

809
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a tornado guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it's called?</v>

810
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Especially with the gies.</v>

851
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.860

<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

852
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

853
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 5>teacher Tom the blast and my original </v>
<v Speaker 5>teacher,</v>

854
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.900
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

855
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 5>he fought him in Abu Dhabi in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 5>2011,</v>

856
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.470
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess where was,</v>

857
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 5>which one was in Barcelona a doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter,</v>

858
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.620
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he thought of it.</v>

859
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.230
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

860
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:31.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a little studying on him just </v>

861
00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:31.231
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

862
00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:31.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

863
00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:31.231
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my teacher,</v>

864
00:39:31.231 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 5>we fought them and that it was a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial match,</v>

865
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.590
<v Speaker 5>like kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

866
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 5>when you look back at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like they kind of screwed Tom.</v>

867
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.430
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

868
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that for me,</v>

869
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 5>like I definitely was familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

870
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 5>I watched videos of him and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that after that.</v>

871
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.600
<v Speaker 5>But I'd say he'd made leaps and bounds </v>
<v Speaker 5>from that point.</v>

872
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.300
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

873
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.820
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't,</v>

874
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 5>I took his Jujitsu a little bit for </v>
<v Speaker 5>granted before that fight.</v>

875
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.860
<v Speaker 5>He in that Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

876
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.730
<v Speaker 5>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I felt like it was like the biggest,</v>

877
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a climax of his career for sure.</v>

878
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 5>In terms of his technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

879
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 5>it was on that if that event for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two trains hard.</v>

880
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely trends heart.</v>

881
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.270
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

882
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.930
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see a guy like that and you see</v>

883
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:12.910
<v Speaker 5>like those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those leaps and bounds,</v>

884
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you attribute that do?</v>

885
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 5>Do you attribute that to like the high </v>
<v Speaker 5>level Jujitsu that's available today?</v>

886
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.220
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has to kind of keep up.</v>

887
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.270
<v Speaker 5>What do you attribute it to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just I'm just like people.</v>

888
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 5>I think overall people getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

889
00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 5>We all admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

891
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.200

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

892
00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:34.201
<v Speaker 5>it's always going to be more so Garcia </v>
<v Speaker 5>in Hickson in his prime and so he's </v>

893
00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:34.870
<v Speaker 5>going be these guys that stand out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the guys that today it seems like if</v>

894

<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted to get into Jujitsu and </v>

895
00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:39.871
<v Speaker 5>watched submission grappling like the </v>

<v Speaker 5>nerds and my association and my </v>

899
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 5>homeschool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just,</v>

900
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.670
<v Speaker 5>every time I see a cool clip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time I see a cool clip of a new </v>

901
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.730
<v Speaker 5>transition that Jeff Glover put on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

902
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:57.830
<v Speaker 5>on instagram or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell my little Jujitsu,</v>

903
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 5>Gina says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see that one new,</v>

904
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 5>a half guard sweep seen it.</v>

905
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.120
<v Speaker 5>Like everyone just seem to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>new shit shit that I saw in a video and </v>

906
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:10.240
<v Speaker 5>I thought I might going to teach us </v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight and uh Oh,</v>

907
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:15.241
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've seen that video a thousand </v>

908
00:41:15.241 --> 00:41:17.851
<v Speaker 5>times and that was the only one that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to give us steel and move.</v>

909
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a beautiful thing about Jujitsu.</v>

910
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:23.200
<v Speaker 5>That's misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people think that it's a,</v>

911
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:27.400
<v Speaker 5>it has to do with strength and </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression and think of it as being like</v>

912
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 5>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But so many of the guys that do it,</v>

913
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.640
<v Speaker 5>they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they weren't doing this would be </v>

914
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 5>building computers or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talk about it all the time.</v>

915
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:41.681
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy how we could actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>dedicate this time to something that </v>

916
00:41:41.681 --> 00:41:43.820
<v Speaker 5>people actually care about and we could </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually make money or something,</v>

917
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:44.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

918
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

919
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 5>that's definitely more of the mindset </v>
<v Speaker 5>for most of them.</v>

920
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440
<v Speaker 5>There are those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

921
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 5>muscle head kept guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a few of those for sure.</v>

922
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.680
<v Speaker 5>But guys like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thoughtful,</v>

923
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:56.840
<v Speaker 5>intelligent guys seem to always rise to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the top.</v>

924
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:01.841
<v Speaker 5>They figure out how to always have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best answer to whatever problems in </v>

925
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 5>front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

926
00:42:03.171 --> 00:42:04.750
<v Speaker 5>that's what we're really looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

927
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.100
<v Speaker 5>that's the theory that I try to pass on </v>
<v Speaker 5>to my students and stuff.</v>

928
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

929
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:11.540
<v Speaker 5>as opposed to like I tell it at seminars</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

930
00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

931
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 5>if you're ever doing a move and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

932
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.080
<v Speaker 5>this isn't working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reasons probably not because you're </v>

933
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.080
<v Speaker 5>not pushing harder or you need to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>faster,</v>

934
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.030
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's not the reason something's </v>

935
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.030
<v Speaker 5>not working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because your techniques flawed,</v>

936
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it for his defense is good.</v>

937
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either or.</v>

938
00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot.</v>

939
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 5>That's one of those things that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

940
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 5>I always used to like laugh when people </v>
<v Speaker 5>would talk about it.</v>

941
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:36.770
<v Speaker 5>When it comes to a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques,</v>

942
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.420
<v Speaker 5>like some of you are rubber guard </v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques,</v>

943
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 5>that takes a long time to get flexible </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have to do the reps to pull them</v>

944
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 5>off and people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

945
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't work,</v>

946
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.400
<v Speaker 5>and we would always laugh like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

947
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 5>dad kicks work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn how to do a head kick right away.</v>

948
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.300
<v Speaker 5>Like this is a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

949
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.170
<v Speaker 5>Like head kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a wheel kick to the head.</v>

950
00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.720
<v Speaker 5>How long is that going to take someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>out?</v>

951
00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:01.860
<v Speaker 5>You can't say it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch the two or rockhold 5 million </v>

952
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.240
<v Speaker 5>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a lot of them.</v>

953
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 5>So in a lot of ways Jujitsu is is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything else,</v>

954
00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:12.101
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be these levels that </v>

955
00:43:12.101 --> 00:43:12.101
<v Speaker 5>you see of it that are super high and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you realize what's possible and you</v>

956
00:43:12.101 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

957
00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:17.711
<v Speaker 5>and then along the way you got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are second guessing a lot of </v>

958
00:43:17.711 --> 00:43:17.711
<v Speaker 5>doubters.</v>

959
00:43:17.711 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people that don't think this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to work or that's going to work,</v>

960
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.730
<v Speaker 5>there's just so many moves in Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's unlike any other sport.</v>

961
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.160
<v Speaker 5>It's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ever.</v>

962
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.670
<v Speaker 5>All the top guys have their own style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much to learn in.</v>

963
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:33.671
<v Speaker 5>The only way to get good at certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition or move is to spend a lot of </v>

964
00:43:33.671 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 5>time with that certain move or that </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition.</v>

965
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.120
<v Speaker 5>You don't have that much time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the smart thing to do,</v>

966
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.300
<v Speaker 5>it's because sometimes you're working on</v>
<v Speaker 5>a transition that might not pan out and </v>

967
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 5>you hit it a dead end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're like,</v>

968
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:48.431
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what moves to spend this </v>

969
00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:48.431
<v Speaker 5>precious time with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you look at the pop guys and what are</v>

970
00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:53.411
<v Speaker 5>they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They already done the research and </v>

971
00:43:53.411 --> 00:43:56.081
<v Speaker 5>development at works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now you know what safe to put reps </v>

972
00:43:56.081 --> 00:43:56.081
<v Speaker 5>into one.</v>

973
00:43:56.081 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 5>That's a safe one and the safe ones are </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best ones.</v>

974
00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the compliment to that though is</v>

975
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you look at that and I seen,</v>

976
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 5>I've seen people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that used to be on our team,</v>

977
00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:11.070
<v Speaker 5>it would look at these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the top guys do and focus on </v>

978
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:11.070
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you focus too much on it.</v>

979
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 5>Those top guys like let's take like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Menendez brothers for instance.</v>

980
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:14.900
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With like Baron Bolo,</v>

981
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

982
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys are doing a move that they've</v>

983
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:18.710
<v Speaker 5>perfected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

984
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sure I could study what they're doing</v>

985
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 5>and learn what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but am I going to be able to make.</v>

986
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Am I going to be able to make the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>headway that they have with that move?</v>

987
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:32.471
<v Speaker 5>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I probably need to pick up a </v>

988
00:44:32.471 --> 00:44:32.471
<v Speaker 5>different facet of my game and headway </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that move.</v>

989
00:44:32.471 --> 00:44:33.870
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's what I try to do.</v>

990
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's what I tell people that,</v>

991
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

992
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:37.000
<v Speaker 3>what's the best way to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

993
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:42.110
<v Speaker 3>a step forward in competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a step ahead of the game and I think </v>

994
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.651
<v Speaker 3>it's being somewhere being in a position</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than other people are in that </v>

995
00:44:45.651 --> 00:44:49.550
<v Speaker 3>position and developing that not so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see other people doing.</v>

996
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 3>If you're constantly just trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>what other people are doing,</v>

997
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.320
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get caught up in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>game and they'll always find a way to </v>

998
00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:57.320
<v Speaker 3>submit you because they've been doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

999
00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.640
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the like the opposing </v>

1000
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 3>strategy to what you were just talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about because I totally agree with you.</v>

1001
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

1002
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:08.510
<v Speaker 3>I use both strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always promote and push to keep your </v>

1003
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:12.590
<v Speaker 3>goto moves polished and not forget about</v>
<v Speaker 3>your goat tools.</v>

1004
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Those are your special moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime a new student comes,</v>

1005
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 3>a a new student comes to me and they see</v>
<v Speaker 3>them developing a move.</v>

1006
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's a move that I suck and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1007
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 3>that's your move right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remind them,</v>

1008
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's yours.</v>

1009
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Get really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your secret weapon.</v>

1010
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 3>You got to have secret weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time I have new students</v>

1011
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:34.101
<v Speaker 3>starting every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I like to expose them to everything </v>

1012
00:45:34.101 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 3>that's working out there and create </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own style.</v>

1013
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Even though personally I teach the baron</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullets part of our warmup system.</v>

1014
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ever going to be a bar polo </v>
<v Speaker 3>player.</v>

1015
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I messed with it every now and then when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rolling with a 12 year olds and </v>

1016
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.460
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the shit out of a white belt girl.</v>

1017
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1018
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 3>but I know eventually eventually I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get really good at that in like</v>

1019
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 3>10 years and then they'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack with it,</v>

1020
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.400
<v Speaker 3>but right now you stick to your Goto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep those strong and take your go tos </v>

1021
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.571
<v Speaker 3>to the highest level but also also have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a constant introduction of new stuff in </v>

1022
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:10.360
<v Speaker 3>your game.</v>

1023
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 3>It'll pay back later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 10 years down the road,</v>

1024
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 3>15 years down the road where maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not your game now,</v>

1025
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 3>but it will be after the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm killing it.</v>

1026
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:23.781
<v Speaker 3>You definitely need to take all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements from the good guys for what </v>

1027
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.181
<v Speaker 3>they do for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really no other martial art </v>

1028
00:46:26.181 --> 00:46:26.181
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1029
00:46:26.181 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 3>That has so many different moves too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just.</v>

1030
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:31.731
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a five dimensional martial </v>

1031
00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:31.731
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1032
00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just keeps getting better and </v>

1033
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 3>better at over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Joe was saying before,</v>

1034
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the progression of Jujitsu in general </v>

1035
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.351
<v Speaker 3>and the level of it is just going up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and I think the biggest innovations </v>

1036
00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:45.501
<v Speaker 3>that are happening now are probably in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the leg lock game frontier for you and </v>

1037
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Eddie and Eddie come into a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that big part of that.</v>

1038
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Since they want a 10 plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>

1039
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.400
<v Speaker 3>We have never outlawed a heel hooks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaping.</v>

1040
00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I just never wanted to get heavy on heel</v>
<v Speaker 3>hooks because I want her to train my </v>

1041
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.381
<v Speaker 3>fighters for MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them to the first habit to </v>

1042
00:47:06.381 --> 00:47:07.230
<v Speaker 3>go to heal hooks because it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous when the highest nine guys are</v>

1043
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 3>telling me when my leg lock school guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>are telling me,</v>

1044
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 3>manny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl,</v>

1045
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.200
<v Speaker 3>caren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Bro,</v>

1046
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.780
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA leg logs,</v>

1047
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 3>last resort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to give a position when </v>

1048
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 3>they're saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1049
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never discouraged it,</v>

1050
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 3>but I had leg lock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like [inaudible],</v>

1051
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.010
<v Speaker 3>one of my black belts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good at leg locks.</v>

1052
00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Denny got really good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I told denegall five years ago,</v>

1053
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 3>submerse yourself in leg locks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want.</v>

1054
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to do mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1055
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1056
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 6>leg locks are very important for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1057
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 6>but then when we saw what you did in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ebi,</v>

1058
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 6>one leg lock the shit out of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then in the grapplers quest,</v>

1059
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Speaker 6>ultimate absolute in the Obi wan and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>finals,</v>

1060
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 6>you beat Richie Martinez,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of my guys,</v>

1061
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 6>you heal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hook them inside hook.</v>

1062
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 6>And then at the grapplers quest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ultimate,</v>

1063
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:53.731
<v Speaker 6>absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or ultimate whatever submission only I </v>

1064
00:47:53.731 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 6>get those mixed up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was you and Nathan Orchard at the end</v>

1065
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 6>of that 16 man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>another one of my black belts.</v>

1066
00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 6>And you've got them with the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'll hook again.</v>

1067
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.600
<v Speaker 6>From that point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nathan decided,</v>

1068
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:06.601
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He started studying everything you were </v>

1069
00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:08.671
<v Speaker 6>doing and we to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never got deep into my.</v>

1070
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:14.770
<v Speaker 6>I got a good crippler or a game over </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever people call both legs reaped.</v>

1071
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 6>I got when I escaped the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go to that.</v>

1072
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm good at that.</v>

1073
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:23.430
<v Speaker 6>He'll hook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but generally I'm not good at heel </v>

1074
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.430
<v Speaker 6>hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never really looked into it.</v>

1075
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:27.720
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know the system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know the system until Nathan </v>

1076
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.570
<v Speaker 6>studied your personal game and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>showed it to me and I'm like,</v>

1077
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:36.660
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like rubber guard because people </v>

1078
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.151
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People think like rubber guard is just </v>

1079
00:48:39.151 --> 00:48:39.151
<v Speaker 6>reaching up and grabbing your legs and </v>
<v Speaker 6>hold on and throwing up an arm bar.</v>

1080
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 6>They don't realize there's our system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's all these positions as a path.</v>

1081
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:47.490
<v Speaker 6>I didn't realize it was this exact same </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing for when I first started training </v>

1082
00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:47.490
<v Speaker 6>leg locks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>

1083
00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.660
<v Speaker 6>I walked in like Eddie had already done </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of,</v>

1084
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>made a lot of headway in the leg lock </v>

1085
00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:54.680
<v Speaker 6>game and obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1086
00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:54.680
<v Speaker 6>John had been teaching him so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1087
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
<v Speaker 6>when I first came in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my intentions were always preparing for </v>

1088
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
<v Speaker 6>ADCC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1089
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.000
<v Speaker 6>my intentions were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

1090
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.250
<v Speaker 6>I want to know a little bit about this </v>
<v Speaker 6>leg lock game.</v>

1091
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be competing in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>tournament where he looks her legal,</v>

1092
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 6>which I don't usually do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1093
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.850
<v Speaker 6>I want to be ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1094
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 6>we're ready for whatever people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna throw me.</v>

1095
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:13.711
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to learn how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>well enough that I can defend it and </v>

1096
00:49:13.711 --> 00:49:16.440
<v Speaker 6>then I learned that it's like a whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>different martial art just like walks in</v>

1097
00:49:16.441 --> 00:49:17.440
<v Speaker 6>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

1098
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:22.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to ask John because I'm so </v>

1099
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.710
<v Speaker 6>frustrated I'm not passing Eddie's guard</v>
<v Speaker 6>because just keeps blocking me.</v>

1100
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you know,</v>

1101
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:25.990
<v Speaker 6>when a guy's good at lego logs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you pass the guard?</v>

1102
00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking learning logs dude.</v>

1103
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.480
<v Speaker 6>See you got to learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how to do what he's doing so that you </v>

1104
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:33.480
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the counters and everything.</v>

1105
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 6>So I realized I had to spend time on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1106
00:49:35.261 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 6>as opposed to just dismissing it as like</v>
<v Speaker 6>a small part.</v>

1107
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:42.930
<v Speaker 6>When you see someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you see someone dismiss them in </v>

1108
00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.121
<v Speaker 6>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the highest armed guy saying don't </v>

1109
00:49:45.121 --> 00:49:47.221
<v Speaker 6>do it because it's last resort,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then you see a guy like I was gonna </v>

1110
00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.380
<v Speaker 6>say that one you guys about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>

1111
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.580
<v Speaker 6>Like blocks today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>leg locks in mma.</v>

1112
00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:53.410
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think there needs to be.</v>

1113
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.350
<v Speaker 6>There's a few guys that are using them </v>
<v Speaker 6>well and I just,</v>

1114
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.380
<v Speaker 6>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1115
00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's just not enough people out there</v>

1116
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:05.191
<v Speaker 6>that are confident enough in them have </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done enough technical research to </v>

1117
00:50:05.191 --> 00:50:05.200
<v Speaker 6>make them useful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

1118
00:50:05.201 --> 00:50:07.090
<v Speaker 6>If you teach one dude is shitty healed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1119
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:12.091
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what do you think about as far as </v>

1120
00:50:12.091 --> 00:50:12.091
<v Speaker 6>specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's terrifying.</v>

1121
00:50:12.091 --> 00:50:14.290
<v Speaker 6>The guy knows that he has a confidence </v>
<v Speaker 6>in his heel,</v>

1122
00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:19.330
<v Speaker 6>hooking nosy can break a limb with it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he finds in every different </v>

1123
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.260
<v Speaker 6>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of our transitions we get from,</v>

1124
00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1125
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 6>Pahara got a leg there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got to like here,</v>

1126
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:28.051
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he learns how to get there from many </v>

1127
00:50:28.051 --> 00:50:28.051
<v Speaker 6>different positions and that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was talking about and kind of what Eddie</v>

1128
00:50:28.051 --> 00:50:28.051
<v Speaker 6>was</v>

1129
00:50:28.051 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 3>talking about with finding that thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like yours,</v>

1130
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's there all the time.</v>

1131
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 3>So if he can get you there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1132
00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:34.320
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1133
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.940
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1134
00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.090
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking he's already moved on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instance.</v>

1135
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.470
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leg locks is a,</v>

1136
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I hear this stuff from highest on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:50:42.301 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 3>I hear my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my purse,</v>

1139
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.680
<v Speaker 3>my first MMA fighter was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was rubber guard twister.</v>

1140
00:50:49.681 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 3>He lives like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1141
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I created this guy,</v>

1142
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:57.671
<v Speaker 3>but he also had a leg lock out any did </v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA and every time he tried to go for </v>

1143
00:50:57.671 --> 00:50:58.300
<v Speaker 3>leg locks he got knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.970
<v Speaker 3>So that came.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

1145
00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:02.210
<v Speaker 3>there was a point where uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to.</v>

1146
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 3>It was too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1147
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:04.770
<v Speaker 3>after like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

1148
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.630
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1149
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.010
<v Speaker 3>you have uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1150
00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Hussam [inaudible] coming out coming out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nowhere and people I think are still </v>

1151
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.710
<v Speaker 3>giving them more like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he's making the leg locks work </v>

1152
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 3>because he shows strong and he's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>

1153
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.900
<v Speaker 3>And so because people do feel like we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to see it a few more times from </v>

1154
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:22.900
<v Speaker 3>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1155
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 3>I hope leg lock works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more submissions on the ground,</v>

1156
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:30.641
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the way with smart pull in </v>

1157
00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:30.641
<v Speaker 3>garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the leg locks.</v>

1158
00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:31.340
<v Speaker 3>He's not even trying to take dudes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1159
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you know what I think is when Alan </v>
<v Speaker 3>belcher figured it out,</v>

1160
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alan belcher figured it out.</v>

1161
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean he willingly went into his half </v>
<v Speaker 3>guard.</v>

1162
00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 3>He willingly went to the ground with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest mistake.</v>

1163
00:51:41.091 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 3>People make up poems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He defended every single step of the way</v>

1164
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:46.220
<v Speaker 3>and then beat them down and stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the high level,</v>

1165
00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:51.221
<v Speaker 3>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if the guys is kind of shaky </v>

1166
00:51:51.221 --> 00:51:54.641
<v Speaker 3>about leg locks and he's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have leg lock defense in his </v>

1167
00:51:54.641 --> 00:51:54.641
<v Speaker 3>DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get caught.</v>

1168
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:59.860
<v Speaker 3>But Alan spent two months solid with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dean lister floorman a Davi Ramos who's </v>

1169
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 3>a mini pet horse leg and he said the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first two weeks he just got leg locked </v>

1170
00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.940
<v Speaker 3>all day and after a while you learn how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to slow it down and then you get tapped </v>

1171
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.040
<v Speaker 3>and you slow it down and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>tapped and you slow it down and then you</v>

1172
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:15.620
<v Speaker 3>start attacking because that's what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>

1173
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:20.890
<v Speaker 3>So I think maybe with the leg game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if everybody got really good at the </v>

1174
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:23.450
<v Speaker 3>defense that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get,</v>

1175
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.720
<v Speaker 3>you can get in these positions and avoid</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting hit because I think the saddle </v>

1176
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.680
<v Speaker 3>and the honeywell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty safe right where you</v>

1177
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 3>ain't going to get hit there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't reach you.</v>

1178
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.780
<v Speaker 3>But if the guy defends it and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable defending it and then can </v>

1179
00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 3>sit up in a certain spot and sprawl out </v>
<v Speaker 3>on you,</v>

1180
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.820
<v Speaker 3>then it could be a trouble.</v>

1181
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for leg locks and mma.</v>

1182
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not 100 percent I need is once </v>

1183
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:48.550
<v Speaker 3>the punches coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they start flying.</v>

1184
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I hear Ryan Hall is making leg lock </v>
<v Speaker 3>works in an MMA training.</v>

1185
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:56.080
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe like maybe leg locks,</v>

1186
00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:01.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be the future of or part of the </v>

1187
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:01.990
<v Speaker 3>future of grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

1188
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always have this conception but this </v>

1189
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:07.000
<v Speaker 3>idea of it because of Frank Mir versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ian Freeman.</v>

1190
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like cemented in people's heads.</v>

1191
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Remember Frank Mir is going for the heel</v>
<v Speaker 3>hook look like he's got it locked up.</v>

1192
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:17.050
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ian Friedman's teeing off on his face </v>

1193
00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:17.050
<v Speaker 3>while he's holding onto his leg that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1194
00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.230
<v Speaker 3>gets he stomped on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got fucked up that.</v>

1195
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 3>And that was when frank was a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1196
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:24.260
<v Speaker 3>frank was real young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild and aggressive.</v>

1197
00:53:24.261 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Romeo Santo and walking</v>

1198
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.170
<v Speaker 6>Hanson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Assad was very good at leg locks,</v>

1199
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 6>had a toehold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what can enhance and caught him once and</v>

1200
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.720
<v Speaker 6>hit them two or three times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was just how it started.</v>

1201
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.350
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1202
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:39.351
<v Speaker 6>who's caring?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's got better leg locked technique </v>

1203
00:53:39.351 --> 00:53:41.850
<v Speaker 6>imagery or Paul Harris because </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] has worked some dudes needs </v>

1204
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:46.071
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think in an Aria is probably more </v>

1205
00:53:46.071 --> 00:53:46.071
<v Speaker 6>technical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think?</v>

1206
00:53:46.071 --> 00:53:46.071
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no I,</v>

1207
00:53:46.071 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 6>no I didn't come and says no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1208
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 6>I think that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing kind of,</v>

1209
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing two people,</v>

1210
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do leg locks to people that are,</v>

1211
00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.080
<v Speaker 6>that don't have any clue what they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing when it comes to like locking,</v>

1212
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's in the MMA world,</v>

1213
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:07.011
<v Speaker 6>not to discredit anybody that uses them </v>
<v Speaker 6>effectively and under nay pars is using </v>

1214
00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:07.011
<v Speaker 6>them effectively in both.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1215
00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:08.940
<v Speaker 6>but then when you're watching people use</v>
<v Speaker 6>like locks and fights,</v>

1216
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 6>you can't just credit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can just be like,</v>

1217
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:15.501
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that dude's leg locks are amazing </v>

1218
00:54:15.501 --> 00:54:15.501
<v Speaker 6>because they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1219
00:54:15.501 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 6>in terms of grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going on somebody that doesn't </v>

1220
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:19.950
<v Speaker 6>have any clue what they're doing most of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the time anyway.</v>

1221
00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

1222
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 6>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1223
00:54:22.441 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 6>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's better,</v>

1224
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's clear that the headway that </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] is made with an outside,</v>

1225
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 6>he'll hook is just way above anyone </v>
<v Speaker 6>else.</v>

1226
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] has some other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd say men are better at some of these </v>

1227
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 6>technical transitions that he does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some very unique,</v>

1228
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>counters and unique,</v>

1229
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:40.230
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1230
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.550
<v Speaker 6>attacks entries as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:54:43.551 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 6>I mean we definitely study them and try </v>
<v Speaker 6>and use some of that stuff.</v>

1232
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:47.820
<v Speaker 6>So I think he's just a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 6>creative,</v>

1233
00:54:47.821 --> 00:54:50.150
<v Speaker 6>a little bit more unique,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think necessarily.</v>

1234
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 6>I think Paul Harris has a better system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1235
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:57.861
<v Speaker 6>Paul Harris has a better system for </v>
<v Speaker 6>breaking a limb as opposed to a lot of </v>

1236
00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.550
<v Speaker 6>creative transitions and can eventually </v>
<v Speaker 6>submit somebody.</v>

1237
00:54:59.551 --> 00:55:04.551
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you ever think about getting a </v>

1238
00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:04.810
<v Speaker 6>private with Paul Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1239
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:05.790
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I,</v>

1240
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I favor my knees and I don't want to </v>

1241
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 6>get.</v>

1242
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you definitely just break my legs for </v>

1243
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1244
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 6>he'd try anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd say,</v>

1245
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 6>oh for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>

1246
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:16.830
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guy's a crazy person.</v>

1247
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:20.070
<v Speaker 6>They brought in a sports psychologist to</v>
<v Speaker 6>try and like,</v>

1248
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:25.100
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why are you breaking your training </v>

1249
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:25.100
<v Speaker 6>partners legs and everybody's legs and </v>
<v Speaker 6>competition and not letting go.</v>

1250
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.340
<v Speaker 6>And the sports psychologist after week </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

1251
00:55:26.341 --> 00:55:28.800
<v Speaker 6>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the day brought him in</v>

1252
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:33.801
<v Speaker 6>because he was breaking his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his training partners to camps and </v>

1253
00:55:33.801 --> 00:55:33.801
<v Speaker 6>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

1254
00:55:33.801 --> 00:55:33.801
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1255
00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:37.620
<v Speaker 6>God Damn Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're nodding as well.</v>

1256
00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just wondered.</v>

1257
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:42.930
<v Speaker 6>Confirmation across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he had a tow childhood man.</v>

1258
00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 6>You hear about his childhood that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that big scar across his chest.</v>

1259
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:48.270
<v Speaker 6>They tried to Krazy glue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit's shut when he was like a kid.</v>

1260
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 6>He grew up on a farm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a pig slop,</v>

1262
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:52.230
<v Speaker 6>and he was like 13.</v>

1263
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.670
<v Speaker 6>It's a really heartbreaking story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not surprised at all.</v>

1264
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 6>Been working since he was like a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>kid.</v>

1265
00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the reasons why he's so </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking strong.</v>

1266
00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 6>Pig slop has something to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to start getting pixel up.</v>

1267
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:07.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you added some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Says Diet once you got some of them wake</v>

1268
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:12.570
<v Speaker 6>up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just super dense in protein.</v>

1269
00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 6>Tastes like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's good for your plus.</v>

1270
00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:20.031
<v Speaker 6>It's like an instant fecal transplant as</v>
<v Speaker 6>well because reading a little bit of </v>

1271
00:56:20.031 --> 00:56:20.031
<v Speaker 6>picture in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Perfect.</v>

1272
00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 6>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See his fight with Fitch.</v>

1273
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no I haven't.</v>

1274
00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 5>I've been watching a lot of highlights </v>
<v Speaker 5>specifically actually explained it.</v>

1275
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 5>Alan belcher actually went over like </v>
<v Speaker 5>what he did wrong.</v>

1276
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:37.190
<v Speaker 5>Like it's pretty interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a video outlining the technique,</v>

1277
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.170
<v Speaker 5>how to defend and how par has went to </v>
<v Speaker 5>straight leg lock.</v>

1278
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.640
<v Speaker 5>Nobody did and what he should or the way</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have done it.</v>

1279
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 5>And the way you did do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really interesting.</v>

1280
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:48.130
<v Speaker 5>Alan Belcher is a wizard when it comes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the way Paul Harris got the fight</v>

1281
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:49.490
<v Speaker 5>to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fighting John Fitch,</v>

1282
00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 5>Ncaa Division One wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did he take them down?</v>

1283
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.770
<v Speaker 5>He didn't even try,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just shot for a week,</v>

1284
00:56:56.771 --> 00:56:59.380
<v Speaker 5>single and just sat down and went for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>leg lock.</v>

1285
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.160
<v Speaker 5>Once he gets a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you have a whole new level of </v>

1286
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.761
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody has in their head like a </v>

1287
00:57:08.761 --> 00:57:08.761
<v Speaker 5>level of Oh fuck.</v>

1288
00:57:08.761 --> 00:57:08.761
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1289
00:57:08.761 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay here.</v>

1290
00:57:09.011 --> 00:57:12.250
<v Speaker 5>I can defend here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think he's so God damn strong.</v>

1291
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:14.770
<v Speaker 5>And on top of that it's technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sharp.</v>

1292
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.760
<v Speaker 5>Then went to grabs a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see this look on dudes faces.</v>

1293
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>

1294
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:23.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm not getting out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys are letting him get where he wants </v>

1295
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.670
<v Speaker 5>to be though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1296
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.900
<v Speaker 5>like most of them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1297
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the better strategy is to put him where </v>

1298
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 5>you want them as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1299
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to keep this on the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No you're not,</v>

1300
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.420
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to keep this on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet.</v>

1301
00:57:31.421 --> 00:57:33.120
<v Speaker 5>He's going to find a way to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>leg lock,</v>

1302
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.150
<v Speaker 5>lock guard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them,</v>

1303
00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:35.830
<v Speaker 5>put them down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put them down.</v>

1304
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 5>Shows you what a Demon Hector Lombard </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

1305
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.140
<v Speaker 5>Because Hector Lumbar was like getting a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold of my legs.</v>

1306
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.020
<v Speaker 5>He beat the shit out of him.</v>

1307
00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 5>How did the fight go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stoppage.</v>

1308
00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 5>Lombard stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just couldn't take them down.</v>

1309
00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:49.450
<v Speaker 5>Couldn't take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't get him into leg lock,</v>

1310
00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:51.310
<v Speaker 5>couldn't do anything with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never got him to the ground.</v>

1311
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 5>Did he try to pull dark to Lombard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is Stupid.</v>

1312
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:56.230
<v Speaker 5>Strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid,</v>

1313
00:57:56.231 --> 00:58:01.231
<v Speaker 5>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the only guy I've ever seen lockup </v>

1314
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:01.960
<v Speaker 5>with Tim Bush and just face plant him </v>
<v Speaker 5>just by,</v>

1315
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:06.990
<v Speaker 5>by polar like Tim Bush was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot and take them down and he sprawled</v>

1316
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 5>and just slammed him into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's so God damn strong.</v>

1317
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 5>And on top of that he's got ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique.</v>

1318
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.340
<v Speaker 5>You know his judo is off the charts and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he's got submissions to men.</v>

1319
00:58:19.341 --> 00:58:21.130
<v Speaker 5>There's a video of him in a submission.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grappling match.</v>

1320
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:22.990
<v Speaker 5>We snapped to dude's leg and you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>hear it.</v>

1321
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.150
<v Speaker 5>You could hear the snap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing grip.</v>

1322
00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:28.090
<v Speaker 5>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lombard.</v>

1323
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Hector Lombard gets a dude in a leg lock</v>
<v Speaker 5>and snaps his leg.</v>

1324
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 5>I think I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like you've got them in like a </v>

1325
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 5>straight ankle lock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you hear a crack number,</v>

1326
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.950
<v Speaker 5>John Lobur got his foot broken off with </v>
<v Speaker 5>a toehold in Japan.</v>

1327
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.970
<v Speaker 5>The whole foot just broke off and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>just looking at it.</v>

1328
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.320
<v Speaker 5>They flipped hanging and the ref stops </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1329
00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:46.210

1376

<v Speaker 6>little bit of a grappling based,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't a,</v>

01:00:25.451 --> 01:00:27.020
<v Speaker 6>like things in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing serious.</v>

1381
01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:29.960
<v Speaker 6>Nothing that I really remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I do wrestling privates with a d,</v>

1382
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:34.961
<v Speaker 6>One guy Matt Fletcher.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm on a biweekly to two a week.</v>

1383
01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:36.740
<v Speaker 6>And what kind of striking training </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing?</v>

1384
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.190
<v Speaker 6>Striking training has started working </v>
<v Speaker 6>with Frank Savannah,</v>

1385
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.950
<v Speaker 6>a boxing coach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's,</v>

1386
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm just doing it like once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1387
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 6>You don't have time to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am in Manhattan,</v>

1388
01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:48.140
<v Speaker 6>but I haven't checked anybody out in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>area.</v>

1389
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:53.141
<v Speaker 6>I've just been doing stuff in Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bringing people to me because I run a </v>

1390
01:00:53.141 --> 01:00:55.481
<v Speaker 6>school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's hard for me now because Enzo is </v>

1391
01:00:55.481 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 6>who's connected with a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1392
01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 6>Like Phil nurse doesn't want you guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>all somewhat somewhat connected.</v>

1393
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:04.480
<v Speaker 6>You have some guys teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

1394
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't gotten in touch with those </v>

1395
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:09.600
<v Speaker 6>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1396
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just a real basic level right now,</v>

1397
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 6>so I just want to get to a point where I</v>
<v Speaker 6>can start going to some professionals,</v>

1398
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:16.430
<v Speaker 6>but it's almost like with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>without knowing anything,</v>

1399
01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 6>like what uses it to go to the best guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the world,</v>

1400
01:01:18.621 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

1401
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.660
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what dude with a guy,</v>

1402
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:25.661
<v Speaker 6>as good as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the most important thing is you </v>

1403
01:01:25.661 --> 01:01:28.901
<v Speaker 6>go to like whoever you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you decided to embark on your mma </v>

1404
01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:30.500
<v Speaker 6>career,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to someone,</v>

1405
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 6>but it's got a full knowledge like a for</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rasa hobby type.</v>

1406
01:01:33.921 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1407
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.780
<v Speaker 6>someone's got a full knowledge of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guys are so gigantic.</v>

1408
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:40.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they get the credit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they deserve.</v>

1409
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Duke Roufus is of the world and you </v>

1410
01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:45.940
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

1411
01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.030
<v Speaker 6>those guys that just look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look at the whole package of what you do</v>

1412
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:49.820
<v Speaker 6>as a fighter and piece together the </v>
<v Speaker 6>right strategy for you.</v>

1413
01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 6>We have good connections with a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1414
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:54.230
<v Speaker 6>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for us and that camp,</v>

1415
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:59.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their guys come to us for Jujitsu and </v>

1416
01:01:59.231 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 6>our guys go down to them from me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm definitely hoping once I,</v>

1417
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 6>once I get some striking and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 6>boxing to a certain level,</v>

1418
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:03.890
<v Speaker 6>I'd love to go down there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1419
01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just so I feel like,</v>

1420
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almost they wouldn't know what to do </v>

1421
01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 6>with me at this point just because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>just so,</v>

1422
01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>base level right now.</v>

1423
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.860
<v Speaker 6>Useless to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to waste their time.</v>

1424
01:02:12.861 --> 01:02:15.100
<v Speaker 6>So you just turned the box from your </v>
<v Speaker 6>train more time.</v>

1425
01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:18.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm just boxing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My boxing coach told me that he thinks,</v>

1426
01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to spend about six months purely</v>

1427
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.340
<v Speaker 5>unboxing before I jump into Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1428
01:02:22.341 --> 01:02:25.000
<v Speaker 5>you could probably do it either way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's a good idea man.</v>

1429
01:02:25.001 --> 01:02:27.600
<v Speaker 5>He kind of contrast the two things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to teach you.</v>

1430
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 5>So focused on one thing first and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll jump into that for sure.</v>

1431
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get those mechanics down and then uh,</v>

1432
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 5>the trans transition is very important </v>
<v Speaker 5>though some people don't make it,</v>

1433
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:39.960
<v Speaker 5>don't make it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the guy has leg kicks are just,</v>

1434
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.170
<v Speaker 5>they come into play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the elbows and knees come into play.</v>

1435
01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:44.310
<v Speaker 5>There's too many things that come into </v>
<v Speaker 5>play.</v>

1436
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.700
<v Speaker 5>Guys make the mistake of focusing </v>
<v Speaker 5>primarily on boxing just because it </v>

1437
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.020
<v Speaker 5>feels good to punch somebody in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

1438
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.520
<v Speaker 5>Pretty good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an awkward movement for your </v>

1439
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.580
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seems pretty self explanatory.</v>

1440
01:02:56.581 --> 01:03:01.581
<v Speaker 5>Everybody understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then kicking is this whole thing </v>

1441
01:03:01.581 --> 01:03:03.560
<v Speaker 5>where you're moving your body in a way </v>
<v Speaker 5>that seemed awkward and you're,</v>

1442
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.650
<v Speaker 5>you have to think about where you're and</v>
<v Speaker 5>foot placement goes to some guys,</v>

1443
01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:09.530
<v Speaker 5>they just become that boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a wrestler,</v>

1444
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.940
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu type guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but can't do that anymore,</v>

1445
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1446
01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 5>It's just Vittori Belfort's we'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicking you in the head.</v>

1447
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.120
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like now it's on such a weird level</v>

1448
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:23.121
<v Speaker 5>that guys can do things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys that are like super high level and </v>

1449
01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:26.601
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll always have that advantage over </v>

1450
01:03:26.601 --> 01:03:26.601
<v Speaker 5>you in this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when your,</v>

1451
01:03:26.601 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 5>as you're planning out your future,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super important to look at all the </v>

1452
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 5>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some guys never do that,</v>

1453
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:35.061
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like no one ever expects shale son and </v>

1454
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:35.061
<v Speaker 5>throw a head kick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1455
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:39.770
<v Speaker 5>Like he's a good example of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one ever expected him to just never </v>

1456
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.340
<v Speaker 5>put that as a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was never.</v>

1457
01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 5>But like a guy like a GSP or fill in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>blank,</v>

1458
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:48.630
<v Speaker 5>they can kind of do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect example.</v>

1459
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 5>Mean you can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1460
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.870
<v Speaker 5>definitely makes you more dangerous for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1461
01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 5>If Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like professional Jujitsu was a big </v>

1462
01:03:58.350 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1463
01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.940
<v Speaker 5>It was on television,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a major league sport tour we're </v>

1464
01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.881
<v Speaker 5>trying to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But would you go into mma or would you </v>

1465
01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:05.250
<v Speaker 5>stay with you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an interesting question.</v>

1466
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.760
<v Speaker 5>I haven't really considered it yet </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we just haven't gotten it to </v>

1467
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:10.760
<v Speaker 5>that level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1468
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.870
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I would still try it at some </v>

1469
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.231
<v Speaker 5>point to transition into May.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I would hold it off for a little </v>

1470
01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:18.231
<v Speaker 5>bit longer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if I really,</v>

1471
01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:20.360
<v Speaker 5>if I really saw that the sport was </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking off and I,</v>

1472
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like that's where I could make my</v>

1473
01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:24.330
<v Speaker 5>headway and that's where I could make my</v>
<v Speaker 5>mark.</v>

1474
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.100
<v Speaker 5>I definitely spend a lot more time </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1475
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:31.220
<v Speaker 5>I still think I would like to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition and a purely for so purely </v>

1476
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:31.890
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a few reasons.</v>

1477
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to test myself,</v>

1478
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm at a new thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1479
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.500
<v Speaker 5>to make sure that I have the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 5>for when,</v>

1480
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody comes up to me and goes,</v>

1481
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.510
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to make a transition to mma from </v>

1482
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.510
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

1483
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.510
<v Speaker 5>What's your advice?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1484
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:45.780
<v Speaker 5>I can't really give them advice if I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>never done it before.</v>

1485
01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1486
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.930
<v Speaker 5>so I want to really know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

1487
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:53.931
<v Speaker 5>If I'm talking to these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these young guys that want to come up </v>

1488
01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:54.490
<v Speaker 5>and do something with an a instead of </v>
<v Speaker 5>just Jujitsu.</v>

1489
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.860
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely,</v>

1490
01:04:55.861 --> 01:05:00.861
<v Speaker 5>from a teaching perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to get into Nma and experience </v>

1491
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:00.980
<v Speaker 5>that and know what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1492
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:06.110
<v Speaker 5>that's how I feel anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regardless of whether or not Jujitsu </v>

1493
01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:06.110
<v Speaker 5>takes off and it's on tv and all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1494
01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 5>Are you planning on ever doing any </v>
<v Speaker 5>amateur boxing matches or anything along</v>

1495
01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:13.551
<v Speaker 5>those wild?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to talk to some of my coaches and </v>

1496
01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:13.551
<v Speaker 5>stuff and see what they think is best in</v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of,</v>

1497
01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:15.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my development and things like that.</v>

1498
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.320
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine that that probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1499
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 5>would be good for sure.</v>

1500
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1501
01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:24.511
<v Speaker 5>I want to avoid a as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going the route of just getting </v>

1502
01:05:24.511 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 5>knocked out all the time and training </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuff like that and just having that</v>

1503
01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 5>just gritty type of training where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just,</v>

1504
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.800
<v Speaker 5>it's just getting you tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1505
01:05:30.801 --> 01:05:35.801
<v Speaker 5>in quotation marks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I'll get to a point where I'm </v>

1506
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:35.801
<v Speaker 5>in a fight and I'm just getting touched </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the Chin and knocked out.</v>

1507
01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 5>I want to make sure I'm focusing mostly </v>
<v Speaker 5>on technical details and then putting it</v>

1508
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:44.401
<v Speaker 5>all together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So smart and so happy to hear you say </v>

1509
01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one of the most important things,</v>

1510
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 5>you know Jamie Varner just did this </v>
<v Speaker 5>interview recently,</v>

1511
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:52.320
<v Speaker 5>Jim Varner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was a former WEC lightweight </v>

1512
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:52.320
<v Speaker 5>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really tough guy,</v>

1513
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.780
<v Speaker 5>did this interview recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We said I shortened my career because I </v>

1514
01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 5>spar too hard as far too often our </v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger guys,</v>

1515
01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:03.350
<v Speaker 5>you started talking about I was sparring</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ryan Bader and all these dudes are way </v>

1516
01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:06.901
<v Speaker 5>bigger than him and that over those </v>
<v Speaker 5>years of doing all that sparring with </v>

1517
01:06:06.901 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 5>these larger guys and sporing really </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard three days a week.</v>

1518
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.940
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't try to prove you're tough,</v>

1519
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 5>you're tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the UFC.</v>

1520
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.130
<v Speaker 5>You really tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like don't just try to do it right.</v>

1521
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.380
<v Speaker 5>And he said sometimes you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to do with once a week,</v>

1522
01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 5>once every other week maybe even.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1523
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:23.881
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm thinking in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like when I get to the sparring and </v>

1524
01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:23.881
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

1525
01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 5>I used to spar back in the day like </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably like three,</v>

1526
01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:27.330
<v Speaker 5>four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1527
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1528
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:32.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of my teammates is starting to do </v>

1529
01:06:32.911 --> 01:06:34.340
<v Speaker 5>it some mma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just did it for fun and for some </v>

1530
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:34.340
<v Speaker 5>experience and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

1531
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 5>it was stupid and dangerous for me to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that without really knowing what I</v>

1532
01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 5>was doing in terms of striking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1533
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because all I was really doing,</v>

1534
01:06:40.721 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean all I was really doing was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1535
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.270
<v Speaker 5>hitting until I could get to a take </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway.</v>

1536
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:50.270
<v Speaker 5>But I mean just taking unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 5>damage for no reason from people that </v>

1537
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.270
<v Speaker 5>wanted to take my head off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1538
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:52.120
<v Speaker 5>it's not smart and people think it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>cute.</v>

1539
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:57.180
<v Speaker 5>They think it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guy doesn't even know how to </v>

1540
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:57.180
<v Speaker 5>box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once we touch them up,</v>

1541
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.960
<v Speaker 5>get in there and throw hard hooks on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your fucking head.</v>

1542
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 5>You don't even see them coming and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

1543
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.370
<v Speaker 5>those shots that you take in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>sparring sessions,</v>

1544
01:07:03.371 --> 01:07:05.770
<v Speaker 5>they could really fuck you up now for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>

1545
01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 5>The lad that had never really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1546
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have to pay the price for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

1547
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.700
<v Speaker 5>If you could find guys that sparked </v>
<v Speaker 5>technically really fast and have good </v>

1548
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 5>control of man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can progress so far.</v>

1549
01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:21.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it takes away all the fear of </v>

1550
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:23.791
<v Speaker 5>getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just find like it's just hard to </v>

1551
01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:23.791
<v Speaker 5>find the ties apparently have a down.</v>

1552
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.870
<v Speaker 5>I was talking with John Wayne par when </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was on the podcast and he said they,</v>

1553
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:31.980
<v Speaker 5>they spar like they play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when they're kicking each other </v>

1554
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.491
<v Speaker 5>though like slapping each other and </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's fighting every week so </v>

1555
01:07:35.491 --> 01:07:38.701
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when they're sparring they're like </v>

1556
01:07:38.701 --> 01:07:38.701
<v Speaker 5>playing with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's trying to hurt anybody.</v>

1557
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:44.030
<v Speaker 5>It should always be like that and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the biggest problem for people </v>

1558
01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.681
<v Speaker 5>starting out in training Jiu Jitsu to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get that guy that's just squeezes </v>

1559
01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:47.830
<v Speaker 5>everything and you need to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>relax,</v>

1560
01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:52.831
<v Speaker 5>get submitted and move around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to be comfortable and all </v>

1561
01:07:52.831 --> 01:07:52.831
<v Speaker 5>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1562
01:07:52.831 --> 01:07:56.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like a hard thing for me to teach </v>
<v Speaker 5>new people coming in and it's like the </v>

1563
01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.511
<v Speaker 5>hardest transition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get them to a point where they're </v>

1564
01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:00.850
<v Speaker 5>comfortable enough to relax and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>just let their mind open up to like what</v>

1565
01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:01.950
<v Speaker 5>they should be doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1566
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.690
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it's just time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the only thing that fixes that time</v>

1567
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:10.890
<v Speaker 5>and everything and striking to and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>see guys that trained for a long time </v>

1568
01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:14.821
<v Speaker 5>and maintain that mentality and still </v>
<v Speaker 5>are just like you did just rough and </v>

1569
01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 5>tough guys that are trying as hard as </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can,</v>

1570
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 6>every single role and they're not making</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of progress.</v>

1571
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.680
<v Speaker 6>I see plenty of people like that so time</v>
<v Speaker 6>but with good direction from like </v>

1572
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.820
<v Speaker 6>coaches and teammates and things like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that because there's still plenty of </v>

1573
01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.550
<v Speaker 6>guys that you could be training for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years and you're just still trained like</v>

1574
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:33.551
<v Speaker 6>a jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's a lot of those guys that </v>

1575
01:08:33.551 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 6>never really developed much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much offense either.</v>

1576
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:37.280
<v Speaker 6>They have like a couple of good moves </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they look glad to.</v>

1577
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.880
<v Speaker 6>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then some people just figured out </v>

1578
01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.091
<v Speaker 6>how to get like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many years were you doing Jiu Jitsu </v>

1579
01:08:46.091 --> 01:08:46.091
<v Speaker 6>will you started hitting like a real </v>
<v Speaker 6>high level?</v>

1580
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I think,</v>

1581
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1582
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a progression.</v>

1583
01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 6>I was focused on like points Jujitsu for</v>
<v Speaker 6>a long time.</v>

1584
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:58.151
<v Speaker 6>I was still trying to submit people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my strategy was I'm going to get to the </v>

1585
01:08:58.151 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 6>back because there's a high score for </v>
<v Speaker 6>points there and I could do a rear naked</v>

1586
01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 6>choke,</v>
<v Speaker 6>said you highly effective submission and</v>

1587
01:09:03.891 --> 01:09:04.910
<v Speaker 6>it's low risk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1588
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.320
<v Speaker 6>so that was my strategy for everything.</v>

1589
01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.320
<v Speaker 6>So the first five years of my training </v>
<v Speaker 6>was all dedicated to that from every </v>

1590
01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:11.320
<v Speaker 6>position.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's get to this guy's back,</v>

1591
01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 6>choke him from behind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>keep this simple,</v>

1592
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:15.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to have more points and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be able to submit.</v>

1593
01:09:15.621 --> 01:09:17.820
<v Speaker 6>The guy passed that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those,</v>

1594
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:22.870
<v Speaker 6>these last three years I think I've made</v>
<v Speaker 6>the biggest developments in terms of </v>

1595
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:26.231
<v Speaker 6>like broadening my submission base and </v>
<v Speaker 6>learning how to submit people from </v>

1596
01:09:26.231 --> 01:09:29.111
<v Speaker 6>different places and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think it was kind of good for my </v>

1597
01:09:29.111 --> 01:09:29.111
<v Speaker 6>progression,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1598
01:09:29.111 --> 01:09:33.010
<v Speaker 6>because I got positionally sound in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of different and had like a </v>

1599
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:33.010
<v Speaker 6>strategy and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it,</v>

1600
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:36.110
<v Speaker 6>it took till I was a black belt to </v>
<v Speaker 6>really make advances.</v>

1601
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:37.550
<v Speaker 6>And in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like,</v>

1602
01:09:37.551 --> 01:09:38.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>high level,</v>

1603
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:43.810
<v Speaker 6>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you feel about what submission </v>

1604
01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 6>only versus the points game?</v>

1605
01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1606
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.320
<v Speaker 6>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it takes a couple of different things,</v>

1607
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:48.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1608
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:54.310
<v Speaker 6>so I mean you could see people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>possibly successful in both are </v>

1609
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.500
<v Speaker 6>successful in one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1610
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.560
<v Speaker 6>but I think what it comes down to is </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of the mentality of the person </v>

1611
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.500
<v Speaker 6>that's training or competing in either </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those things,</v>

1612
01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:05.501
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you take somebody and whether </v>

1613
01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:05.501
<v Speaker 6>they're appoints fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there are points,</v>

1614
01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.670
<v Speaker 6>spider competing in a submission only </v>
<v Speaker 6>tournament,</v>

1615
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:12.730
<v Speaker 6>they're going to pretty much see them </v>
<v Speaker 6>take the same strategy and the </v>

1616
01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:12.730
<v Speaker 6>submission only toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1617
01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:13.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1618
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:19.090
<v Speaker 6>it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it takes guys that are constantly </v>

1619
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:19.090
<v Speaker 6>hunting for submissions in training.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1620
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:23.740
<v Speaker 6>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when you're gonna see the best </v>

1621
01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:23.740
<v Speaker 6>matches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1622
01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 6>guys that are constantly hunting after </v>
<v Speaker 6>submissions all the time.</v>

1623
01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:26.840
<v Speaker 6>It's not just like a situational thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like this,</v>

1624
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.590
<v Speaker 6>there's just this overarching thing that</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of the bigger Jujitsu guys say.</v>

1625
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:33.720
<v Speaker 6>I think I saw like an article from Kyle </v>
<v Speaker 6>Taylor and I love dietary,</v>

1626
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:35.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a great guy,</v>

1627
01:10:35.241 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 6>but he posted this thing that said like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1628
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.480
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1629
01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1630
01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.740
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate when people talk about submission</v>

1631
01:10:42.741 --> 01:10:45.420
<v Speaker 6>fighters and points fighters and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1632
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.940
<v Speaker 6>the difference between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think it's like the points fetters</v>

1633
01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.210
<v Speaker 6>was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all the same,</v>

1634
01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and these guys talk about,</v>

1635
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:57.100
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to use my Jujitsu and if a </v>

1636
01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:57.100
<v Speaker 6>submission opens up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to,</v>

1637
01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 6>I'll finish the guy if the submission </v>
<v Speaker 6>opens up.</v>

1638
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.310
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you make the fucking submission open up.</v>

1639
01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.600
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like,</v>

1640
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:07.630
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm waiting for this guy to like </v>

1641
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.630
<v Speaker 6>accidentally stick his arm out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1642
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 6>I make them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I take his arm away from him.</v>

1643
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.920
<v Speaker 6>That's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1644
01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's two complete.</v>

1645
01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.340
<v Speaker 6>Those are two different mentalities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1646
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1647
01:11:13.681 --> 01:11:18.681
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to wait for this guy to make a</v>
<v Speaker 6>mistake and I'm going to make this guy </v>

1648
01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:18.681
<v Speaker 6>in danger.</v>

1649
01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:19.410
<v Speaker 6>That's a newer mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1650
01:11:19.411 --> 01:11:24.411
<v Speaker 6>Because the original mentality was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the reasons why I would favor a </v>

1651
01:11:24.411 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 6>longer matches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you wanted to cook his opponent and want</v>

1652
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 6>to slow them down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wanting to make them make mistakes,</v>

1653
01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 6>didn't have the physicality to impose </v>
<v Speaker 6>himself on people.</v>

1654
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:34.800
<v Speaker 6>So he waited until they got tired and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then they would give something up and it</v>

1655
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 6>can work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1656
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think it's not a winning </v>
<v Speaker 6>strategy.</v>

1657
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:40.580
<v Speaker 6>You can see clearly you see guys grind </v>
<v Speaker 6>people out them.</v>

1658
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:44.640
<v Speaker 6>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that not just using strength,</v>

1659
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 6>you can find ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1660
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:47.420
<v Speaker 6>open up submissions on people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1661
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:52.470
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's definitely a deeper level of </v>

1662
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.470
<v Speaker 6>technique there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1663
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:53.490
<v Speaker 6>That's why the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way Josh Barnett describes it,</v>

1664
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>describe submissions in the way,</v>

1665
01:11:55.741 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 6>like some more technical jujitsu based </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys would describe submissions.</v>

1666
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.650
<v Speaker 6>Like Barnett always calls like catch </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling,</v>

1668
01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.810
<v Speaker 6>like a violent art that elect your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

1669
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.100
<v Speaker 6>your attack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not the gentle art to just use a </v>

1670
01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:10.100
<v Speaker 6>general art catch wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the violent art.</v>

1671
01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.620
<v Speaker 6>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the young guys like yourself,</v>

1672
01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:14.880
<v Speaker 6>super aggressive gods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like,</v>

1673
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.590
<v Speaker 6>there's like a change in philosophy then</v>
<v Speaker 6>more adherent to that philosophy,</v>

1674
01:12:19.591 --> 01:12:21.750
<v Speaker 6>like the aggressive go after it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Philosophy.</v>

1675
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:26.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think when we're talking about </v>

1676
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.870
<v Speaker 6>taking grappling to a point where it's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>spectator sport,</v>

1677
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.500
<v Speaker 6>which is what Eddie's trying to do in </v>
<v Speaker 6>many of these other organizations,</v>

1678
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 6>that's what needs to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's,</v>

1679
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 6>whether it's going to help you win </v>
<v Speaker 6>fights or not.</v>

1680
01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.720
<v Speaker 6>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you take a look at the UFC and Dana </v>

1681
01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:38.720
<v Speaker 6>White's always telling people like you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to have exciting fights,</v>

1682
01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 6>you have to have exciting fights and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's true because you won't have as many</v>

1683
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 6>fans if you don't heal eventually kick </v>
<v Speaker 6>you out of the UFC if you don't.</v>

1684
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's what makes it a Spec it.</v>

1685
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:51.350
<v Speaker 6>That's why people get paid to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because people are excited to watch it </v>

1686
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:53.190
<v Speaker 6>and whether you win or lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can't be the only thing in your head.</v>

1687
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.600
<v Speaker 6>I'm at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If when we're talking about bringing </v>

1688
01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:58.600
<v Speaker 6>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're making money,</v>

1689
01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.820
<v Speaker 6>you're putting on a performance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1690
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
<v Speaker 6>so it has to be about the attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has to be about what's exciting about</v>

1691
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the submission,</v>

1692
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So people constantly getting attacked.</v>

1693
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 6>That's what people want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's going to make this like a big</v>

1694
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 6>thing that people are interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you still interested in competing in</v>

1695
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:15.190
<v Speaker 6>the GE or you're just doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm also competing against.</v>

1696
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 6>I just don't focus on it because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 6>pays anybody to compete in the G.</v>

1697
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.100
<v Speaker 6>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let them.</v>

1698
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:20.730
<v Speaker 6>Morris does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:25.750
<v Speaker 6>Most and most of the matches don't ended</v>
<v Speaker 6>the submission and they're considered </v>

1700
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:27.310
<v Speaker 6>boring matches the most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying all dot matter.</v>

1701
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 6>Metamora should go all Nogi what's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1702
01:13:29.761 --> 01:13:30.320
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1703
01:13:30.321 --> 01:13:30.960
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

1704
01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't necessarily think that you can't</v>

1705
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:38.631
<v Speaker 6>have excited matches in the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think you have to find the right </v>

1706
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:41.421
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to find two people that are </v>

1707
01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:43.371
<v Speaker 6>willing to put it all on the line and </v>
<v Speaker 6>just try to submit each other and not </v>

1708
01:13:43.371 --> 01:13:43.371
<v Speaker 6>give a shit whether or not they get </v>
<v Speaker 6>submitted.</v>

1709
01:13:43.371 --> 01:13:45.300
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even when you find people like that,</v>

1710
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:50.510
<v Speaker 6>when one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they both have a grip of the color </v>

1711
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:52.680
<v Speaker 6>and the stuck there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're really good at just holding each</v>

1712
01:13:52.681 --> 01:13:54.530
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1713
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 6>it's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1714
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.120
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

1715
01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:59.190
<v Speaker 6>I think it just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just makes it more exciting,</v>

1716
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:00.800
<v Speaker 6>more smashing the game.</v>

1717
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:01.680
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1718
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.500
<v Speaker 6>I'd consider it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it would take out a bigger camp,</v>

1719
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:05.460
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1720
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:06.630
<v Speaker 6>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1721
01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm definitely just focused on Nogi </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now for everything in my future.</v>

1722
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 6>It's just like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I'm going to do MNA,</v>

1723
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:13.500
<v Speaker 6>it only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1724
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:18.990
<v Speaker 6>every match,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every super fight that I'm being asked </v>

1725
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:18.990
<v Speaker 6>to do is without the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just literally at this point makes no</v>

1726
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:20.470
<v Speaker 6>sense for me to spend a lot of time on </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1727
01:14:20.471 --> 01:14:21.520
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once again,</v>

1728
01:14:21.521 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 6>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from an instructional standpoint,</v>

1729
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.130
<v Speaker 6>your students that might be interested </v>
<v Speaker 6>in training and the gate at some point.</v>

1730
01:14:27.131 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 6>Once I break away from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1731
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 6>my athletic career,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll definitely study the geo.</v>

1732
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.020
<v Speaker 6>Definitely studied judo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely study all the things that,</v>

1733
01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.780
<v Speaker 6>those little intricacies that people use</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Jujitsu,</v>

1734
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:40.450
<v Speaker 6>the lapel guards and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that I can better help my students,</v>

1735
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 6>but not so much for me as a professional</v>
<v Speaker 6>athlete.</v>

1736
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:47.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think at this point we're hitting a </v>

1737
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.910
<v Speaker 6>point in Jujitsu where you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 6>a decision.</v>

1738
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:50.220
<v Speaker 6>What am I going to specialize in?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1739
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.630
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm going to specialize in Nogi </v>
<v Speaker 6>submission,</v>

1740
01:14:52.631 --> 01:14:57.631
<v Speaker 6>grappling with Marcello.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never rolled with Marcello </v>

1741
01:14:57.631 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 6>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been,</v>

1742
01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:58.560
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1743
01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:03.630
<v Speaker 6>he's been injured.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he's coming back now pretty </v>

1744
01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:05.200
<v Speaker 6>strong from what happened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got his knee hurt doing something.</v>

1745
01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:07.630
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a hundred percent sure what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe snowboarding.</v>

1746
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1747
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 6>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Perfect.</v>

1748
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:14.470
<v Speaker 6>He loves really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome dude.</v>

1749
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.500
<v Speaker 6>Once you will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually you'll,</v>

1750
01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:16.440
<v Speaker 6>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll do it.</v>

1751
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.900
<v Speaker 6>I've been skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1752
01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.970
<v Speaker 6>it's different when you're going </v>
<v Speaker 6>sideways.</v>

1753
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.780
<v Speaker 6>Was it different?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's first of all to better.</v>

1754
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.010
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1755
01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:25.820
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's better really.</v>

1756
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:28.520
<v Speaker 6>Once you go snowboarding for years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't go back.</v>

1757
01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.180
<v Speaker 6>For years I was snowboarding like when I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was like back to guy was like,</v>

1758
01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.130
<v Speaker 6>I was skiing for losers on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>snowboard.</v>

1759
01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:38.380
<v Speaker 6>Snowboard is so much cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I do it for like four or five years,</v>

1760
01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:39.050
<v Speaker 6>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1761
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:40.150
<v Speaker 6>once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>twice a year,</v>

1762
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>family would go on trips or whatever.</v>

1763
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.050
<v Speaker 6>And then one year my friends like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1764
01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:46.240
<v Speaker 6>you gotta try out scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1765
01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:51.241
<v Speaker 6>see how you see how you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like now at snowboarding I was at a </v>

1766
01:15:51.241 --> 01:15:51.580
<v Speaker 6>level,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my strategy snowboarding as fast</v>

1767
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:56.581
<v Speaker 6>as I possibly fucking could in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>straight line going down the hill and </v>

1768
01:15:56.581 --> 01:15:57.340
<v Speaker 6>then fall to stop myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>

1769
01:15:57.490 --> 01:15:59.460
<v Speaker 6>Sounds like getting almost knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1770
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.410
<v Speaker 6>falling into the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How fast are you going?</v>

1771
01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:03.400
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

1772
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 6>And I'm only going like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1773
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.360
<v Speaker 6>bunny slopes or like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1774
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:07.450
<v Speaker 6>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

1775
01:16:07.451 --> 01:16:09.280
<v Speaker 6>the blue squares,</v>
<v Speaker 6>intermediate,</v>

1776
01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:14.281
<v Speaker 6>whatever I could never do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was fearful of a black black diamonds </v>

1777
01:16:14.281 --> 01:16:15.070
<v Speaker 6>straight down I saw put on skis.</v>

1778
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.890
<v Speaker 6>I put on skis the first time I try it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Black diamond,</v>

1779
01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 6>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1780
01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:20.050
<v Speaker 6>It's like it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1781
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:21.910
<v Speaker 6>I mean clearly you're not doing it </v>
<v Speaker 6>technically,</v>

1782
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.920
<v Speaker 6>but like it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1783
01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:25.480
<v Speaker 6>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like comfortable,</v>

1784
01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:30.481
<v Speaker 6>like at slow myself down snowboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just feel like you're looking in one </v>

1785
01:16:30.481 --> 01:16:30.520
<v Speaker 6>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just tunnel vision.</v>

1786
01:16:30.521 --> 01:16:32.350
<v Speaker 6>You're going as fast as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so.</v>

1787
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 6>It's so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uncontrolled is difficult.</v>

1788
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.200
<v Speaker 6>So what you're saying is snowboarding is</v>
<v Speaker 6>more exciting.</v>

1789
01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.170
<v Speaker 6>I think there for a thrill seeking point</v>
<v Speaker 6>of view.</v>

1790
01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.600
<v Speaker 6>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels more dangerous to me.</v>

1791
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:48.601
<v Speaker 6>You're locked into this board.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have your two legs to be able </v>

1792
01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:51.421
<v Speaker 6>to separate and balance there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So often the snowboarders collide with </v>

1793
01:16:51.421 --> 01:16:54.601
<v Speaker 6>each other if you're going that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I'm on the slopes is the high much </v>

1794
01:16:54.601 --> 01:16:58.900
<v Speaker 6>higher percentage than everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you just got to learn to turn inside</v>

1795
01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.380
<v Speaker 6>because really snowboarding and skiing </v>
<v Speaker 6>is just the art of slowing down,</v>

1796
01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:03.490
<v Speaker 6>brake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brake,</v>

1797
01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.640
<v Speaker 6>brake and slowing down and slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Slowing down because as soon as you </v>

1798
01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:08.640
<v Speaker 6>don't slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1799
01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 6>you go down like a Ronnie Bono.</v>

1800
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to Marcello.</v>

1801
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would he be?</v>

1802
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Someone that I think personally has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu fan you against Marsala would be</v>

1803
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:23.430
<v Speaker 3>the most interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if that was metamorris yeah,</v>

1804
01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never superfight Ebi.</v>

1805
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd never call them out or anything.</v>

1806
01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:32.291
<v Speaker 3>You just don't have any right to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to be an amazing </v>

1807
01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:32.291
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that matchup.</v>

1808
01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm rematch with chrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1809
01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I asked for it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

1810
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:38.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't really call crone out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beat me so I,</v>

1811
01:17:38.261 --> 01:17:39.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called them out in a sense like,</v>

1812
01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:40.430
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to fight you,</v>

1813
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:45.431
<v Speaker 3>but I would never talk shit about chrome</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try and get them to fight me because </v>

1814
01:17:45.431 --> 01:17:45.431
<v Speaker 3>it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not fair.</v>

1815
01:17:45.431 --> 01:17:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you mean</v>

1816
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>made that match was the finish that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>that match and it made the match for </v>

1817
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1818
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like it made the match so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting than if you guys just went to a</v>

1819
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:59.191
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went to a stalemate at the end </v>

1820
01:17:59.191 --> 01:18:01.580
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were both clenched up with each </v>

1821
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:01.580
<v Speaker 1>other and it ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would've not been as good with.</v>

1822
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.990
<v Speaker 1>That was a perfect example of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible at high level Jujitsu.</v>

1823
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:06.220
<v Speaker 1>So exciting.</v>

1824
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he did submit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you blew up.</v>

1825
01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.350
<v Speaker 1>You put him in some terrible positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1827
01:18:13.351 --> 01:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had him in some bad spots.</v>

1828
01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.030
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1829
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:20.360
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and I went off about it.</v>

1830
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.700
<v Speaker 1>We watched the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We was there alive.</v>

1831
01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1832
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.710
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1833
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.830
<v Speaker 3>we were all crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1834
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:29.170
<v Speaker 3>is he gonna beat crone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1835
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.740
<v Speaker 3>and then one minute left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was chrome.</v>

1836
01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.000
<v Speaker 3>They broke you guys up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked at Hixson.</v>

1837
01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Does a video of you explaining</v>

1838
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Gary and then we play the video of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight on the Internet.</v>

1839
01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 1>It's on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1840
01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool that like,</v>

1842
01:18:45.531 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>something like that exists and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we need to have more of those</v>

1843
01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:51.190
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually Hollywood people are</v>

1844
01:18:51.191 --> 01:18:51.860
<v Speaker 1>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1845
01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1846
01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

1847
01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.200
<v Speaker 1>This is wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1848
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has this locked down.</v>

1849
01:18:56.481 --> 01:19:01.481
<v Speaker 1>This isn't on television for the UFC has</v>
<v Speaker 1>established a very firm like huge </v>

1850
01:19:01.481 --> 01:19:04.010
<v Speaker 1>property in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what everybody connects with</v>

1851
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:09.011
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA equals UFC and if you're fighting </v>

1852
01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:09.011
<v Speaker 1>for Bella tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1853
01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:12.700
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to be fight for the UFC </v>

1854
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:12.700
<v Speaker 1>someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just what it is.</v>

1855
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.700
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that with grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

1856
01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1857
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 3>How many times have you heard a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to?</v>

1858
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:17.810
<v Speaker 3>2,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000.</v>

1859
01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2000.</v>

1860
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:23.681
<v Speaker 3>Two guys that were already deeply into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC was we saw a 93.</v>

1861
01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 3>It's 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2001.</v>

1862
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Even to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You run into guys that aren't into it </v>

1863
01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:32.350
<v Speaker 3>and they've seen it a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a couple dudes rolling around.</v>

1864
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uneventful for them.</v>

1865
01:19:33.681 --> 01:19:36.460
<v Speaker 3>For them it was uneventful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when we saw it,</v>

1866
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.120
<v Speaker 3>what did we see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the difference?</v>

1867
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 3>The difference was the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament.</v>

1868
01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:45.190
<v Speaker 3>The first one I saw was UFC two and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was $60 tournament because it ends up </v>

1869
01:19:45.801 --> 01:19:47.660
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see one match at a time,</v>

1870
01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:52.661
<v Speaker 3>it's like a documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see maybe that first round you </v>

1871
01:19:52.661 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know one looks familiar,</v>

1872
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 3>but that second round you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

1873
01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 3>that dude with the long hair against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Ninja Dude.</v>

1874
01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:59.720
<v Speaker 3>And then the semifinals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you're like,</v>

1875
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's that?</v>

1876
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Gonna work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just saw their career that night and</v>

1877
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.690
<v Speaker 3>then the finals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy Saint,</v>

1878
01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Patrick Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1879
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went from hating hoists in the opening</v>

1880
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:15.171
<v Speaker 3>round because he beat my karate guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rooting for him and just being as </v>

1881
01:20:15.171 --> 01:20:16.380
<v Speaker 3>follower right there at that final,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I.</v>

1882
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Pat Smith was kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1883
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:21.240
<v Speaker 3>he was like a heel even within that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a movie.</v>

1884
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:26.330
<v Speaker 3>That's why we got to work with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that watch it back then got </v>

1885
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with it instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the greatest thing ever.</v>

1886
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>If they would have been single matches </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't know those dudes,</v>

1887
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 3>it would probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't have that drama unfold.</v>

1888
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.710
<v Speaker 3>There's just be a bunch of single </v>
<v Speaker 3>matches so you can't.</v>

1889
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't do that with mma,</v>

1890
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.090
<v Speaker 3>but you can totally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you did too.</v>

1891
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:50.091
<v Speaker 3>And that's why Abu Dhabi is so special </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a bunch of 16 man brackets </v>

1892
01:20:50.091 --> 01:20:54.500
<v Speaker 3>supervised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only thing that I think Abu </v>

1893
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Dhabi should have a $60 bracket habit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like four days,</v>

1894
01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 3>like a whole week.</v>

1895
01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:57.900
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every day is a different one because the</v>

1896
01:20:57.901 --> 01:21:01.470
<v Speaker 3>way they do it now it's like it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching three movies at the same time.</v>

1897
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 3>You're not watching it unfold and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet you just watch a link of</v>

1898
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:07.950
<v Speaker 3>the finals and then you go back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch a semifinal.</v>

1899
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching a movie in pieces and</v>

1900
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:15.741
<v Speaker 3>you already know the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what what metamorris does is have a </v>

1901
01:21:15.741 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 3>single fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every fight is his main stage.</v>

1902
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:21.160
<v Speaker 3>There's three matches or 12 matches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the moon deals.</v>

1903
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:25.230
<v Speaker 3>It's one match at a time showcase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a tournament style.</v>

1904
01:21:25.231 --> 01:21:30.231
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm trying to do is I took the </v>

1905
01:21:30.231 --> 01:21:32.811
<v Speaker 3>best from Abu Dhabi and the best from </v>
<v Speaker 3>metamorris and try to combine it </v>

1906
01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:34.260
<v Speaker 3>metamorris submission only one match out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

1907
01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:39.650
<v Speaker 3>And Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the super 16 man brackets that are in </v>

1908
01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:40.350
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch it one by one,</v>

1909
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:43.630
<v Speaker 3>one at a time center stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mindblowing.</v>

1910
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 3>When you watch it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to watch it like that.</v>

1911
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.380
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what made Ebi Ebi too,</v>

1912
01:21:49.381 --> 01:21:52.770
<v Speaker 3>which I mean Gary went and submitted </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody in that 16 man bracket.</v>

1913
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Every dude he ran through and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>final,</v>

1914
01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.930
<v Speaker 3>by the time we got to the final with him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Richie,</v>

1915
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Richie blew through everybody on his end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the bracket,</v>

1916
01:22:00.391 --> 01:22:01.990
<v Speaker 3>so it was Richie and Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

1917
01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was going nuts because they saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>it unfold one at a time.</v>

1918
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1919
01:22:07.501 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1920
01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:11.550
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to do that with glory and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am actually.</v>

1921
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:16.551
<v Speaker 3>I've been advising people against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a terrible idea for </v>

1922
01:22:16.551 --> 01:22:17.690
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing and too much data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much damage.</v>

1923
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.970
<v Speaker 3>People going to get hurt for cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to want to get Kayo.</v>

1924
01:22:20.971 --> 01:22:25.971
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem you get sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get killed and you still fighting when </v>

1925
01:22:25.971 --> 01:22:29.960
<v Speaker 3>you know you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get knocked out and you're still </v>

1926
01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:29.960
<v Speaker 3>fighting on autopilot and then it's over</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what happened?</v>

1927
01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.250
<v Speaker 3>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a decision like what I've seen </v>

1928
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.250
<v Speaker 3>that happen with guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not say Gloria,</v>

1929
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:38.961
<v Speaker 3>they fought three times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had the last man standing </v>

1930
01:22:38.961 --> 01:22:38.961
<v Speaker 3>tournament in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to that right.</v>

1931
01:22:38.961 --> 01:22:39.390
<v Speaker 3>You can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that should.</v>

1932
01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:44.450
<v Speaker 3>They fought three fucking times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man box and the first fight Joe </v>

1933
01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Schilling had to fight for rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the third after the third round </v>

1934
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:51.420
<v Speaker 3>was a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how powerful tournament's on when</v>

1935
01:22:51.421 --> 01:22:56.421
<v Speaker 3>you watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so powerful that you might not be </v>

1936
01:22:56.421 --> 01:22:56.670
<v Speaker 3>able to do on kickboxing is all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit could go wrong.</v>

1937
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.170
<v Speaker 3>It's root,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's risky,</v>

1938
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:03.290
<v Speaker 3>but the tournament is so exciting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could pull this off and no one </v>

1939
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:07.311
<v Speaker 3>gets hurt and we get lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a grand show that people are going </v>

1940
01:23:07.311 --> 01:23:08.530
<v Speaker 3>to watch over and and when you watch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning to end,</v>

1941
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 3>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a documentary.</v>

1942
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:15.150
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good point and I think if </v>

1943
01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:18.390
<v Speaker 3>someone got ahold of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who produces sports television </v>

1944
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>and realize that this is like an unsung </v>
<v Speaker 3>property like this is out there.</v>

1945
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:22.570
<v Speaker 3>The sport is at a very high level right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1946
01:23:22.571 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Guys are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very exciting and no one has capitalized</v>

1947
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:30.241
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's put it on television and no </v>

1948
01:23:30.241 --> 01:23:30.241
<v Speaker 3>one's making money with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just don't know.</v>

1949
01:23:30.241 --> 01:23:30.880
<v Speaker 3>They just don't know how to do it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1950
01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:34.060
<v Speaker 3>you got to get rid of the points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know I put together Ebi,</v>

1951
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:37.270
<v Speaker 3>like if some old Jewish guy who owned </v>
<v Speaker 3>some network said,</v>

1952
01:23:37.271 --> 01:23:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about this martial art </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1953
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:41.020
<v Speaker 3>but I like your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you one season.</v>

1954
01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about no Jujitsu or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1955
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you one season.</v>

1956
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.480
<v Speaker 3>As soon as the ratings drop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's out.</v>

1957
01:23:46.481 --> 01:23:48.250
<v Speaker 3>We got a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you would go,</v>

1958
01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1959
01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:50.990
<v Speaker 3>We got to get rid of the fucking game we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

1960
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:54.850
<v Speaker 3>We got to get rid of the points and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to have a tournament.</v>

1961
01:23:55.090 --> 01:24:00.090
<v Speaker 3>You've got to see it unfold because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what makes the ultimate fighter </v>

1962
01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:00.640
<v Speaker 3>so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's at the tournament,</v>

1963
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.950
<v Speaker 3>although it doesn't happen in one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still a tournament.</v>

1964
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.490
<v Speaker 3>You see the brackets unfolding just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the march madness.</v>

1965
01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:11.491
<v Speaker 3>I hate basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I understand why there's </v>

1966
01:24:11.491 --> 01:24:11.580
<v Speaker 3>tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it all unfolding.</v>

1967
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:13.190
<v Speaker 3>You see the drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1968
01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is what's missing from </v>

1969
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:18.200
<v Speaker 3>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

1970
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.780
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you can't get it on tv </v>

1971
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 3>because in all the other formats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just too much stalling,</v>

1972
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:26.470
<v Speaker 3>too much holding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need right now to dispute your claims</v>

1973
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.480
<v Speaker 3>because right now you're talking crazy.</v>

1974
01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so about biggie.</v>

1975
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.170
<v Speaker 3>There is no live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let no let go.</v>

1976
01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of his quotes.</v>

1977
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing funnier than Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinterpretations of English.</v>

1978
01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I said Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture of a tee shirt that I've found</v>

1979
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>in my closet way back in the day of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Waleed Ish.</v>

1980
01:24:52.271 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 3>My leg t shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:59.030
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did it say on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said on the back there's a cartoon </v>

1982
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Him being always on me and he's like,</v>

1983
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.370
<v Speaker 3>he's actually the nicest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweetest guy in the sky.</v>

1984
01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 3>All those mean looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all him doing pro wrestling.</v>

1985
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:08.050
<v Speaker 3>He's actually super sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Nice.</v>

1986
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 3>He'll take a picture and then he'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little kid.</v>

1987
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:15.360
<v Speaker 3>He'll look at his picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A classic one back in late,</v>

1988
01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:16.730
<v Speaker 3>2004,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2003.</v>

1989
01:25:16.731 --> 01:25:21.731
<v Speaker 3>I love that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a shirt where it's him standing </v>

1990
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:25.990
<v Speaker 3>there like in a cartoon character and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>says on the top,</v>

1991
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.910
<v Speaker 3>don't be coward.</v>

1992
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.570
<v Speaker 3>Don't run from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't run off the fight.</v>

1993
01:25:31.571 --> 01:25:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be coward.</v>

1994
01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Don't run off the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>

1995
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Imagine what a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he turned in,</v>

1996
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 3>like when he went to the t shirt shop </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

1997
01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:45.900
<v Speaker 3>there's an American guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1998
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:47.900
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it now.</v>

1999
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Now I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this right now.</v>

2001
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Initial right there and right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We'll call it that.</v>

2007

2009
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 2>it on himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get this out of the way.</v>

2010
01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Now you Mr.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and this is exactly how you would like </v>

2012
01:26:26.261 --> 01:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>print it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes to court.</v>

2013
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:31.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To do a selfie video that I'm trying to </v>

2014
01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:33.740
<v Speaker 2>find the picture I know and claims that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up.</v>

2015
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not the true Jujitsu.</v>

2016
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I never say run off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run off the stupid.</v>

2017
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:26:44.001 --> 01:26:49.001
<v Speaker 2>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a crazy match with him and </v>

2019
01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:49.001
<v Speaker 2>hoists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that shit on the beach in Rio.</v>

2020
01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:51.380
<v Speaker 2>They fought like with Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so were laid out in the sand.</v>

2021
01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Everybody got sand in their eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their face.</v>

2022
01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:59.230
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking sand everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They slapped him some mats down on the </v>

2023
01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:02.261
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She always had big balls to take that </v>

2024
01:27:02.261 --> 01:27:04.560
<v Speaker 2>because while lead was fucking everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>up back then and while lead he got him </v>

2025
01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 2>in a clock choke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them to sleep.</v>

2026
01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.340
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing to watch too.</v>

2027
01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe they let him take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bike.</v>

2028
01:27:09.111 --> 01:27:14.111
<v Speaker 2>Is Jen the general consensus in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>late like after the UFC around like how </v>

2029
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:20.890
<v Speaker 2>good is hoist Jujitsu for real and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was never like a world champion or a </v>

2030
01:27:21.591 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 2>national champion or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew that.</v>

2031
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knew his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had decent Jujitsu.</v>

2032
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.120
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't lighting the world on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him to take a vow that volleyball</v>

2033
01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.360
<v Speaker 2>match man that showed he had gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls because volleyed was a destroyer.</v>

2034
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hugely ballsy move.</v>

2035
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:39.770
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got choked asleep,</v>

2036
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:43.970
<v Speaker 2>which I think was very important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu just to show like you.</v>

2037
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Everyone looked at hoists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gracie,</v>

2038
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:48.140
<v Speaker 2>rightly so as this massive innovator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2039
01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.160
<v Speaker 2>this pioneer of Jujitsu and mma I heroes</v>
<v Speaker 2>was after the UFC gets choked out.</v>

2040
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:57.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a hero of Jujitsu and then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2042
01:27:57.441 --> 01:28:02.441
<v Speaker 2>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys out there that are another </v>

2043
01:28:02.441 --> 01:28:02.441
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another level above him,</v>

2044
01:28:02.441 --> 01:28:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of them.</v>

2045
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what he said about Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2046
01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:09.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not actually that good Hickson's 10 </v>

2047
01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:09.851
<v Speaker 2>times better than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Japanese went,</v>

2048
01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:09.851
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2049
01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:10.540
<v Speaker 2>You sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2050
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you have his number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that it's not a cartoon cartoon.</v>

2051
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a picture of him.</v>

2052
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had more than one eddie.</v>

2053
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.950
<v Speaker 2>There was more than one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2054
01:28:21.951 --> 01:28:22.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2055
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:24.220
<v Speaker 2>This is the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The back.</v>

2056
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.630
<v Speaker 2>You need the back of the bag of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

2057
01:28:26.631 --> 01:28:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

2058
01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 2>No mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no rules,</v>

2059
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:33.560
<v Speaker 2>no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a different one then man.</v>

2060
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 2>This is the one that things don't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2061
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I have the same shirt on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

2062
01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I haven't him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in.</v>

2063
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:42.920
<v Speaker 2>He's in cartoon form two and the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All yoked and shit.</v>

2064
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:45.620
<v Speaker 2>There was definitely more than one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those ridiculous shirts though,</v>

2065
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:49.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's why a those is so funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

2066
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:54.870
<v Speaker 2>if you think that he's actually being </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative and not those kind of </v>

2067
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:55.640
<v Speaker 2>conservative with his language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>

2068
01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.350
<v Speaker 2>he's not a stick man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a real motherfucker schick shtick</v>

2069
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:04.960
<v Speaker 1>as the stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say no,</v>

2070
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2071
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like his act out a lot.</v>

2072
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He's actually that cocky in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think amazing.</v>

2073
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:16.220
<v Speaker 1>It's super confident guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2074
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:21.230
<v Speaker 1>he really is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you be willing to match him with </v>

2075
01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:21.230
<v Speaker 1>the game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the game is his strong suit.</v>

2076
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never said anything bad about him and </v>

2077
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.510
<v Speaker 1>he's always been nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

2078
01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 1>No comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's scared the videos when Nate Diaz is</v>

2079
01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:33.170
<v Speaker 1>taking it serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2080
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2081
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I met him it was a joke </v>

2082
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:40.560
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a joke.</v>

2083
01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.210
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really that arrogant.</v>

2084
01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.510
<v Speaker 1>It everyone thinks he's just pretending </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be arrogant.</v>

2085
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:45.900
<v Speaker 1>He was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was doing.</v>

2086
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm showing my respect because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>passport has specked.</v>

2087
01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that someone was thinking about</v>

2088
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:57.690
<v Speaker 1>trying to turn submission grappling into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a television show,</v>

2089
01:29:57.691 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Speaker 1>like who's trying to do it?</v>

2090
01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2091
01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying that people were </v>

2092
01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.051
<v Speaker 1>trying to be trying to be like the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way that you were talking about </v>

2093
01:30:06.051 --> 01:30:07.290
<v Speaker 1>how somebody be fighting in Beltour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2094
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to be in UFC?</v>

2095
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>People are trying to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2096
01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I've had multiple organizations now </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me to be exclusive to their </v>

2097
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:18.130
<v Speaker 1>organization for competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2098
01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much.</v>

2099
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:23.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds terrible.</v>

2100
01:30:23.281 --> 01:30:27.450
<v Speaker 1>If they pay enough cash or enough money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>

2101
01:30:27.451 --> 01:30:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2102
01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in favor of.</v>

2103
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big issue with with the MMA is in </v>

2104
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 1>the big issue with boxing has always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been that trying to get the best guys to</v>

2105
01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:39.570
<v Speaker 1>be able to fight the best guys when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exclusive for one promoter,</v>

2106
01:30:39.571 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 1>exclusive for another promoter and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes things super problematic.</v>

2107
01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Independent contracts for independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>matches and no longterm commitment to </v>

2108
01:30:48.121 --> 01:30:53.121
<v Speaker 1>things is the smart way to go for </v>
<v Speaker 1>grapplers because if that gets </v>

2109
01:30:53.121 --> 01:30:56.601
<v Speaker 1>established as the Goto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it favors the grappa and then </v>

2110
01:30:56.601 --> 01:30:57.780
<v Speaker 1>there's no advantage that the promoter </v>
<v Speaker 1>has over the grappa.</v>

2111
01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.790
<v Speaker 1>The grappa could always find another </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoter,</v>

2112
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:00.990
<v Speaker 1>so if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the.</v>

2113
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:06.050
<v Speaker 1>If the promoters get along with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grapplers and everybody agrees with how </v>

2114
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 1>much money everybody's making and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems cool and fair,</v>

2115
01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.050
<v Speaker 1>then that would be a good way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2116
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.170
<v Speaker 1>so no one has a lockdown on the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very important.</v>

2117
01:31:13.171 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to adjust me to turn down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the offer.</v>

2118
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2119
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you,</v>

2120
01:31:17.551 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

2121
01:31:18.421 --> 01:31:21.610
<v Speaker 1>That takes balls and that's a smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do because I think if,</v>

2122
01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's just set that precedent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we created this market where the </v>

2123
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:29.400
<v Speaker 1>grapplers where the star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is what's important.</v>

2124
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:31.200
<v Speaker 1>If people want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2125
01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.400
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcella Garcia versus Gary tone of </v>

2126
01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.620
<v Speaker 1>people want to see that match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real benefit is of that match.</v>

2127
01:31:37.621 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>The benefactors of that mass should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcella Garcia and Gary Tonin.</v>

2128
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And then of course some money should go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the promoter.</v>

2129
01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some money should,</v>

2130
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:49.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's what's the only thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting about submission grappling is </v>

2131
01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the submission grapplers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2132
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not selling that,</v>

2133
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you're selling air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2134
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.590
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you got.</v>

2135
01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So if you're locked up to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

2136
01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.380
<v Speaker 1>it's also limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matches,</v>

2137
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:05.400
<v Speaker 5>matches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't make it can only do a certain </v>

2138
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:05.570
<v Speaker 5>number of matches per year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2139
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.620
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what organization puts on 12 matches a </v>

2140
01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.860
<v Speaker 5>year right now is the same guy every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every match.</v>

2141
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.890
<v Speaker 5>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that the promoter,</v>

2142
01:32:14.891 --> 01:32:16.390
<v Speaker 5>whoever's doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>

2143
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:18.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure he's probably saying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>

2144
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we want to be as big as the UFC,</v>

2145
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 5>UFC type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly,</v>

2146
01:32:23.351 --> 01:32:28.351
<v Speaker 5>and it's just such a flawed mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like for the sport doesn't have </v>

2147
01:32:28.351 --> 01:32:31.360
<v Speaker 5>to be so young and it's so tiny and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's very little money.</v>

2148
01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Every single one of these organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these professional organizations,</v>

2149
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Ebi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Metamorris,</v>

2150
01:32:35.681 --> 01:32:40.681
<v Speaker 5>Polaris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these things that are popping up </v>

2151
01:32:40.681 --> 01:32:40.681
<v Speaker 5>here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all doing amazing things for the</v>

2152
01:32:40.681 --> 01:32:45.451
<v Speaker 5>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're broadening the audience for </v>

2153
01:32:45.451 --> 01:32:47.221
<v Speaker 5>submission grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so silly to think that you need to </v>

2154
01:32:47.221 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 5>be just the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody is cross promoting each other.</v>

2155
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.950
<v Speaker 5>I like when my guys fight Metamorris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2156

2166
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:25.090
<v Speaker 5>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

2167
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:25.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are doing Jujitsu,</v>

2168
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:28.270
<v Speaker 5>the people that are involved in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're involved in these matches,</v>

2169
01:33:28.271 --> 01:33:33.271
<v Speaker 5>if you're involved in competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely 99 percent of the time </v>

2170
01:33:33.271 --> 01:33:34.180
<v Speaker 5>you're making your money off of </v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching.</v>

2171
01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:39.540
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of the people that are running </v>

2172
01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:39.540
<v Speaker 5>these schools,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where they're making their money,</v>

2173
01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.511
<v Speaker 5>so it's not like a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this giant piece of pie that </v>

2174
01:33:42.511 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 5>everybody's battling over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so everybody wants dominance.</v>

2175
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:48.930
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's beneficial for you to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>your students into metamorris because </v>

2176
01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:50.380
<v Speaker 5>then they could highlight how good of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>teacher you are.</v>

2177
01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.730
<v Speaker 5>Good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

2178
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:57.040
<v Speaker 5>It's good for Metamorris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good for Ebi when he comes back,</v>

2179
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 5>because will never be exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always going to be an Abi.</v>

2180
01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2181
01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:04.600
<v Speaker 5>And so why would I want to keep them </v>
<v Speaker 5>from metamorris and back and forth?</v>

2182
01:34:04.601 --> 01:34:05.540
<v Speaker 5>I'd tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd tell her,</v>

2183
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:07.510
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's let's work together and use.</v>

2184
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:12.580
<v Speaker 5>Let's let me blow up the guys and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>ship them off to you.</v>

2185
01:34:12.581 --> 01:34:14.860
<v Speaker 5>I love Metamora,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he makes the most money that way.</v>

2186
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:16.800
<v Speaker 5>And then we come back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2187
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 5>we bring them back over to Ebi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is the new way of thinking.</v>

2188
01:34:20.141 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 5>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of exists in everything exists</v>

2189
01:34:23.471 --> 01:34:28.471
<v Speaker 5>in martial arts were martial arts today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like here's a perfect example of </v>

2190
01:34:28.471 --> 01:34:28.471
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

2191
01:34:28.471 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 5>Guys are constantly trading techniques </v>
<v Speaker 5>to each other,</v>

2192
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.160
<v Speaker 5>constantly showing each other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing about martial arts in </v>

2193
01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:35.590
<v Speaker 5>the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in the sixties,</v>

2194
01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:37.330
<v Speaker 5>in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was how secret it was.</v>

2195
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:40.780
<v Speaker 5>They had secret techniques and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>would hide from you the seeing.</v>

2196
01:34:40.781 --> 01:34:45.781
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't teach white people member </v>
<v Speaker 5>brutally got in trouble for teaching </v>

2197
01:34:45.781 --> 01:34:46.810
<v Speaker 5>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing with Mexicans.</v>

2198
01:34:46.811 --> 01:34:49.740
<v Speaker 5>Either you couldn't teach western,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't teach Americans you,</v>

2199
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:54.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to keep it within the </v>

2200
01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:54.810
<v Speaker 5>Chinese culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's the total opposite.</v>

2201
01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:58.920
<v Speaker 5>Now everybody's exchanging and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's just trying to find out </v>

2202
01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:58.920
<v Speaker 5>what's the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's the best at this?</v>

2203
01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And you get guys together and you match </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up with each other.</v>

2204
01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:05.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially the new thinking and </v>

2205
01:35:05.261 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 1>new thinking for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this is how it is </v>

2206
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:11.861
<v Speaker 1>right now so far with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with professional submission grappling </v>

2207
01:35:11.861 --> 01:35:13.040
<v Speaker 1>is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means it has a shot.</v>

2208
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:18.250
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as someone comes along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>buys the whole thing and then wants to </v>

2209
01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:18.250
<v Speaker 1>put on only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

2210
01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:21.380
<v Speaker 1>12 matches a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you compete,</v>

2211
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:23.930
<v Speaker 1>how often do you compete in as once or </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

2212
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Once to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twice a month.</v>

2213
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2214
01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:28.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>

2215
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not just training all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're throwing yourself into battle all</v>

2216
01:35:32.331 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2217
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I've seen quite a few of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your matches online and I saw the recent</v>

2218
01:35:36.951 --> 01:35:37.570

2223
01:35:45.021 --> 01:35:50.021

<v Speaker 1>He was probably one of the most game </v>

<v Speaker 1>people that showed up to that show.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we get back out to the feet and then </v>

2404
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:27.301
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I drilled this with my wrestling coach </v>

2405
01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:27.301
<v Speaker 6>for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2406
01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:27.301
<v Speaker 6>we do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's still drilling.</v>

2407
01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:30.820
<v Speaker 6>I'm just establishing the under hook </v>
<v Speaker 6>from collar ties and hitting a good snap</v>

2408
01:43:30.821 --> 01:43:34.990
<v Speaker 6>down from here to get a good snap down </v>
<v Speaker 6>and get control of the head now and then</v>

2409
01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:37.570
<v Speaker 6>I just follow it and now my hands aren't</v>
<v Speaker 6>connected yet.</v>

2410
01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:43.140
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I'm trying to connect my hands </v>

2411
01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.350
<v Speaker 6>finally get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And once the hands get connected he </v>

2412
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:47.500
<v Speaker 6>tries to struggle out a couple more </v>
<v Speaker 6>times and finally sinks in deep.</v>

2413
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:50.890
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe we can't see this j </v>
<v Speaker 6>we've got to deal with that today.</v>

2414
01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:51.200
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2415
01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:57.940

<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Or.</v>

<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

01:44:14.490 --> 01:44:16.410
<v Speaker 3>what's happening Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

2424
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:19.320
<v Speaker 3>There it goes and he already tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

2425
01:44:19.321 --> 01:44:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back it up a little bit then.</v>

2426
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.960
<v Speaker 3>So this is the part where you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands connected.</v>

2427
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it does have your arm.</v>

2428
01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:30.240
<v Speaker 3>He ducked hard so that my hands were </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated and then I connect him.</v>

2429
01:44:30.241 --> 01:44:33.390
<v Speaker 3>Finally get that crunching on the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you got it from half guard here.</v>

2430
01:44:33.391 --> 01:44:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are Men or Marcella team?</v>

2432
01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:41.520

<v Speaker 3>it's high elbow Gulati and you catch </v>

2433
01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:41.520
<v Speaker 3>this from half guard all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2434
01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:41.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2435
01:44:41.821 --> 01:44:46.821
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't set it up from half guard </v>
<v Speaker 3>but I ended up in half guard for the </v>

2436
01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:47.190
<v Speaker 3>finish for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we come up a little bit.</v>

2437
01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:49.110
<v Speaker 3>We reset it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2438
01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a full mouth Marcella,</v>

2439
01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.300
<v Speaker 3>or you guys call it high elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High Elbow.</v>

2440
01:44:54.301 --> 01:44:54.730
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2441
01:44:54.731 --> 01:44:54.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2442
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:55.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcella uses it.</v>

2443
01:44:55.921 --> 01:44:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2444
01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:59.100
<v Speaker 3>finished in full garb with his arm </v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped.</v>

2445
01:44:59.130 --> 01:45:01.200
<v Speaker 3>His arm was trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His was his left arm trapped.</v>

2446
01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see.</v>

2447
01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to watch it again.</v>

2448
01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I intentionally trapped </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2449
01:45:05.761 --> 01:45:08.460
<v Speaker 3>but damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guillotine right there,</v>

2450
01:45:08.461 --> 01:45:12.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was huge one seeing Marcello hit it</v>

2451
01:45:12.661 --> 01:45:17.661
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason I called it Marcella </v>

2452
01:45:17.661 --> 01:45:19.671
<v Speaker 3>teen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it was called high high </v>

2453
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:19.671
<v Speaker 3>elbow Gilot time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2454
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:22.131
<v Speaker 3>That was a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just stuck with Marcella teen so </v>

2455
01:45:22.131 --> 01:45:23.340
<v Speaker 3>that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 10th planet system,</v>

2456
01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.860
<v Speaker 3>every time that comes up and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>crucial,</v>

2457
01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:30.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of our warm ups that I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marcello to make sure he gets credit </v>

2458
01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:34.971
<v Speaker 3>because sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's had more success with it than </v>

2459
01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:34.971
<v Speaker 3>anybody I would say because of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

2460
01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 3>He's probably the best at it.</v>

2461
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:38.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him run through black belts.</v>

2462
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen her run through a high level </v>

2463
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.270
<v Speaker 3>black belt 10 times in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the same?</v>

2464
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:45.120
<v Speaker 3>The same guillotine technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2465
01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:50.180
<v Speaker 3>John was preaching to me to get good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that technique for so long and like I </v>

2466
01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.320
<v Speaker 3>sucked at it for forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time.</v>

2467
01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.200
<v Speaker 3>How will you connecting your hands?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2468
01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I just grab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I grabbed like mid,</v>

2469
01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.400
<v Speaker 3>mid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I go down past the pinky </v>

2470
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.630
<v Speaker 3>inbetween the risks and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the pinky bone and then grabbed my </v>

2471
01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:04.630
<v Speaker 3>left hand over the right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab my hand.</v>

2472
01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I know I've hit some on the left side </v>
<v Speaker 3>and competition.</v>

2473
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:07.290
<v Speaker 3>I've gone the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2474
01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:09.510
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like if I'm finishing on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right side.</v>

2475
01:46:09.511 --> 01:46:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Left hand over.</v>

2476
01:46:10.231 --> 01:46:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen people hit it,</v>

2477
01:46:11.970 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 3>hit it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people do it with 10 finger </v>

2478
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 3>grips.</v>

2479
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2480
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:21.050
<v Speaker 3>The difference between those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Marcella told me is this feels so </v>

2481
01:46:21.181 --> 01:46:24.450
<v Speaker 3>much easier for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what Marcella says,</v>

2482
01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.040
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Danny does it this way too,</v>

2483
01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:28.470
<v Speaker 3>but marcel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went over it.</v>

2484
01:46:28.471 --> 01:46:33.471
<v Speaker 3>He said he doesn't like this as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this because the guard underneath is </v>

2485
01:46:33.601 --> 01:46:38.601
<v Speaker 3>going to come up and reach and grab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he gets in between these two </v>

2486
01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:39.930
<v Speaker 3>hands here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his fingers are going to come up,</v>

2487
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:41.970
<v Speaker 3>he can wreck the grip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be the grip.</v>

2488
01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.250
<v Speaker 3>But if he comes up here and I come this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2489
01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.830
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter if he grabs the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>

2490
01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.390
<v Speaker 3>That's how most people think they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing right thing.</v>

2491
01:46:49.391 --> 01:46:49.700
<v Speaker 3>They're gone</v>

2492
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:55.130
<v Speaker 1>and I still get choked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna still get choked because </v>

2493
01:46:55.130 --> 01:46:57.000
<v Speaker 1>he's coming around it instead of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense.</v>

2494
01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.670
<v Speaker 1>It makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different.</v>

2495
01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:02.250
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about people don't know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to,</v>

2496
01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:07.251
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different ways to </v>

2497
01:47:07.251 --> 01:47:07.251
<v Speaker 1>hold your hands with different </v>
<v Speaker 1>submissions.</v>

2498
01:47:07.251 --> 01:47:11.541
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Jujitsu is that there's little </v>

2499
01:47:11.541 --> 01:47:12.060
<v Speaker 1>tweaks that you'll learn a little turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and twists.</v>

2500
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Like Einstein always likes to call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom rock.</v>

2501
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.720
<v Speaker 1>You know that one team where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2502
01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen that commercial for </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom rock.</v>

2503
01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A commercial for one of those </v>

2504
01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.790
<v Speaker 1>compilation records that you would buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you turn it up,</v>

2505
01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:28.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the turning it up,</v>

2506
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:31.410
<v Speaker 1>freedom rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the turning your,</v>

2507
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:36.411
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand to the side and forcing the </v>

2508
01:47:36.411 --> 01:47:36.411
<v Speaker 1>blade of your wrist.</v>

2509
01:47:36.411 --> 01:47:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And this one's named,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he named me basically named the squeeze </v>

2510
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:43.671
<v Speaker 1>of the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a name for what you're </v>

2511
01:47:43.671 --> 01:47:43.671
<v Speaker 1>technically doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2512
01:47:43.671 --> 01:47:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he named it and it's a good name.</v>

2513
01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's freedom rock.</v>

2514
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Just to remind you that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just figure four on your arms,</v>

2515
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you got to turn it in and squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a smart thing.</v>

2516
01:47:54.150 --> 01:47:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It is a smart thing and it's cool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's those little technical things </v>

2517
01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:02.541
<v Speaker 1>about Jujitsu and for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that get involved in it and </v>

2518
01:48:02.541 --> 01:48:06.591
<v Speaker 1>start realizing like from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at one way and then you get </v>

2519
01:48:06.591 --> 01:48:06.591
<v Speaker 1>involved in it and you start seeing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the depth to it.</v>

2520
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:10.120
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the Jujitsu nerds come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into place because that's what it does.</v>

2521
01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to jive like people </v>

2522
01:48:15.150 --> 01:48:17.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how come these really computer </v>

2523
01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:19.071
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nerdy kind of dudes are so in love with </v>

2524
01:48:19.071 --> 01:48:19.071
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu?</v>

2525
01:48:19.071 --> 01:48:19.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2526
01:48:19.071 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 1>like Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her always talks about there's a video </v>

2527
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:24.360
<v Speaker 1>that we were talking about earlier that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they playing on the underground with him</v>

2528
01:48:24.361 --> 01:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>talking about it being high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

2529
01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:31.340
<v Speaker 1>problem solving under stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's exciting about people </v>

2530
01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.061
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they would be into video games or </v>

2531
01:48:35.061 --> 01:48:38.661
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'd be into chats or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be into all sorts of problem </v>

2532
01:48:38.661 --> 01:48:39.870
<v Speaker 1>solving type things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get doing it in real time.</v>

2533
01:48:39.871 --> 01:48:44.130
<v Speaker 1>The rush of success is so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the rush of winning a chess match,</v>

2534
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:49.131
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think it is good as you </v>

2535
01:48:49.131 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 1>choking kit dale out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>

2536
01:48:49.921 --> 01:48:51.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even possible.</v>

2537
01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rush is the ultimate rush.</v>

2538
01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead rush.</v>

2539
01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:00.740
<v Speaker 1>This is not a like a Bang Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dead in a virtual sense when </v>

2540
01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you're wake character.</v>

2541
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:05.040
<v Speaker 1>This is like you're playing death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody overlaid some of your podcasts,</v>

2542
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:06.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over some like Jujitsu video,</v>

2543
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:12.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real about you talking about </v>

2544
01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:12.020
<v Speaker 1>submissions and like what submissions </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are,</v>

2545
01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:12.600
<v Speaker 1>what a tap really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

2546
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:17.660
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I just possibly killed you right </v>

2547
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:17.660
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:17.660
<v Speaker 1>You're killing dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You killed.</v>

2549
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Killed Kennedy mean perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

2550
01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's also beautiful for people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing it that you could kill a guy </v>

2551
01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:25.650
<v Speaker 1>like that and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fine afterwards.</v>

2552
01:49:26.170 --> 01:49:28.110
<v Speaker 1>You're holding his hand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fine.</v>

2553
01:49:28.111 --> 01:49:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Means neck was sore the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that he's fine.</v>

2554
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:34.230
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get beat up.</v>

2555
01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:38.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like a more ethical form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of combat entertainment.</v>

2556
01:49:38.191 --> 01:49:41.700
<v Speaker 1>If somebody was going to put it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody decided to put the Ebi on spike</v>

2557
01:49:41.701 --> 01:49:43.620
<v Speaker 1>tv or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2558
01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a problem with,</v>

2559
01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:46.050
<v Speaker 1>with head trauma.</v>

2560
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Like that fucking kid that just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A boxer just died the other day of </v>

2561
01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:54.770
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen no matter what if </v>

2562
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you have combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Jujitsu it's way,</v>

2563
01:49:55.391 --> 01:49:56.380
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2564
01:49:56.381 --> 01:49:57.520
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2565
01:49:57.521 --> 01:49:58.990
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way safer.</v>

2566
01:49:59.010 --> 01:50:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely safe for longterm for the </v>

2567
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:05.881
<v Speaker 1>participants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could still like you watched </v>

2568
01:50:05.881 --> 01:50:05.881
<v Speaker 1>that match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2569
01:50:05.881 --> 01:50:06.220
<v Speaker 1>that's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2570
01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I dare anybody who knows nothing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

2571
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:14.700
<v Speaker 1>just watch Gary Thompson versus Kit Dale</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch it with an open mind and watch</v>

2572
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 1>those transitions that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and you realize like,</v>

2573
01:50:16.931 --> 01:50:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a.</v>

2574
01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.630
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a crazy thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2575
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:24.870
<v Speaker 1>they're like Helson Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had Steve Maxwell and the podcast the </v>

2576
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:29.671
<v Speaker 1>other day and Helson Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked him to describe Jujitsu </v>

2577
01:50:29.671 --> 01:50:33.151
<v Speaker 1>and I guess his English is not the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and he's got a little bit </v>

2578
01:50:33.151 --> 01:50:33.151
<v Speaker 1>of an accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2579
01:50:33.151 --> 01:50:33.250
<v Speaker 1>this is Jujutsu.</v>

2580
01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I do that.</v>

2581
01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Then you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I do that forever.</v>

2582
01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the dopest fucking answer me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is kind of what it is in a way </v>

2583
01:50:45.090 --> 01:50:49.861
<v Speaker 1>until one of us almost dies or keep it </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you can't keep it up anymore,</v>

2584
01:50:51.971 --> 01:50:56.971
<v Speaker 1>and then that guy beats you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The super hyper way of killing someone </v>

2585
01:50:56.971 --> 01:50:57.250
<v Speaker 1>and breaking their limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John dammit her.</v>

2586
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Remember we hung out with them that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>night he said,</v>

2587
01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:01.420
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it,</v>

2588
01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.920
<v Speaker 1>a striking is the least intelligent way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking someone out,</v>

2589
01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.370
<v Speaker 1>grappling that's the most intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2590
01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Striking is the most caveman way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

2591
01:51:11.981 --> 01:51:16.981
<v Speaker 1>just keep hitting each other's heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over until someone goes down </v>

2592
01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:22.380
<v Speaker 1>when grappling is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take this guy down and </v>

2593
01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.871
<v Speaker 1>scientifically put them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them to sleep and get the hell out </v>

2594
01:51:24.871 --> 01:51:27.521
<v Speaker 1>of that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a situation where you can't </v>

2595
01:51:27.521 --> 01:51:29.740
<v Speaker 1>grapple with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in a street fight,</v>

2596
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:34.860
<v Speaker 1>would you want to be in a street fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Marcella Garcia in a bar or would </v>

2597
01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you want to be in the street fight with </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne.</v>

2598
01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:40.560
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne Park is going to be head kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and motherfuckers and putting people in </v>

2599
01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.801
<v Speaker 1>the hospital with elbows to the face </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you tried to get close to that </v>

2600
01:51:43.801 --> 01:51:46.951
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get your head smashed </v>

2601
01:51:46.951 --> 01:51:46.951
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John always talks about striking eyes,</v>

2602
01:51:46.951 --> 01:51:50.841
<v Speaker 1>like inability to do crazy amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage in such a short period of time.</v>

2603
01:51:51.221 --> 01:51:54.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's clearly pluses and minuses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in real life situations.</v>

2604
01:51:55.090 --> 01:52:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to just go to the ground </v>

2605
01:52:00.090 --> 01:52:00.090
<v Speaker 1>striking skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was a kickboxer.</v>

2606
01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice to be able to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence to throw,</v>

2607
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:05.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take three dudes out if you're</v>

2608
01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:08.920
<v Speaker 1>striking move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you time it perfectly,</v>

2609
01:52:08.921 --> 01:52:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you can take three dudes out for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't know and they fuck with Melvin</v>

2610
01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:15.560
<v Speaker 1>manhoef in a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First guys asleep dead.</v>

2611
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:18.310
<v Speaker 1>There's two guys left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy runs says fuck that,</v>

2612
01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.020
<v Speaker 1>and then it's one on one and that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

2613
01:52:20.021 --> 01:52:21.010
<v Speaker 1>He's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dead.</v>

2614
01:52:21.190 --> 01:52:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Badr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hari Badr,</v>

2615
01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Hari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they,</v>

2616
01:52:23.710 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why he was from jail </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than once,</v>

2617
01:52:26.231 --> 01:52:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I think beating the fuck out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why he's in jail.</v>

2618
01:52:29.650 --> 01:52:34.650
<v Speaker 1>They took this guy's leg and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomped it and snapped his Shin in half </v>

2619
01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:38.890
<v Speaker 1>and this guy is fucked the wrong dude to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck with,</v>

2620
01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:39.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

2621
01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:42.880
<v Speaker 1>in a street confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see both sides.</v>

2622
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:44.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2623
01:52:44.081 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it's good to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get like super</v>

2624
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:48.680
<v Speaker 2>high level and striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is intelligent.</v>

2625
01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:51.020
<v Speaker 2>It's more intelligent than wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with somebody.</v>

2626
01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:56.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a bar and a bunch of other </v>

2627
01:52:56.021 --> 01:52:56.021
<v Speaker 2>people around and you're in a melee type</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

2628
01:52:56.021 --> 01:52:57.730
<v Speaker 2>if you can be a John Donner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

2629
01:52:57.850 --> 01:52:58.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2630
01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.350
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could protect yourself for sure.</v>

2631
01:53:00.370 --> 01:53:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John is an excellent blackbelt.</v>

2632
01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that goes one on one with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just going to get mangled.</v>

2633
01:53:05.811 --> 01:53:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Some untrained person doesn't know any </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

2634
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:14.080
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be willing to bet that even </v>

2635
01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.301
<v Speaker 2>multiple people that have tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack John had some trouble as a </v>

2636
01:53:16.301 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 2>bouncer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely many years of his life.</v>

2637
01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:19.130
<v Speaker 2>He's had to deal with a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he would use you as a shield.</v>

2638
01:53:19.330 --> 01:53:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start using your arms to beat other </v>

2639
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:25.430
<v Speaker 2>people senseless with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point being is not unintelligent</v>

2640
01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.610
<v Speaker 2>to have a John Wayne par skillset and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2641
01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:32.740
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely an intelligent way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use striking obviously Badr Hari or hey,</v>

2642
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just throwing her under the bus.</v>

2643
01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Why do you feel like we're doing all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and just completely misconstruing </v>

2644
01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:46.670
<v Speaker 2>everything he's ever said to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ruining all of it.</v>

2645
01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.210
<v Speaker 2>There's no either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>

2646
01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a lot of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of technique to high </v>

2647
01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:56.561
<v Speaker 2>level striking if you watch like those </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lawrence Kenshin breakdowns or the Jack </v>

2648
01:53:56.561 --> 01:53:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Slack breakdowns on the under </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground.</v>

2649
01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 2>He goes over like the real technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of why like bluecat or you know,</v>

2650
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 2>a yachtsman Cli on the really high level</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thai guys.</v>

2651
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Why they're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit going on.</v>

2652
01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It just looks like they're smashing each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other with their bones.</v>

2653
01:54:10.221 --> 01:54:15.221
<v Speaker 2>But nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How one guy keeps getting smashed and </v>

2654
01:54:15.221 --> 01:54:15.490
<v Speaker 2>the other guy does all the smashing like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2655
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know guys that are dummies,</v>

2656
01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:21.290
<v Speaker 2>shit and amazing Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2657
01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know some really super strong and the </v>

2658
01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:32.210
<v Speaker 2>same either currently.</v>

2659
01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2660
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited about Jujitsu right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's like one of the best </v>

2661
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.270
<v Speaker 2>times for whatever because of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2662
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:42.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people talking about it on the </v>

2663
01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Internet and all these online </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities that have formed,</v>

2664
01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.860
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me electric Jitsu has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of enthusiasm behind it right now.</v>

2665
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:51.950
<v Speaker 2>The gracie nationals and gracie world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they proved rose gracie prove that you </v>

2666
01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 2>can do submission only because before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was submission only.</v>

2667
01:54:56.361 --> 01:54:59.030
<v Speaker 2>What a submission only matched with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a a dream,</v>

2668
01:54:59.031 --> 01:55:00.980
<v Speaker 2>like a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

2669
01:55:00.981 --> 01:55:05.981
<v Speaker 2>what if gracie nationals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gracie world's made it work and then </v>

2670
01:55:05.981 --> 01:55:09.650
<v Speaker 2>metamorris did the whole prestigious </v>
<v Speaker 2>single match,</v>

2671
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC type event.</v>

2672
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.490
<v Speaker 2>And what do you think Abu Dhabi should </v>
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

2673
01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Because that's where all the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2674
01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 2>That guy has more money than anybody on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet should do.</v>

2675
01:55:17.061 --> 01:55:22.061
<v Speaker 2>Submission only Ebi rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not because I made it up as I personally</v>

2676
01:55:22.761 --> 01:55:26.210
<v Speaker 2>think I'm constantly changed like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime I'm tweaking it.</v>

2677
01:55:26.211 --> 01:55:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make it so that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2678
01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:30.320
<v Speaker 2>well what about if a dude does this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And overtime like,</v>

2679
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to change.</v>

2680
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I was having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a long conversation with John </v>

2681
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Banner about a month ago about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime.</v>

2682
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:37.530
<v Speaker 2>What do we do right here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm old.</v>

2683
01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to see a glaring problem.</v>

2684
01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do what the Japanese do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone presents a problem.</v>

2685
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

2686
01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:45.600
<v Speaker 1>let's make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to switch it.</v>

2687
01:55:45.601 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2688
01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:53.660
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shake of Abu Dhabi has the most </v>

2689
01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:54.780
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most enthusiasm.</v>

2690
01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:57.510
<v Speaker 1>He is a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy.</v>

2691
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody's to take shape,</v>

2692
01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:04.260
<v Speaker 1>top nunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's going to take this and </v>

2693
01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:05.901
<v Speaker 1>make it mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he should do each tournament on </v>

2694
01:56:05.901 --> 01:56:09.171
<v Speaker 1>a separate day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it like a week thing everyday at </v>

2695
01:56:09.171 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>different and just one movie that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see or maybe two a day,</v>

2696
01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:12.030
<v Speaker 1>you see it one at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stream it,</v>

2697
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:13.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it one at a time.</v>

2698
01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:16.030
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2699
01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I knew I had a feeling it was going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be that powerful when you </v>

2700
01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.831
<v Speaker 1>watch it unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we actually did Ebi wanting to </v>

2701
01:56:24.831 --> 01:56:24.831
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2702
01:56:24.831 --> 01:56:29.281
<v Speaker 1>it was incredible to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there were coming up to me and </v>

2703
01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:29.340
<v Speaker 1>saying constantly.</v>

2704
01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.100
<v Speaker 1>And I mean they were saying that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best tournament I've ever seen.</v>

2705
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It's only because they saw that way one </v>
<v Speaker 1>match at a time.</v>

2706
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.000
<v Speaker 1>By the time they got the GL Martinez and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Glover in the final triple </v>

2707
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.320
<v Speaker 1>overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place went nuts.</v>

2708
01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possible to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this and stream it like a</v>

2709
01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Netflix service?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a bunch of people already have the</v>

2710
01:56:50.341 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 1>service and all they have to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>click on it,</v>

2711
01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or an apple TV type deal where a lot of </v>

2712
01:56:57.490 --> 01:56:58.530
<v Speaker 1>people already have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get access to Netflix,</v>

2713
01:56:58.531 --> 01:57:00.630
<v Speaker 1>you get access to $70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million homes.</v>

2714
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.330
<v Speaker 1>There's still people that for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

2715
01:57:03.331 --> 01:57:08.331
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the ability to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet on their TV so you don't get </v>

2716
01:57:08.331 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people that do.</v>

2717
01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:11.580
<v Speaker 1>The people that have Internet connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>

2718
01:57:11.581 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fucking people have Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2719
01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much.</v>

2720
01:57:14.371 --> 01:57:17.940
<v Speaker 1>So they're sponsoring television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making their own shows.</v>

2721
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 1>They got this Marco Polo show that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking dope dude.</v>

2722
01:57:20.881 --> 01:57:25.881
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a really expensive show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could tell they spent a lot of </v>

2723
01:57:25.881 --> 01:57:29.451
<v Speaker 1>money making this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down to take Abi to the ultimate </v>

2724
01:57:29.451 --> 01:57:29.451
<v Speaker 1>heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want.</v>

2725
01:57:29.730 --> 01:57:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I want you Jitsu on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why we can't have a </v>

2726
01:57:34.730 --> 01:57:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu TV on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have dog Frisbee,</v>

2727
01:57:35.490 --> 01:57:39.250
<v Speaker 1>we have all this crazy Frisbee dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling tractor trailers with teeth.</v>

2728
01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2729
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:44.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't put metamorris on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put Abudabi on TV.</v>

2730
01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>

2731
01:57:45.811 --> 01:57:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be some mission only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be Nogi.</v>

2732
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:50.840
<v Speaker 1>If it's going to be on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't going to see on TV.</v>

2733
01:57:50.850 --> 01:57:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Have better chance putting chess on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2734
01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you with that.</v>

2735
01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:59.210
<v Speaker 1>There's just a lot of matches that wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>up being stalemates where they're </v>

2736
01:57:59.210 --> 01:57:59.550
<v Speaker 1>holding onto the collar and it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2737
01:57:59.690 --> 01:58:03.090
<v Speaker 1>it's as much as it's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning tool and it's a great.</v>

2738
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It's great to learn that if you get in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight with someone who's got a winter </v>

2739
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:11.001
<v Speaker 1>coat on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is when we're looking at </v>

2740
01:58:11.001 --> 01:58:12.210
<v Speaker 1>sport like combat sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at Jujitsu,</v>

2741
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.360
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at Jujitsu and MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be interchangeable and </v>

2742
01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:17.820
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not interchangeable.</v>

2743
01:58:17.821 --> 01:58:19.880
<v Speaker 1>When you have a gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are when you have no gate,</v>

2744
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.350
<v Speaker 1>so it seems pretty cut and dry straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

2745
01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if someone just wants to do </v>

2746
01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and ag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to do.</v>

2747
01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to do it.</v>

2748
01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to slow the game down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2749
01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.590
<v Speaker 1>a lot of older guys like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of that reason.</v>

2750
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like chess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chess is a great game to play.</v>

2751
01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:35.910
<v Speaker 1>You have to be really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2752
01:58:35.911 --> 01:58:36.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2753
01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:41.220
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to put it on Fox </v>

2754
01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:42.850
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with Jujitsu with the gay.</v>

2755
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 1>But I agree that for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Nogi,</v>

2756
01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:50.960
<v Speaker 1>like the difference between Nogi is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just smoothly transitions into mma </v>

2757
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:56.000
<v Speaker 1>except for a few variables like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting punched when you go in for leg </v>

2758
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.921
<v Speaker 1>locks and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UFC is the hottest rising sport on </v>

2759
01:58:58.921 --> 01:59:02.131
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's millions and millions and </v>

2760
01:59:02.131 --> 01:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>millions of fans all over the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are rabid fans of the UFC.</v>

2761
01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:06.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why there can't be 1 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million of those fans that are into Nogi</v>

2762
01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu because really it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing just without the striking.</v>

2763
01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:14.580
<v Speaker 1>It's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same objective during the same </v>

2764
01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:15.280
<v Speaker 1>positions standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no striking,</v>

2765
01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:20.281
<v Speaker 1>but it's if you love mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to appreciate some </v>

2766
01:59:20.281 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 1>good grappling his office as exciting.</v>

2767
01:59:22.090 --> 01:59:23.200
<v Speaker 1>The formats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2768
01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:25.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no points and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:30.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a single matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why you can get a </v>

2770
01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.380
<v Speaker 1>fraction of all those UFC fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realistically,</v>

2771
01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm low balling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's done right.</v>

2772
01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:39.220
<v Speaker 1>If it's done right and marketed right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you can get 25 percent,</v>

2773
01:59:39.221 --> 01:59:44.221
<v Speaker 1>40 percent see there being some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cable television show where they do </v>

2774
01:59:44.221 --> 01:59:44.221
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2775
01:59:44.221 --> 01:59:47.560
<v Speaker 1>like a spike TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like spike TV has Friday night,</v>

2776
01:59:47.561 --> 01:59:49.960
<v Speaker 1>they have all combat sports now they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have boxing,</v>

2777
01:59:49.961 --> 01:59:53.260
<v Speaker 1>they're having glory and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this TV.</v>

2778
01:59:53.890 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 1>That's why I got as many people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2779
01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a big drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a big drop in access over spike of</v>

2780
02:00:00.161 --> 02:00:01.780
<v Speaker 1>giant drop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really big drop.</v>

2781
02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Spike is in way more households than </v>
<v Speaker 1>access TV is millions and millions more.</v>

2782
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Way More.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2783
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2784
02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe Jamie could find out the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

2785
02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had to guess I'd have differences.</v>

2786
02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Probably like $50 million plus it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect on spike.</v>

2787
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that kind of a place where you </v>

2788
02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>would get where people were already </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it,</v>

2789
02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>you know they've already got it tuned </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2790
02:00:21.071 --> 02:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's anything wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>access TV,</v>

2791
02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>access TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some awesome fights.</v>

2792
02:00:24.641 --> 02:00:29.641
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get lion fights like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only place where you could </v>

2793
02:00:29.641 --> 02:00:29.641
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Lions.</v>

2794
02:00:29.641 --> 02:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever watch it live and what's that?</v>

2795
02:00:31.051 --> 02:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2796
02:00:31.431 --> 02:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lion fight is probably the number one </v>

2797
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>more tie organization in America as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as exposure because of television.</v>

2798
02:00:38.170 --> 02:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Like Kevin Ross was legit and boy guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>with more rules bigger than glory.</v>

2799
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's.</v>

2800
02:00:43.471 --> 02:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Gloria is not Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloria's kickboxing.</v>

2801
02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>The difference being you can't clench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't throw a nice.</v>

2802
02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>The body can throw elbows in the clench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do a lot of things that you do</v>

2803
02:00:51.671 --> 02:00:56.671
<v Speaker 1>in white tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Moitai real more tied oftentimes </v>

2804
02:00:56.671 --> 02:01:00.451
<v Speaker 1>winds up being a grapple fest where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab a hold of each other in a blast </v>

2805
02:01:00.451 --> 02:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>each other with knees to the body along </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ropes.</v>

2806
02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big part of [inaudible] if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch it in Thailand,</v>

2807
02:01:04.330 --> 02:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>we watched some high level matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys clench up with each other and</v>

2808
02:01:07.151 --> 02:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>they blast each other with the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dump each other,</v>

2809
02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:14.221
<v Speaker 1>they sweep each other all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different thing when you're </v>

2810
02:01:14.221 --> 02:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>adding in knees and elbows and Gloria </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have that,</v>

2811
02:01:17.051 --> 02:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>just like k one didn't have that k one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only for a while you could throw</v>

2812
02:01:20.981 --> 02:01:25.981
<v Speaker 1>elbows with two knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then a lot of dudes came over there </v>

2813
02:01:25.981 --> 02:01:25.981
<v Speaker 1>and it just blasted guy or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2814
02:01:25.981 --> 02:01:29.050
<v Speaker 1>two hands behind the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became illegal to even throw</v>

2815
02:01:29.051 --> 02:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>knees with two hands behind the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only use one hand behind that.</v>

2816
02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>The owner of glory came to you and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2817
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I respect your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think we should do with the </v>

2818
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>rules of surely go full moly.</v>

2819
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Tie with 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>abso-fucking-lutely.</v>

2820
02:01:41.050 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>How long can they cleanse a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport?</v>

2821
02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more exciting.</v>

2822
02:01:44.301 --> 02:01:49.301
<v Speaker 1>It's the true art of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The true art of standup involves </v>

2823
02:01:49.301 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>throwing stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing strikes in the clench,</v>

2824
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>throwing stuff like Moitai involves a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of elbows in tight Moitai evolves </v>

2825
02:01:55.810 --> 02:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>manipulating bodies and leading people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into knees leading like Allen Joe Ban,</v>

2826
02:01:59.750 --> 02:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>perfect example and his last UFC bout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way turn that dude into that elbow </v>

2827
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>that is more Thai applied to mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a combination of grappling </v>

2828
02:02:09.490 --> 02:02:14.471
<v Speaker 1>your opponent and striking and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big part of Moitai and you don't see </v>

2829
02:02:14.471 --> 02:02:18.851
<v Speaker 1>that as much in glory because I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was along the lines of what they were </v>

2830
02:02:18.851 --> 02:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>trying to do with k one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

2831
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>They thought it would be make it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting if you had less clinching,</v>

2832
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>more exciting and the guys wouldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut up,</v>

2833
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>which is what they're worried about for </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournament's.</v>

2834
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>But I think tournament's was striking is</v>
<v Speaker 1>super fucking dangerous anyway.</v>

2835
02:02:30.570 --> 02:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I think they're asking for trouble by </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a guy like Joe Schilling,</v>

2836
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:38.891
<v Speaker 1>five three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting Simon motherfucking </v>

2837
02:02:38.891 --> 02:02:38.891
<v Speaker 1>Marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2838
02:02:38.891 --> 02:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>and then after Simon mark is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting Wayne motherfucking Barrett.</v>

2839
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>And then after that he's fighting art </v>
<v Speaker 1>and motherfucking 11 to three,</v>

2840
02:02:44.630 --> 02:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>the baddest motherfuckers on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're throwing head kicks and </v>

2841
02:02:49.630 --> 02:02:53.261
<v Speaker 1>punches and elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have elbows in there because </v>

2842
02:02:53.261 --> 02:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you get cut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the the idea of tournament's,</v>

2843
02:02:55.970 --> 02:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>you're preserving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure the fights happen more </v>

2844
02:03:00.970 --> 02:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it.</v>

2845
02:03:00.970 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>You would've killed the kicking each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other in the head.</v>

2846
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Shin kicks the head cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You open like a fucking cerated knife.</v>

2847
02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean that can happen all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're always going to wind the </v>

2848
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:11.000
<v Speaker 1>risk of the guy not being able to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the finals if he gets head kicked.</v>

2849
02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:14.630
<v Speaker 1>No towards events into dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring back full time.</v>

2850
02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Full Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No tournament's use tournament's for </v>

2851
02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>grappling tournaments are awesome for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

2852
02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>for Ebi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Metamorris tournament to the way to </v>

2853
02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>go for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for kickboxing,</v>

2854
02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:26.480
<v Speaker 1>100 percent Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more effective art.</v>

2855
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it too late for them to tweak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Committed to these.</v>

2856
02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:31.460
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no,</v>

2857
02:03:31.461 --> 02:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>it's never too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They own the company.</v>

2858
02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:34.310
<v Speaker 1>They own the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switch it up.</v>

2859
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have bell tour.</v>

2860
02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Then they have a way more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport anyway.</v>

2861
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>As far as like with the public's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception would be because you're </v>

2862
02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>adding in takedowns and submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just adding,</v>

2863
02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you're just adding elbows and knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should totally be able to do that </v>

2864
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and then more time in the clench allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys to clench because those guys like a</v>

2865
02:03:51.231 --> 02:03:53.570
<v Speaker 1>guy like Simon Marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take away his clinch,</v>

2866
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:55.160
<v Speaker 1>you take away a big part of his game.</v>

2867
02:03:55.190 --> 02:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>A lot of his game is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really strong guy who's </v>

2868
02:04:00.190 --> 02:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plum.</v>

2869
02:04:00.190 --> 02:04:02.240
<v Speaker 1>He manipulates dudes and he's blasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the by boom,</v>

2870
02:04:02.241 --> 02:04:04.160
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of his fucking game.</v>

2871
02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:05.660
<v Speaker 1>A huge part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elbows in the clench.</v>

2872
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge part.</v>

2873
02:04:07.131 --> 02:04:12.131
<v Speaker 1>You take that away and you're forcing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to just kick box and I just think </v>

2874
02:04:12.131 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still Fun.</v>

2875
02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Glories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome to watch.</v>

2876
02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Still exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not as good as if it was like full </v>

2877
02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:18.980
<v Speaker 1>more tyrell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2878
02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he's going to take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>

2879
02:04:20.091 --> 02:04:25.091
<v Speaker 1>I hope so man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because full Mike more tight rules is </v>

2880
02:04:25.091 --> 02:04:25.310
<v Speaker 1>also way more technical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch and way more like you.</v>

2881
02:04:25.311 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>You never know what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy like Kevin Ross,</v>

2882
02:04:27.621 --> 02:04:28.850
<v Speaker 1>he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a perfect example.</v>

2883
02:04:28.851 --> 02:04:32.300
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who fights total Thai style </v>
<v Speaker 1>or like bull a cow.</v>

2884
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:35.300
<v Speaker 1>When you see that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use everything knees to the body,</v>

2885
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:38.000
<v Speaker 1>elbows in the clench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upward coming in,</v>

2886
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:43.010
<v Speaker 2>step off to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg kicks across the front of the thigh </v>

2887
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.010
<v Speaker 2>to use in all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>

2888
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of the clench needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The body needs,</v>

2889
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:45.750
<v Speaker 2>the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elbows,</v>

2890
02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:47.900
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is a part of the sport </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

2891
02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to make it more exciting.</v>

2892
02:04:49.690 --> 02:04:54.690
<v Speaker 2>That's when elite ECC were saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go to the ground but only for 15 </v>

2893
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:55.460
<v Speaker 2>seconds and then you have to stay on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your backup.</v>

2894
02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.030
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't fucking mma.</v>

2895
02:04:57.330 --> 02:05:02.330
<v Speaker 2>When big country had our Laski down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was working at Kamora and they stood </v>

2896
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:04.290
<v Speaker 2>him up from side control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's inside control.</v>

2897
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:09.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got the risk pin down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's feeding his arm through and he's </v>

2898
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:11.130
<v Speaker 2>about to try to attempt to comorbidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're standing up and we're like,</v>

2899
02:05:11.131 --> 02:05:16.131
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times where it was there a bad </v>

2900
02:05:16.131 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 2>stand up during a UFC fight?</v>

2901
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:18.930
<v Speaker 2>When I was in your ear and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2902
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2903
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>

2904
02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:26.880
<v Speaker 2>you let it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love anytime there's a quick setup.</v>

2905
02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Anytime there's any standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it when you say something I </v>

2906
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:33.900
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be at all exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only five minutes.</v>

2907
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:39.140
<v Speaker 2>You have five minutes to get a guy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and submit them and the guys </v>

2908
02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>trying to kick your fucking head off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that you should be stood back up </v>

2909
02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>because it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2910
02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>if it's boring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know what's going to happen.</v>

2911
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Less people going to buy your paper view</v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

2912
02:05:45.931 --> 02:05:47.670
<v Speaker 2>People are going to pay to see you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2913
02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:50.670
<v Speaker 2>You're going to make less money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to finish guys,</v>

2914
02:05:50.671 --> 02:05:53.520
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The market should dictate your style.</v>

2915
02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:57.300
<v Speaker 2>The rules should be the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and fighting.</v>

2916
02:05:57.390 --> 02:06:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes a guy like ben asked when can </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold you down and do whatever the fuck </v>

2917
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:05.070
<v Speaker 2>he wants and the idea that you get to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>stood up.</v>

2918
02:06:05.071 --> 02:06:07.560
<v Speaker 2>You get a second shot at kicking his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking teeth in.</v>

2919
02:06:07.690 --> 02:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took,</v>

2920
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.620
<v Speaker 2>he took you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he held you down.</v>

2921
02:06:10.621 --> 02:06:15.621
<v Speaker 2>Especially when every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when every Ralph start </v>

2922
02:06:15.621 --> 02:06:16.490
<v Speaker 2>standing up for the striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2923
02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:21.060
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted a to lead that fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

2924
02:06:21.061 --> 02:06:26.061
<v Speaker 2>that was totally fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the fight ends up there on the </v>

2925
02:06:26.061 --> 02:06:29.721
<v Speaker 2>ground in the amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next round should start just like </v>

2926
02:06:29.721 --> 02:06:29.721
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the amount,</v>

2927
02:06:29.721 --> 02:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2928
02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Now you starting standing up again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I think.</v>

2929
02:06:32.671 --> 02:06:37.671
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be more exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if they just let the market </v>

2930
02:06:37.671 --> 02:06:38.160
<v Speaker 2>dictate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let it decide.</v>

2931
02:06:38.161 --> 02:06:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Just the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it more primitive,</v>

2932
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 2>make less rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the f out of the mix,</v>

2933
02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:48.960
<v Speaker 2>get them out mixed with block subjective</v>
<v Speaker 2>tires and they're like,</v>

2934
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:53.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever subjective ideas he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's what's good or what's not?</v>

2935
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Come on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta fight.</v>

2936
02:06:54.930 --> 02:06:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2937
02:06:55.891 --> 02:06:57.960
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting with the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're doing?</v>

2938
02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:00.420
<v Speaker 2>You see that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and that guy in the leg that's called</v>

2939
02:07:00.421 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 2>fighting or is telling the rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them fight.</v>

2940
02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:06.540
<v Speaker 2>That was the Gary Shaw thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxi.</v>

2941
02:07:06.690 --> 02:07:11.100
<v Speaker 2>He told them to stand people up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got guys like Orlowski wind up</v>

2942
02:07:11.101 --> 02:07:16.101
<v Speaker 2>knocking big country out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of fucked up because big </v>

2943
02:07:16.101 --> 02:07:17.160
<v Speaker 2>country was dominating that fight and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stayed on the ground,</v>

2944
02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 2>he probably would have stayed on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2945
02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't see our last people reversing </v>
<v Speaker 2>big country,</v>

2946
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:23.220
<v Speaker 2>big countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is legit.</v>

2947
02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:28.340
<v Speaker 2>He's a big fucking strong dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's working for a position that he </v>

2948
02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:28.620
<v Speaker 2>earned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got you to the ground.</v>

2949
02:07:28.621 --> 02:07:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll grow lawsky.</v>

2950
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:36.350
<v Speaker 2>You get them to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get them inside control and some </v>

2951
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:39.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking sole job of a promoter decides </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to stand these guys up </v>

2952
02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:40.480
<v Speaker 2>because they want war.</v>

2953
02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:42.920
<v Speaker 2>The crowd wants war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're fighting.</v>

2954
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:47.680
<v Speaker 2>We're not spit and fucking Salami </v>
<v Speaker 2>sandwiches flying out of his mouth is.</v>

2955
02:07:47.681 --> 02:07:50.380
<v Speaker 2>He's talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy gets to dictate what happens in</v>

2956
02:07:50.381 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>a professional martial arts event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

2957
02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:59.250
<v Speaker 2>How crazy would it be if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead that took out standups and you </v>

2958
02:07:59.250 --> 02:08:00.730
<v Speaker 2>started the next round?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2959
02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:02.590
<v Speaker 2>In the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How hard would that be?</v>

2960
02:08:02.591 --> 02:08:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that hard?</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it should be.</v>

2964
02:08:07.301 --> 02:08:10.240
<v Speaker 2>If people want to have a break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get back up,</v>

2965
02:08:10.330 --> 02:08:12.070

<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2966
02:08:12.210 --> 02:08:15.340
<v Speaker 2>If a guy takes you down and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fucking you mounted,</v>

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:20.920
<v Speaker 2>She didn't solve that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't solve that issue.</v>

2969
02:08:21.250 --> 02:08:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Got An issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2971
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:24.910
<v Speaker 2>You punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is on the school yard,</v>

2972
02:08:24.911 --> 02:08:28.660
<v Speaker 2>if this isn't a fucking field somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy would still be on top of you.</v>

2973
02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>your cardio back to make it more </v>

2975
02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:34.660
<v Speaker 2>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's it.</v>

2976
02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

2977
02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:37.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a little suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be the fight should be 10 minutes.</v>

2978
02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the presenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many fight should be 10 minutes and the </v>

2979
02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:43.540
<v Speaker 2>main events should be 15 or 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fucking breaks.</v>

2980
02:08:43.541 --> 02:08:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm down with that hell breaks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

2982
02:08:46.391 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA is not rounds.</v>

2983
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the girls would get upset.</v>

2984
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:52.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't get to walk around every five</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

2985
02:08:52.331 --> 02:08:57.331
<v Speaker 2>Their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would still be there at the </v>

2986
02:08:57.331 --> 02:08:57.850
<v Speaker 2>beginning and the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just be a few less of these,</v>

2987
02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.350
<v Speaker 2>a few less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's.</v>

2988
02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.160
<v Speaker 2>They still are an integral part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

2989
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:04.600
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fun to be around.</v>

2990
02:09:04.601 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with octagon girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong.</v>

2991
02:09:06.761 --> 02:09:09.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not an anti octagon grow rant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love those girls.</v>

2992
02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.720
<v Speaker 2>It's importance of freight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's listed?</v>

<v Speaker 2>for gays,</v>

2996
02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.540
<v Speaker 2>transgenders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight people that like watching dudes</v>

2997
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:28.090
<v Speaker 2>in their underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a good representation of the</v>

2998
02:09:28.091 --> 02:09:30.430
<v Speaker 2>male form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a small market.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I could smile that he can't hold.</v>

3004

<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you gotta look the corners of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mouth,</v>

3005
02:09:46.121 --> 02:09:46.960
<v Speaker 2>they start shaking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There will be gay guys are notoriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>fit.</v>

3011
02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would,</v>

3012

<v Speaker 2>balls in their face to.</v>

3015
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:12.880
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they should be obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

3016
02:10:12.881 --> 02:10:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It should be there probably on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>national sport.</v>

3017
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is going to inspire them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come clean with it.</v>

3018
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a lot of dudes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to just take the regular </v>

<v Speaker 2>you're upset before the match even </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts,</v>

3032
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.210
<v Speaker 2>you gotta let the guy have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to get hard and they say,</v>

3049
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:49.970
<v Speaker 2>percent going to go up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>together turns them on.</v>

3087
02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Same in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Italy.</v>

3088
02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:28.490
<v Speaker 2>In Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3090
02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Those are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Twenty percent of women that you </v>

3091
02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:38.031
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe higher and it turns you on.</v>

3092
02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not watching to laugh.</v>

3093
02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Gay Girl Porn or gay men porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3094
02:13:44.050 --> 02:13:49.050
<v Speaker 2>We got to end this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I throw us about the throat microphone I</v>

3095
02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:56.140
<v Speaker 2>mailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was through watching some dude balls </v>

3096
02:13:56.140 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>deep in another guy's ass and a girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing with herself.</v>

3097
02:13:57.030 --> 02:14:00.450
<v Speaker 2>That's the last two month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egos are so strong.</v>

3098
02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:05.580
<v Speaker 2>It's so important for us to not get </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated by another man.</v>

3099
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:08.040
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his balls are right here.</v>

3100
02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going almost stop the choke right </v>

3101
02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:13.130
<v Speaker 2>here and his balls are right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3102
02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:14.730
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hurt more.</v>

3103
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 2>If he taps me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then have his balls hit my cheek.</v>

3104
02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Just like blocking the chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3105
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:25.070
<v Speaker 2>It's more important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking about any sexuality </v>

3106
02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:25.070
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Jujitsu,</v>

3107
02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapped.</v>

3108
02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:26.400
<v Speaker 2>You Band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tie Cups,</v>

3109
02:14:26.401 --> 02:14:29.130
<v Speaker 2>those steel cups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't bet anything.</v>

3110
02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:34.460
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You allow guys to wear those steel </v>

3111
02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:34.460
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they wear,</v>

3112
02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:36.771
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stop them from </v>

3113
02:14:36.771 --> 02:14:36.771
<v Speaker 2>protecting their balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3114
02:14:36.771 --> 02:14:37.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is there's leverage.</v>

3115
02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that Gary,</v>

3116
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that it's increased leverage anywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Steel Cup?</v>

3117
02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Certainly more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Break arms,</v>

3118
02:14:44.341 --> 02:14:46.260
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you wear one?</v>

3119
02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:47.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want one.</v>

3120
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:48.420
<v Speaker 2>When I compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just never have.</v>

3121
02:14:48.421 --> 02:14:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So it would.</v>

3122
02:14:49.110 --> 02:14:51.230
<v Speaker 2>It would be awkward to start doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right before.</v>

3123
02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:52.830
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there'll be a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>

3124
02:14:52.831 --> 02:14:54.060
<v Speaker 2>If it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be some.</v>

3125
02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Some organizations been cups in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

3126
02:14:57.380 --> 02:14:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it'll leverage.</v>

3127
02:14:59.370 --> 02:15:01.290
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got another Einstein Story.</v>

3128
02:15:01.291 --> 02:15:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Einstein was passing my guard and he hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Dick with his knee.</v>

3129
02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think anything of it until I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to the bathroom.</v>

3130
02:15:07.411 --> 02:15:09.900
<v Speaker 2>After I was done rolling in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My jock strap was filled with blood.</v>

3131
02:15:10.090 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple years now and so I started.</v>

3132
02:15:13.741 --> 02:15:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I peed and blood came out of my Dick.</v>

3133
02:15:15.721 --> 02:15:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was trying to think,</v>

3134
02:15:17.070 --> 02:15:19.230
<v Speaker 2>should I go to the doctor because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I went to the doctor,</v>

3135
02:15:19.231 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>like I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3136
02:15:19.951 --> 02:15:21.450
<v Speaker 2>what would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was my nose,</v>

3137
02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't go to the doctor?</v>

3138
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I would see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went home and a little bit more </v>

3139
02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:28.130
<v Speaker 2>important than your nose though.</v>

3140
02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:28.500
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I went on when I jerked off,</v>

3141
02:15:28.501 --> 02:15:33.501
<v Speaker 2>I just want to make sure my dick works </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my sperm was like the cover of the </v>

3142
02:15:34.141 --> 02:15:36.420
<v Speaker 2>metallica album load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's blood and sperm.</v>

3143
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of them chicken eggs </v>
<v Speaker 2>where something went wrong,</v>

3144
02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get one of those chicken eggs,</v>

3145
02:15:40.231 --> 02:15:41.790
<v Speaker 2>it's got a little fetus in it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3146
02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was clumps,</v>

3147
02:15:43.530 --> 02:15:47.730
<v Speaker 2>but it worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did work out and then I peed.</v>

3148
02:15:47.970 --> 02:15:50.220
<v Speaker 2>The next day was I had blood for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>days though.</v>

3149
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:52.050
<v Speaker 2>It was blood that was coming out for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few days,</v>

3150
02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.880
<v Speaker 2>but it never got infected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3151
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:59.030
<v Speaker 2>if it feels infected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to the doctor because </v>

3152
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.030
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they're gonna be staring at my</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>

3153
02:15:59.030 --> 02:16:02.851
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They going to put q tips up there and </v>

3154
02:16:02.851 --> 02:16:02.851
<v Speaker 2>then probably say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably not going to do anything</v>

3155
02:16:02.851 --> 02:16:02.851
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

3156
02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:08.040
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you made the right call and is cops are </v>

3157
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the way to go because that shit wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have happened.</v>

3158
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially like a steel cup.</v>

3159
02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Constantly squeezing my knees and every </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my game,</v>

3160
02:16:12.541 --> 02:16:17.541
<v Speaker 2>the needs are generally squeezing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm in constant protect ball mode </v>

3161
02:16:17.541 --> 02:16:18.870
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't wear makeup?</v>

3162
02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever wear one of those diamonds?</v>

3163
02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.980
<v Speaker 2>You ever try those diamond and try it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and never.</v>

3164
02:16:23.010 --> 02:16:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Would you be interested in trying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got them here.</v>

3165
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:29.750
<v Speaker 2>You want one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid balls are going to hang out </v>

3166
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 2>and then someone's gonna Smash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom like vandelay Silva.</v>

3167
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like compression shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met Gilbert Ivo vandelay Silva us,</v>

3168
02:16:33.131 --> 02:16:38.131
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ball got caught after that guy was </v>

3169
02:16:38.131 --> 02:16:39.430
<v Speaker 2>laying on the floor longer than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

3170
02:16:39.431 --> 02:16:41.680
<v Speaker 2>You know that pain you get where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like you're going to get sick.</v>

3171
02:16:41.950 --> 02:16:44.560
<v Speaker 2>He had other kind of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a ball smashed.</v>

3172
02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there.</v>

3173
02:16:45.570 --> 02:16:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I think he had a regular cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those regular cups,</v>

3174
02:16:47.621 --> 02:16:50.530
<v Speaker 2>so this is way before they had these </v>
<v Speaker 2>compression short cups.</v>

3175
02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jocko does them to a couple of </v>

3176
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but diamond mma,</v>

3177
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I think they started it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a cop that's contoured.</v>

3178
02:16:57.490 --> 02:16:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go grab one of those things.</v>

3179
02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:00.490
<v Speaker 2>They need to take a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sent them to me.</v>

3180
02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any affiliation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this company.</v>

3181
02:17:02.141 --> 02:17:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say they need to take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mold of your Dick and then make a mold.</v>

3182
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Rubber Jelly thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3183
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3184
02:17:09.371 --> 02:17:10.270
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's soft.</v>

3185
02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought about what if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick gets hard.</v>

3186
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:14.770
<v Speaker 2>It gets trapped and it's like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>choking your dick out.</v>

3187
02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:16.730
<v Speaker 2>You're to question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's we haven't.</v>

3188
02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:19.840
<v Speaker 2>He wants to make like mouthpieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3189
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:24.910
<v Speaker 2>like a mouthpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an earpiece mouthpiece or one of </v>

3190
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.910
<v Speaker 2>those ear.</v>

3191
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:26.890
<v Speaker 2>You just can't ever get turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3192
02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why would you.</v>

3193
02:17:28.691 --> 02:17:30.850
<v Speaker 2>It's Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's other sweaty dudes.</v>

3194
02:17:30.851 --> 02:17:33.030
<v Speaker 2>See they have a cup that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>contoured.</v>

3195
02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:34.690
<v Speaker 2>And Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is.</v>

3196
02:17:34.691 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the way to go.</v>

3197
02:17:35.681 --> 02:17:39.640
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea that the point is if your</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick is hanging out,</v>

3198
02:17:39.641 --> 02:17:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3199
02:17:40.781 --> 02:17:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you were with these compression shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These shorts are crazy.</v>

3200
02:17:43.301 --> 02:17:48.301
<v Speaker 2>They have all these straps in them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the suck that thing right up </v>

3201
02:17:48.301 --> 02:17:49.150
<v Speaker 2>against your junk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to protect your hawks on.</v>

3202
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:51.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Outside your pants.</v>

3203
02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:52.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just too.</v>

3204
02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I got a big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's thick.</v>

3205
02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big.</v>

3206
02:18:02.291 --> 02:18:04.120
<v Speaker 2>It's this thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than that.</v>

3207
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:05.770
<v Speaker 2>That's all you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should try it.</v>

3208
02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:11.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a commentator to match a </v>

3209
02:18:11.010 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Louis Fernando Vasconcellos and king of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cage,</v>

3210
02:18:11.111 --> 02:18:13.600
<v Speaker 2>and I forgot about Fernando against </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shonie.</v>

3211
02:18:13.601 --> 02:18:18.601
<v Speaker 2>Carter and Carter showed up at the cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it looked like actually sit on the </v>

3212
02:18:18.601 --> 02:18:18.601
<v Speaker 2>telecast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3213
02:18:18.601 --> 02:18:19.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3214
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:21.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Sapp called,</v>

3215
02:18:21.071 --> 02:18:25.390
<v Speaker 2>he wanted his cut back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his cup of so tremendous.</v>

3216
02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:30.540
<v Speaker 2>That was a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like something that you'd wear </v>

3217
02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:31.540
<v Speaker 2>the like Mad Max and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3218
02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Like anybody tried to kick him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls and there's like blades and shit </v>

3219
02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:36.960
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was huge.</v>

3220
02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:40.950
<v Speaker 2>But when you wrote with a guy who's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>one on a steel cup and they get on top </v>

3221
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.950
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feel that thing.</v>

3222
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're fucking.</v>

3223
02:18:42.731 --> 02:18:45.310
<v Speaker 2>You heard somebody ribs or combat like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3224
02:18:45.311 --> 02:18:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you hurt your sternum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your solar plexus,</v>

3225
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:48.300
<v Speaker 2>your like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3226
02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:51.010
<v Speaker 2>you want to get out of that position and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an arm bars.</v>

3227
02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:54.460
<v Speaker 2>It's got to make a giant difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big chunk of metal knee bars.</v>

3228
02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:59.720
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like an angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an angle like you have a </v>

3229
02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:02.611
<v Speaker 2>leverage point where your Dick and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you put a dude in a triangle and </v>

3230
02:19:02.611 --> 02:19:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you owe angle on their face is right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anytime you put a dude in a </v>

3231
02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:08.680
<v Speaker 2>triangle and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his head's just in the wrong angle.</v>

3232
02:19:08.681 --> 02:19:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Like if you pull this head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just like stuffing his head one.</v>

3233
02:19:13.090 --> 02:19:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to tap them with like </v>

3234
02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:18.320
<v Speaker 2>an arm or something here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the match.</v>

3235
02:19:18.321 --> 02:19:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want to talk to you about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Your Hobby Vasquez mad?</v>

3236
02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3237
02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was such a slick submission man </v>

3238
02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:25.920
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3239
02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you're known for your leg locks and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like hobby was defending.</v>

3240
02:19:27.861 --> 02:19:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3241
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:31.760
<v Speaker 6>an obvious really good defense anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you switched it up and went for</v>

3242
02:19:31.761 --> 02:19:33.740
<v Speaker 6>that triangle and cut the triangle on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the side.</v>

3243
02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:40.460
<v Speaker 6>As I move forward with my matches and </v>
<v Speaker 6>things like there's certain situations </v>

3244
02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:43.661
<v Speaker 6>where I'm just at all costs trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>submit somebody and beat them in </v>

3245
02:19:43.661 --> 02:19:44.660
<v Speaker 6>whatever way that I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I specifically in that match,</v>

3246
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:47.690
<v Speaker 6>I had every intention because I had just</v>
<v Speaker 6>beaten like a really good leg locker.</v>

3247
02:19:47.691 --> 02:19:52.691
<v Speaker 6>Marcin held.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had every intention of trying to not </v>

3248
02:19:52.691 --> 02:19:53.870
<v Speaker 6>submit them with a leg lock real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3249
02:19:53.871 --> 02:19:54.650
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3250
02:19:54.651 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to because I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be known as,</v>

3251
02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be known as just the guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>that does leg locks,</v>

3252
02:19:59.751 --> 02:20:04.751
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to be known as a fucking killer </v>

3253
02:20:04.751 --> 02:20:04.751
<v Speaker 6>on the map getting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But still,</v>

3254
02:20:04.751 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 6>you were still attempting them though.</v>

3255
02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:10.280
<v Speaker 6>But I caught them with Ronnie in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I had no intention of finishing it.</v>

3256
02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.920
<v Speaker 6>Rarely thought about finishing it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>

3257
02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:14.660
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not what I want to do.</v>

3258
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:17.270
<v Speaker 6>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried six different times.</v>

3259
02:20:17.271 --> 02:20:18.170
<v Speaker 6>I didn't let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3260
02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:20.300
<v Speaker 6>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pushed out of it really hard.</v>

3261
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.740
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3262
02:20:21.741 --> 02:20:23.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was I gonna say?</v>

3263
02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:23.420
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3264
02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:26.300
<v Speaker 6>multiple times I tried to set up an arm </v>
<v Speaker 6>triangle from,</v>

3265
02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 6>we'd call it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a scoop Scorpion,</v>

3266
02:20:28.611 --> 02:20:29.750
<v Speaker 6>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's it called?</v>

3267
02:20:30.130 --> 02:20:30.790
<v Speaker 6>Lockdown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3268
02:20:31.050 --> 02:20:33.860
<v Speaker 6>So from the lockdown position,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to pass his arm across and set up</v>

3269
02:20:33.861 --> 02:20:35.500
<v Speaker 6>arm triangle triangles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I had been wondering the bottom,</v>

3270
02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:37.100
<v Speaker 6>bottom and top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3271
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:39.110
<v Speaker 6>that's what I'd been practicing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>training.</v>

3272
02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:41.000
<v Speaker 6>That's how I wanted to submit them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't working out,</v>

3273
02:20:41.001 --> 02:20:43.010
<v Speaker 6>but I'd also been practicing some </v>
<v Speaker 6>triangle setups.</v>

3274
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:44.300
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

3275
02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:46.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's those two ways work.</v>

3276
02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:47.780
<v Speaker 6>I was kind of going back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 6>between that,</v>

3277
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:52.870
<v Speaker 6>trying to submit them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you set up the iron arm triangle </v>

3278
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:55.061
<v Speaker 6>from the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you try to finish it from the bottom </v>

3279
02:20:55.061 --> 02:20:55.061
<v Speaker 6>or do you sweet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3280
02:20:55.061 --> 02:20:55.061
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I,</v>

3281
02:20:55.061 --> 02:20:59.740
<v Speaker 6>my preferred finish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the absolute best for me is to be </v>

3282
02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:03.911
<v Speaker 6>slightly to be on bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to be on my hip as opposed to be </v>

3283
02:21:03.911 --> 02:21:05.030
<v Speaker 6>facing up towards the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so side onto the person perpendicular.</v>

3284
02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:06.680
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my favorite finish.</v>

3285
02:21:06.890 --> 02:21:07.880
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3286
02:21:07.881 --> 02:21:12.881
<v Speaker 6>saw aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>finishing it just directly flat facing </v>

3287
02:21:12.881 --> 02:21:12.881
<v Speaker 6>up I think is worse than finishing it on</v>
<v Speaker 6>top.</v>

3288
02:21:12.881 --> 02:21:14.570
<v Speaker 6>On top is better because you can move </v>
<v Speaker 6>your hips,</v>

3289
02:21:14.571 --> 02:21:17.210
<v Speaker 6>you can move on and I'll top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always better to get your weight,</v>

3290
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:22.570
<v Speaker 6>but on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only way it's going to work on the </v>

3291
02:21:22.570 --> 02:21:24.401
<v Speaker 6>bottom generally if you've got to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>that locked down in without the </v>

3292
02:21:24.401 --> 02:21:28.170
<v Speaker 6>lockdown,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because if I have the lockdown and I </v>

3293
02:21:28.170 --> 02:21:30.041
<v Speaker 6>have the arm trying on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to stay there and try to </v>

3294
02:21:30.041 --> 02:21:30.041
<v Speaker 6>finish it from there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't you?</v>

3295
02:21:30.041 --> 02:21:32.390
<v Speaker 6>You sometimes go sideways on a guy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have the lock down as well,</v>

3296
02:21:32.391 --> 02:21:37.391
<v Speaker 6>which puts your knee a really funky </v>
<v Speaker 6>angle talking about the arm chair and </v>

3297
02:21:37.391 --> 02:21:39.230
<v Speaker 6>going from the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from stoner control.</v>

3298
02:21:39.231 --> 02:21:41.520
<v Speaker 6>When the lead comes all the way till you</v>
<v Speaker 6>still hold the locked down.</v>

3299
02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:44.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like you go into the vaporizer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but instead you go for the arm triangle.</v>

3300
02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:45.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3301
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:46.660
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3302
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:48.860
<v Speaker 6>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a precarious position and you get</v>

3303
02:21:48.861 --> 02:21:53.861
<v Speaker 6>a lot of letters from there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to set that one up because </v>

3304
02:21:53.861 --> 02:21:56.741
<v Speaker 6>once you go through the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you still have the lockdown and it's </v>

3305
02:21:56.741 --> 02:21:57.980
<v Speaker 6>hard to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got really screwed up there and he's</v>

3306
02:21:57.981 --> 02:22:00.920
<v Speaker 6>got to kind of give it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to set that one up because you</v>

3307
02:22:00.921 --> 02:22:05.921
<v Speaker 6>set it up if you let go the lockdown to </v>
<v Speaker 6>pass the guard because you're basically </v>

3308
02:22:05.921 --> 02:22:06.710
<v Speaker 6>in a lead drag position with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>lockdown.</v>

3309
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:11.950
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can pass and commit to that arm </v>

3310
02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:15.341
<v Speaker 6>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could keep the lockdown role to a </v>

3311
02:22:15.341 --> 02:22:17.831
<v Speaker 6>vaporizer or you could get a vaporizer </v>
<v Speaker 6>by just simply turning and they're just </v>

3312
02:22:17.831 --> 02:22:20.580
<v Speaker 6>sitting back nice and slow where there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>no role and you go to it.</v>

3313
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:21.780
<v Speaker 6>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3314
02:22:21.890 --> 02:22:25.740
<v Speaker 6>your match was interesting because when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you guys were commentating on that match</v>

3315
02:22:25.741 --> 02:22:29.040
<v Speaker 6>to when you saw he got to that position,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the side trying to set up that triangle,</v>

3316
02:22:29.050 --> 02:22:30.000
<v Speaker 6>you got fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

3317
02:22:30.001 --> 02:22:31.900
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3318
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:32.720
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a,</v>

3319
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:34.650
<v Speaker 6>this is a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a bad spot.</v>

3320
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:36.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that Gary's,</v>

<v Speaker 6>But I know I've seen you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I know you got all around Jujitsu game </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I understand you and you don't want </v>

3325
02:22:49.881 --> 02:22:52.500
<v Speaker 6>to be known as the lead guy because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>do have really good,</v>

3326
02:22:52.501 --> 02:22:56.750
<v Speaker 6>like your guillotine is right up there </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the top guys and your,</v>

3327
02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:01.270
<v Speaker 6>the way you get to the back elite level,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3328
02:23:01.290 --> 02:23:02.370
<v Speaker 6>you got a lot of stuff going on.</v>

3329
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:06.080
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a very active game from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bottom a?</v>

3330
02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:08.290
<v Speaker 6>Was it a shock to me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3331
02:23:08.310 --> 02:23:10.650
<v Speaker 6>you've been training essentially Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 6>for about nine years.</v>

3332
02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:13.770
<v Speaker 6>It'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll be eight years,</v>

3333
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:15.000
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the day of his tournament,</v>

3334
02:23:15.001 --> 02:23:16.280
<v Speaker 6>March 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My jujitsu manner.</v>

3335
02:23:16.290 --> 02:23:21.290
<v Speaker 6>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've been able to have so much </v>

3336
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:21.290
<v Speaker 6>progress in such a short time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>

3337
02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:26.340
<v Speaker 6>You must really love it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You must be just fucking obsessed with </v>

3338
02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:26.340
<v Speaker 6>since day one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>

3339
02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.630
<v Speaker 6>I was just on the mat as much as </v>
<v Speaker 6>possible.</v>

3340
02:23:27.730 --> 02:23:32.730
<v Speaker 6>I never really took any breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just constantly training and </v>

3341
02:23:32.730 --> 02:23:36.921
<v Speaker 6>competing as much as I possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember what dragged you into </v>

3342
02:23:36.921 --> 02:23:36.921
<v Speaker 6>it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what got you so excited about it?</v>

3343
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:38.030
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3344
02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:39.840
<v Speaker 6>at first the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like the sport,</v>

3345
02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:43.980
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know it existed until I was 14 </v>
<v Speaker 6>and my buddy was like,</v>

3346
02:23:43.981 --> 02:23:44.400
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3347
02:23:44.401 --> 02:23:49.401
<v Speaker 6>I do this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of like wrestling where you </v>

3348
02:23:49.401 --> 02:23:49.401
<v Speaker 6>get to strangle people.</v>

3349
02:23:49.401 --> 02:23:49.401
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>data here,</v>

3350
02:23:49.401 --> 02:23:50.370
<v Speaker 6>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody lets that happen.</v>

3351
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:51.510
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a kid.</v>

3352
02:23:51.511 --> 02:23:53.670
<v Speaker 6>Like nobody likes to kids try and </v>
<v Speaker 6>strangle each other.</v>

3353
02:23:53.671 --> 02:23:55.140
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you didn't know me that UFC.</v>

3354
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:55.950
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3355
02:23:55.951 --> 02:23:57.120
<v Speaker 6>not at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

3356
02:23:57.121 --> 02:23:58.140
<v Speaker 6>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No idea.</v>

3357
02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:01.870
<v Speaker 6>So this is like four or five.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was living with a,</v>

3358
02:24:01.890 --> 02:24:03.790
<v Speaker 6>I was living with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was a single parent that,</v>

3359
02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:09.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean not that she would have </v>

3360
02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:09.020
<v Speaker 6>disapproved of that or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3361
02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:09.020
<v Speaker 6>but it's not like it would have been </v>
<v Speaker 6>something I would've been,</v>

3362
02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brought interest to,</v>

3363
02:24:10.591 --> 02:24:15.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't talk about it at school or </v>

3364
02:24:15.591 --> 02:24:15.591
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you heard about it,</v>

3365
02:24:15.591 --> 02:24:15.591
<v Speaker 6>but then look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3366
02:24:15.591 --> 02:24:16.050
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't,</v>

3367
02:24:16.090 --> 02:24:17.940
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't a big part of the culture that</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in.</v>

3368
02:24:17.941 --> 02:24:19.050
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I did,</v>

3369
02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:19.310
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3370
02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:24.320
<v Speaker 6>It just never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody ever really brought it up and </v>

3371
02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:24.320
<v Speaker 6>tell my one friend that happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>training Jujitsu.</v>

3372
02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:26.130
<v Speaker 6>Once I learned about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when I started learning about UFC</v>

3373
02:24:26.131 --> 02:24:27.030
<v Speaker 6>and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3374
02:24:27.031 --> 02:24:31.290
<v Speaker 6>I hadn't really experienced any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what got me into the sport,</v>

3375
02:24:31.291 --> 02:24:32.970
<v Speaker 6>but not like obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3376
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:33.690
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3377
02:24:33.691 --> 02:24:35.430
<v Speaker 6>that sounds really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Went to a competition.</v>

3378
02:24:35.470 --> 02:24:37.200
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the coolest fucking thing ever.</v>

3379
02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:39.360
<v Speaker 6>My mom was not about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

3380
02:24:39.450 --> 02:24:40.980
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not okay.</v>

3381
02:24:40.981 --> 02:24:44.160
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But eventually I convinced her and then,</v>

3382
02:24:44.161 --> 02:24:49.161
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what really kept pushing me forward was </v>

3383
02:24:49.161 --> 02:24:50.290
<v Speaker 6>the one turning point moment where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3384
02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:54.900
<v Speaker 6>I was training with Tom to blast my </v>
<v Speaker 6>instructor and I actually,</v>

3385
02:24:54.901 --> 02:24:57.290
<v Speaker 6>I was training with somebody else first </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

3386
02:24:57.291 --> 02:25:02.291
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to escape a triangle and </v>

3387
02:25:02.291 --> 02:25:04.790
<v Speaker 6>Tom comes over to help me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to try and help me get out of the </v>

3388
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.790
<v Speaker 6>triangle.</v>

3389
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:06.150
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't doing it properly and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like he,</v>

3390
02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:09.980
<v Speaker 6>he gave me advice and then I go oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I usually do this like,</v>

3391
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:13.430
<v Speaker 6>like in a very standoffish,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like talking back sort of a way like a,</v>

3392
02:25:13.570 --> 02:25:15.420
<v Speaker 6>like a child would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3393
02:25:15.421 --> 02:25:17.250
<v Speaker 6>So I talked back to him and it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>really bad,</v>

3394
02:25:17.251 --> 02:25:18.360
<v Speaker 6>like disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3395
02:25:18.570 --> 02:25:20.670
<v Speaker 6>in whatever way I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So Tom Goes,</v>

3396
02:25:20.671 --> 02:25:25.671
<v Speaker 6>oh okay let's train you now let's see </v>
<v Speaker 6>how well you get out of the triangle </v>

3397
02:25:25.671 --> 02:25:25.671
<v Speaker 6>then lets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lets go.</v>

3398
02:25:25.671 --> 02:25:28.480
<v Speaker 6>So he's trained with me for a grand </v>
<v Speaker 6>total of about 35 minutes.</v>

3399
02:25:28.481 --> 02:25:33.481
<v Speaker 6>I would say every two to five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 6>after he would submit me multiple times </v>

3400
02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:35.380
<v Speaker 6>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you want to stop?</v>

3401
02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:39.440
<v Speaker 6>And every time I was like no because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't think my beating was done.</v>

3402
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:41.740
<v Speaker 6>Like I thought I deserved to get the </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit kicked out of me.</v>

3403
02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:44.080
<v Speaker 6>So I didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had said something?</v>

3404
02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:49.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew right from the get go I fucked </v>

3405
02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:49.140
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3406
02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:50.920
<v Speaker 6>So he starts training to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get at the end of the match leads to a</v>

3407
02:25:50.921 --> 02:25:55.921
<v Speaker 6>start,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a sternum bruise the size of </v>

3408
02:25:55.921 --> 02:25:57.550
<v Speaker 6>Ironmans fucking circle on his chest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like d burn,</v>

3409
02:25:57.580 --> 02:26:01.240
<v Speaker 6>blood bloody cuts all over my face from </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking Eastbourne.</v>

3410
02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:02.860
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>literally it was,</v>

3411
02:26:02.890 --> 02:26:07.890
<v Speaker 6>it was definitely child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like should could have been arrested if </v>

3412
02:26:07.890 --> 02:26:07.890
<v Speaker 6>I like complained,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3413
02:26:07.890 --> 02:26:07.890
<v Speaker 6>but I would never,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3414
02:26:07.890 --> 02:26:09.700
<v Speaker 6>because I deserved it and it made me </v>

<v Speaker 6>act in that way.</v>

3430
02:26:36.881 --> 02:26:39.730
<v Speaker 6>And then from that point on when I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>in love with Jujitsu or eventually,</v>

3431
02:26:39.890 --> 02:26:44.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in love with competing and wanting to </v>

<v Speaker 6>if I wanted more.</v>

3436
02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:55.200
<v Speaker 6>Actually I do do that to my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to my student that I'm trying to bring </v>

<v Speaker 6>Gordon Ryan.</v>

3438
02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:59.490

<v Speaker 6>possible and try to demean him and make </v>

3439
02:26:59.490 --> 02:27:01.180

<v Speaker 1>better than him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like one of the hardest parts about </v>

<v Speaker 3>You were saying that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is breakdancing.</v>

3511
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Strength from the percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday I did an inside Bjj podcasts </v>

3512
02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:58.120
<v Speaker 3>and they asked me what is the single </v>
<v Speaker 3>most important attribute to Jiu Jitsu if</v>

3513
02:29:58.130 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 3>you only have one attribute.</v>

3514
02:29:59.930 --> 02:30:04.470
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my answer was initially was a,</v>

3515
02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:07.790
<v Speaker 3>I would like to say openmindedness true </v>
<v Speaker 3>open mindedness,</v>

3516
02:30:07.791 --> 02:30:12.791
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of close minded guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there that are the best in the </v>

3517
02:30:12.791 --> 02:30:12.791

02:30:12.791 --> 02:30:13.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be that.</v>

3519
02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I thought about it for two seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be athleticism,</v>

3520
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:20.690
<v Speaker 3>athleticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a guy coming in who's been doing</v>

<v Speaker 3>gymnastics his whole life and he's high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That guy's going to get really good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu in one month,</v>

3523
02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:29.900
<v Speaker 3>in one month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's Geo and his brother Boogie.</v>

02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Both of them just really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got their black belts.</v>

3525
02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:38.350
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their athleticism is just off the </v>

3526
02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:40.301
<v Speaker 3>charts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could do the craziest shit with </v>

3527
02:30:40.301 --> 02:30:40.400
<v Speaker 3>their hands standing on the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning around,</v>

3528
02:30:40.401 --> 02:30:42.020
<v Speaker 3>landing their balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their,</v>

<v Speaker 3>then you pick one hand up and then you </v>

3584
02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:11.820
<v Speaker 3>pick one leg up and then you lift the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other knee off the ground by two inches </v>

3585
02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:16.281
<v Speaker 3>and you're holding it there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one legs forward using like a </v>

3586
02:33:16.281 --> 02:33:16.281
<v Speaker 3>superman position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3587
02:33:16.281 --> 02:33:16.920
<v Speaker 3>You're in what you're holding yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with,</v>

3588
02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:21.921
<v Speaker 3>one hand and one foot on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your knee is off the ground and the </v>

3589
02:33:21.921 --> 02:33:24.060
<v Speaker 3>leg is up and the hand is up and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just holding it.</v>

3590
02:33:24.090 --> 02:33:29.090
<v Speaker 3>It's insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you gotta show me after I'll show </v>

3591
02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:30.030

<v Speaker 3>It's insanely difficult,</v>

3592
02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:31.890
<v Speaker 3>but then you think about what these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing.</v>

3593
02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:37.040
<v Speaker 3>They're standing on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're spinning around with their legs </v>

3594
02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.311
<v Speaker 3>up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that old school standard basic </v>

3595
02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:43.431
<v Speaker 3>breakdancing that you saw and it's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>their style is they do crazy weird </v>

3596
02:33:45.511 --> 02:33:50.511
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3597
02:33:50.511 --> 02:33:50.670
<v Speaker 3>and new and that translates to Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

3598
02:33:50.671 --> 02:33:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Better than wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than gymnastics.</v>

3599

<v Speaker 3>I've never seen it from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen them come up and his.</v>

3600
02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:00.270
<v Speaker 3>What he's doing is he's just getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

3601
02:34:00.271 --> 02:34:05.271
<v Speaker 3>This is just the beginning of Geo Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tone and break dancing moves your </v>

3602
02:34:06.721 --> 02:34:08.700
<v Speaker 3>cardboard with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You laid that shit out.</v>

3603
02:34:08.701 --> 02:34:13.260
<v Speaker 3>You started planning system is off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>charts too.</v>

3604
02:34:13.261 --> 02:34:15.650
<v Speaker 3>He's doing back flips like it's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3605
02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.300
<v Speaker 3>You can do a lot of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doing fly</v>

<v Speaker 6>So he's very arrogant.</v>

3609
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:26.950

<v Speaker 6>the past and it's like Braulio and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Adolfo and both of them are talking </v>

3657
02:36:13.861 --> 02:36:13.861
<v Speaker 6>I need a high dense amount of calories </v>
<v Speaker 6>all the time.</v>

02:36:13.861 --> 02:36:16.410
<v Speaker 6>So it's like cheeseburgers and pizza and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3664
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:29.620
<v Speaker 6>nutrients though?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you take that?</v>

3665
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:31.510
<v Speaker 6>Definitely take vitamins and things and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you know,</v>

3666
02:36:31.511 --> 02:36:32.590
<v Speaker 6>occasionally I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

3667
02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:34.630
<v Speaker 6>I'll pump in a few vegetables here and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.960
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3671
02:36:37.970 --> 02:36:38.430
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3672
02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:39.090
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3673
02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:40.640
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like real daily basis.</v>

3674
02:36:40.641 --> 02:36:42.610
<v Speaker 6>That's we need a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm the same one.</v>

3675
02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:47.940
<v Speaker 6>I eat a little salad everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a little bullshit El Pollo loco </v>

3676
02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:48.250
<v Speaker 6>salad or something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know to.</v>

3677
02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:50.290
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you just give it a shot,</v>

3678
02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:52.450
<v Speaker 6>just try drinking Kale shakes in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>morning.</v>

3679
02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:55.150
<v Speaker 6>Have a Kale shake instead of what you </v>
<v Speaker 6>normally have for breakfast.</v>

3680
02:36:55.151 --> 02:36:57.640
<v Speaker 6>It tastes like dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tastes like it.</v>

3681
02:36:57.641 --> 02:37:00.570
<v Speaker 6>Tastes like and that's all you pre-cum </v>
<v Speaker 6>will that.</v>

3682
02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:02.300
<v Speaker 6>Will that cover my vegetables for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>day?</v>

3683
02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:07.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine it would cover your </v>

3684
02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:07.320
<v Speaker 6>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

3685
02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:07.320
<v Speaker 6>That seems to be on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

3686
02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:07.720
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3687
02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:10.840
<v Speaker 6>you mix up some garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mix up some ginger,</v>

3688
02:37:10.841 --> 02:37:12.820
<v Speaker 6>like a hunk of ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a half a page.</v>

3689
02:37:12.821 --> 02:37:15.920
<v Speaker 6>You remember what a pager was like?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cut a pager in half that in the blue and</v>

3690
02:37:15.970 --> 02:37:16.270
<v Speaker 6>sounds</v>

3691
02:37:16.270 --> 02:37:17.660
<v Speaker 5>too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kale.</v>

3692
02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:18.850
<v Speaker 5>Celery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3693
02:37:18.851 --> 02:37:23.851
<v Speaker 5>That.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much effort that just went </v>

3694
02:37:23.851 --> 02:37:23.851
<v Speaker 5>into his garden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The chocolate flavor.</v>

3695
02:37:23.851 --> 02:37:25.370
<v Speaker 5>Is that good enough?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you look,</v>

3696
02:37:25.371 --> 02:37:30.371
<v Speaker 5>all those things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like either there's earth grown </v>

3697
02:37:30.371 --> 02:37:30.420
<v Speaker 5>nutrients at on and has garden of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has a bunch of drinks.</v>

3698
02:37:30.421 --> 02:37:32.690
<v Speaker 5>They bridget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very legit.</v>

3699
02:37:32.691 --> 02:37:33.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good stuff.</v>

3700
02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:35.690
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely better than not having </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3701
02:37:35.691 --> 02:37:38.210
<v Speaker 5>but the best shit you can get is fresh </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetables.</v>

3702
02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:41.090
<v Speaker 5>That's the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fresh vegetables with garlic.</v>

3703
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:45.590
<v Speaker 5>Some fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a maybe like a pineapple or apple,</v>

3704
02:37:45.650 --> 02:37:47.210
<v Speaker 5>some coconut oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mixed.</v>

3705
02:37:47.211 --> 02:37:50.090
<v Speaker 5>All that shit up together in a blend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things kicking everyone's ass,</v>

3706
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:53.650
<v Speaker 5>kicking everyone's ass going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're.</v>

3707
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:56.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that like,</v>

3708
02:37:56.130 --> 02:38:01.130
<v Speaker 5>you know that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me eating shitty is leading to me </v>

3709
02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:04.031
<v Speaker 5>winning or vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think that for longterm </v>

3710
02:38:04.031 --> 02:38:04.031
<v Speaker 5>health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

3711
02:38:04.031 --> 02:38:04.031
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I studied,</v>

3712
02:38:04.031 --> 02:38:05.990
<v Speaker 5>I studied exercise science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a degree in exercise science,</v>

3713
02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:11.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had nutrition classes and everything </v>

3714
02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:11.400
<v Speaker 5>like that and it's clearly you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

3715
02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:14.540
<v Speaker 5>for your longterm health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like eating well is like the right thing</v>

3716
02:38:14.541 --> 02:38:17.210
<v Speaker 5>to do just as much as exercising is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right thing to do.</v>

3717
02:38:17.210 --> 02:38:22.210
<v Speaker 5>But in terms of just my ability to do so</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a day to day basis with my training </v>

3718
02:38:22.491 --> 02:38:24.170
<v Speaker 5>schedule and with everything else is </v>
<v Speaker 5>just very,</v>

3719
02:38:24.171 --> 02:38:25.460
<v Speaker 5>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't make sense,</v>

3720
02:38:25.490 --> 02:38:28.190
<v Speaker 5>but I don't take as much stock into it </v>
<v Speaker 5>as some people believe like,</v>

3721
02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:33.460
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is going to be that deciding </v>

3722
02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:35.591
<v Speaker 5>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that point one percent that's going to </v>

3723
02:38:35.591 --> 02:38:36.290
<v Speaker 5>make you beat So-and-so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't truly believe that,</v>

3724
02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:36.940
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3725
02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:42.160
<v Speaker 5>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean ultimately if I lose because my </v>

3726
02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:44.510
<v Speaker 5>diet wasn't good that day or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>the case may be,</v>

3727
02:38:44.511 --> 02:38:47.150
<v Speaker 5>I really just don't feel like I was that</v>
<v Speaker 5>good at Jujitsu to begin with.</v>

3728
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:52.270
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should be making improvements in </v>

3729
02:38:52.270 --> 02:38:52.270
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

3730
02:38:52.270 --> 02:38:52.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that I know.</v>

3731
02:38:52.270 --> 02:38:53.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's important,</v>

3732
02:38:53.001 --> 02:38:54.140
<v Speaker 5>but not for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not for.</v>

3733
02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:56.540
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to be the deciding factor</v>
<v Speaker 5>between me beating somebody.</v>

3734
02:38:56.541 --> 02:38:58.040
<v Speaker 5>You're not beating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

3735
02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:00.170
<v Speaker 5>That's just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense in some ways,</v>

3736
02:39:00.171 --> 02:39:05.171
<v Speaker 5>but in some ways it doesn't because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think about like you don't have the </v>

3737
02:39:05.171 --> 02:39:06.410
<v Speaker 5>ultimate optimal conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3738
02:39:06.411 --> 02:39:08.900
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the ultimate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always room for improvement,</v>

3739
02:39:08.901 --> 02:39:13.901
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always room for improvement in </v>

3740
02:39:13.901 --> 02:39:15.261
<v Speaker 5>your coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always room for improvement in </v>

3741
02:39:15.261 --> 02:39:15.261
<v Speaker 5>your technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those things.</v>

3742
02:39:15.261 --> 02:39:16.280
<v Speaker 5>There was room for improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How could it not be room for improvement</v>

3743
02:39:16.281 --> 02:39:18.380
<v Speaker 5>in your new tissue?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nutritional technique?</v>

3744
02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:19.760
<v Speaker 5>I what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What technique?</v>

3745
02:39:19.761 --> 02:39:24.761
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you fuel your body?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly is what do you use rooms or </v>

3746
02:39:24.761 --> 02:39:27.281
<v Speaker 5>improvement in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think there's like a </v>

3747
02:39:27.281 --> 02:39:28.090
<v Speaker 5>technique to giving yourself the right </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of carbohydrates,</v>

3748
02:39:28.170 --> 02:39:30.410
<v Speaker 5>certain amount of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a certain time.</v>

3749
02:39:30.470 --> 02:39:35.470
<v Speaker 5>It's a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's young and his body is crazy </v>

3750
02:39:35.470 --> 02:39:39.050
<v Speaker 5>metabolism and he's not being put in </v>
<v Speaker 5>positions where he's.</v>

3751
02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:44.160
<v Speaker 5>He's getting dragged out into deep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep waters and he's getting tired and </v>

3752
02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:44.160
<v Speaker 5>now it's the end.</v>

3753
02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:48.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like a 20 minute match minute 17 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's going against Marcello Garcia.</v>

3754
02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Then maybe that's where the Diet is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to come into play,</v>

3755
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:56.710
<v Speaker 5>but right now he's blowing through </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody so it doesn't matter if he'd </v>

3756
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720
<v Speaker 5>dig downs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

3757
02:39:56.721 --> 02:40:01.721
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't kind of make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Saying that a guy beats you wouldn't </v>

3758
02:40:01.721 --> 02:40:01.721
<v Speaker 5>have beaten you because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutritionally.</v>

3759
02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:03.440
<v Speaker 5>I think for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

3760
02:40:03.441 --> 02:40:03.920
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3761
02:40:03.921 --> 02:40:04.510
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3762
02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:06.350
<v Speaker 5>the chrome gracie fight like the end of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fight.</v>

3763
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:11.950
<v Speaker 5>Was it just his superior technique or </v>
<v Speaker 5>was it a combination of being exhausted </v>

3764
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:15.780
<v Speaker 5>and meet massive expenditure energy from</v>
<v Speaker 5>both parties and I was just in a really,</v>

3765
02:40:15.781 --> 02:40:16.920
<v Speaker 5>really bad spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3766
02:40:16.921 --> 02:40:18.870
<v Speaker 5>the guy had my back with like a body </v>
<v Speaker 5>triangle.</v>

3767
02:40:18.871 --> 02:40:22.470
<v Speaker 5>I stood up trying to last ditch efforts </v>
<v Speaker 5>to trying to defend the choke.</v>

3768
02:40:22.471 --> 02:40:23.670
<v Speaker 5>It had nothing to do with.</v>

3769
02:40:24.210 --> 02:40:26.850
<v Speaker 5>It had nothing to do with my </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditioning or anything like that.</v>

3770
02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:29.130
<v Speaker 5>Was I tired at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't even remember,</v>

3771
02:40:29.131 --> 02:40:34.131
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think I was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I was just in a really shitty </v>

3772
02:40:34.131 --> 02:40:37.311
<v Speaker 5>spot and that's why I ended up tapping </v>
<v Speaker 5>out because I thought I was about to go </v>

3773
02:40:37.311 --> 02:40:40.851
<v Speaker 5>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not because I was tired or </v>

3774
02:40:40.851 --> 02:40:40.851
<v Speaker 5>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I would have.</v>

3775
02:40:40.851 --> 02:40:44.930
<v Speaker 5>I think if you put me in the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation at a complete 100 percent </v>

3776
02:40:44.930 --> 02:40:48.171
<v Speaker 5>right before the match,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have gotten out any better </v>

3777
02:40:48.171 --> 02:40:48.171
<v Speaker 5>than I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're really.</v>

3778
02:40:48.171 --> 02:40:48.171
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3779
02:40:48.171 --> 02:40:48.520
<v Speaker 5>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3780
02:40:48.521 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree it makes a difference,</v>

3781
02:40:49.861 --> 02:40:54.861
<v Speaker 5>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that enough for you to </v>

3782
02:40:54.861 --> 02:40:54.861
<v Speaker 5>stop it from pizza and not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not too good.</v>

3783
02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Fired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3784
02:40:56.821 --> 02:41:01.140
<v Speaker 5>I felt better about myself if I had my </v>
<v Speaker 5>tons of money and like the ability to do</v>

3785
02:41:01.141 --> 02:41:01.830
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3786
02:41:01.831 --> 02:41:06.831
<v Speaker 5>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to hire somebody to follow me </v>

3787
02:41:06.831 --> 02:41:06.831
<v Speaker 5>around and feed me good shit all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

3788
02:41:06.831 --> 02:41:06.831
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>

3789
02:41:06.831 --> 02:41:11.640
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't want that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy would be annoying to have to </v>

3790
02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:11.640
<v Speaker 5>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3791
02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:13.950
<v Speaker 5>Telling me to get the fuck away from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pizza.</v>

3792
02:41:14.530 --> 02:41:16.620
<v Speaker 5>Know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey Man,</v>

3794
02:41:19.140 --> 02:41:24.140

<v Speaker 5>I think the human body is an amazing </v>

3795
02:41:24.871 --> 02:41:29.871
<v Speaker 5>thing to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that it takes pretty much </v>

3796
02:41:29.871 --> 02:41:31.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck you put inside of it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and turns it into what it needs.</v>

3797
02:41:31.141 --> 02:41:36.141
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was notorious for eating a </v>

3798
02:41:36.141 --> 02:41:36.141
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburger before every fucking games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Jordan.</v>

3799
02:41:36.141 --> 02:41:38.280
<v Speaker 5>That was like his ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would go to burger king or Mcdonald's</v>

3800
02:41:38.281 --> 02:41:43.281
<v Speaker 5>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you get a big Mac maybe to anybody </v>

<v Speaker 5>Michael motherfucking.</v>

3802
02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.800
<v Speaker 5>What'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about people we're </v>

3803
02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:49.800
<v Speaker 5>talking to bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

3807
02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:55.350
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To.</v>

3808
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to agree with this shit.</v>

3809
02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:59.670
<v Speaker 5>I was a Jordan Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Says,</v>

3810
02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:02.440
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pregame meal in 2001.</v>

3811
02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:04.370
<v Speaker 5>I've compensated for pride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrible.</v>

3812
02:42:04.371 --> 02:42:09.371
<v Speaker 5>Mark Kerr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I met him at the airport at Mcdonald's </v>

3813
02:42:09.371 --> 02:42:12.261
<v Speaker 5>and he was killing McDonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I video taped and everything just to </v>

3814
02:42:12.261 --> 02:42:12.261
<v Speaker 5>prove that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

3815
02:42:12.261 --> 02:42:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Look at this athlete eating this crap </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I have to keep proving to people</v>

3816
02:42:15.961 --> 02:42:18.420
<v Speaker 5>that it's Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that bad for you?</v>

3817
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:20.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely horrible.</v>

3818
02:42:20.850 --> 02:42:22.980
<v Speaker 5>I know it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it tastes so good.</v>

3819
02:42:23.690 --> 02:42:26.070
<v Speaker 5>Is it going to drastically affect my </v>
<v Speaker 5>athletic performance?</v>

3820
02:42:26.071 --> 02:42:30.300
<v Speaker 5>I was heated 10 seconds beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now every Friday my mom would take us to</v>

3821
02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:33.930
<v Speaker 5>Mcdonald's when she got paid on Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like a treat.</v>

3822
02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:36.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Raised as going to Mcdonald's.</v>

3823
02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:38.370
<v Speaker 5>This is what we've been waiting for all </v>
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>

3824
02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:40.910
<v Speaker 5>So this is so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3825
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:45.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or he ate the same meal before every </v>

3826
02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:46.020
<v Speaker 5>game of 23 on steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A baked potato and a ginger ale.</v>

3827
02:42:46.050 --> 02:42:47.550
<v Speaker 5>That's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big Difference.</v>

3828
02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:49.350
<v Speaker 5>That's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's healthy.</v>

3829
02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:50.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did I hear that?</v>

3830
02:42:50.611 --> 02:42:52.230
<v Speaker 5>It was a fucking cheeseburger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3831
02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 5>God Damn it.</v>

3832
02:42:53.791 --> 02:42:55.420
<v Speaker 5>Was that somebody else wants Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3833
02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:58.200
<v Speaker 5>so it was a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just those things they spread out.</v>

3834
02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:00.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3835
02:43:00.751 --> 02:43:04.260
<v Speaker 5>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is this like things that are just like,</v>

3836
02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.840
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wants punch Steve,</v>

3837
02:43:07.841 --> 02:43:08.580
<v Speaker 5>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve,</v>

3838
02:43:08.581 --> 02:43:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Kurt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the phase during practice.</v>

3839
02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 5>We don't need to see all</v>

3840
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>

3841
02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:17.840
<v Speaker 1>So forget what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to say is fucking dying.</v>

3842
02:43:17.890 --> 02:43:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Was gonna take that one back already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

3843
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Some people would take that and say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that.</v>

3844
02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:26.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not that good with the grass was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp.</v>

3845
02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:28.370
<v Speaker 1>It probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not,</v>

3846
02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a slightly higher grade of</v>
<v Speaker 1>beef.</v>

3847
02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:33.430
<v Speaker 1>What do you think Carl's junior burger </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that the natural burger.</v>

3848
02:43:33.431 --> 02:43:36.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a no steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no added hormones.</v>

3849
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be grass free,</v>

3850
02:43:37.331 --> 02:43:39.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grass fed or grass fed.</v>

3851
02:43:39.310 --> 02:43:40.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what a,</v>

3852
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:44.110
<v Speaker 1>what a piece of meat is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all these attachments to what it</v>

3853
02:43:44.111 --> 02:43:45.670
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's protein and water.</v>

3854
02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:48.460
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of like.</v>

3855
02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:54.260
<v Speaker 1>There's good aspects to some of the like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get healthier fats from grass fed </v>

3856
02:43:54.311 --> 02:43:56.830
<v Speaker 1>meat because you get a healthier animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely better for you.</v>

3857
02:43:56.830 --> 02:43:59.470
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more nutritionally dense </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

3858
02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:02.230
<v Speaker 1>but you could get by on like regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>Burgers,</v>

3859
02:44:02.350 --> 02:44:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you can get by on regular steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still human.</v>

3860
02:44:04.811 --> 02:44:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Body's an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3861
02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:11.200
<v Speaker 1>you school good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's taken that animal protein </v>

3862
02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:11.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's breaking it down and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making muscle with it.</v>

3863
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It just does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that it doesn't because </v>

3864
02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:17.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a steak and the stakes bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

3865
02:44:17.771 --> 02:44:19.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potatoes are good for you.</v>

3866
02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say a baked potato,</v>

<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

3870
02:44:27.481 --> 02:44:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more potassium in a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>potato than a banana.</v>

3871
02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's all healthy shit.</v>

3873
02:44:33.131 --> 02:44:36.160
<v Speaker 1>The people don't think that's healthy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are have an agenda.</v>

3874
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:38.050
<v Speaker 1>They're like either vegans or they.</v>

3875
02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:42.590
<v Speaker 1>They want to promote some really radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of nutrition knife.</v>

3876
02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:46.780
<v Speaker 1>My favorite comment on the Metamorph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premed Morris video was a gary.</v>

3877
02:44:46.781 --> 02:44:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Tony needs to stop eating cheeseburgers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and buy some proactive,</v>

3878
02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:53.030
<v Speaker 1>proactive like for visits or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3881
02:44:55.960 --> 02:45:00.380

<v Speaker 1>Do you fuck with that stuff for awhile?</v>

3882
02:45:00.430 --> 02:45:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>haven't had.</v>

3884
02:45:03.481 --> 02:45:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope is the best,</v>

3885
02:45:05.410 --> 02:45:06.250
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

3886
02:45:06.490 --> 02:45:08.880
<v Speaker 1>They just sent me a box of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

3887
02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I panic when I get low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used.</v>

3888
02:45:10.661 --> 02:45:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just such good soap too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that stuff that.</v>

3889
02:45:13.171 --> 02:45:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like a surgical scrub that you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit ain't good for you dude.</v>

3890
02:45:16.901 --> 02:45:17.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3891
02:45:17.651 --> 02:45:22.651
<v Speaker 1>That antibiotic soaps now good for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it kills your natural skin </v>

3892
02:45:22.651 --> 02:45:23.560
<v Speaker 1>flora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that they use for hospitals,</v>

3893
02:45:23.561 --> 02:45:24.580
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's intense.</v>

3894
02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:29.581
<v Speaker 1>Antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they try to deal with and use it </v>

3895
02:45:29.581 --> 02:45:29.581
<v Speaker 1>for my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because the and everything.</v>

3896
02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:33.040
<v Speaker 1>It might be causing the proactive work </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3897
02:45:35.250 --> 02:45:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I use it for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked out right?</v>

3898
02:45:37.710 --> 02:45:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes nothing works use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only use something for so long </v>

3899
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:44.210
<v Speaker 1>and it just gets fucking whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wash my face every once in a while.</v>

3900
02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a friend at work as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friar later cook.</v>

3901
02:45:46.901 --> 02:45:49.360
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker had the worst I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>

3902
02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:52.640
<v Speaker 1>A lot of tax environmental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're.</v>

3903
02:45:54.450 --> 02:45:56.860
<v Speaker 1>When you're famous for choking people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and breaking legs,</v>

3904
02:45:57.130 --> 02:45:58.600
<v Speaker 1>it don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you have zits.</v>

3905
02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Eddy brothers says it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't worry about just telling him </v>

3906
02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:03.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

3907
02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:03.900
<v Speaker 1>just keep winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan.</v>

3908
02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was gonna focus on and set</v>

3909
02:46:05.291 --> 02:46:07.840
<v Speaker 1>them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how it goes with Zits,</v>

3910
02:46:07.841 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but I know with your skin it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to not</v>

3911
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:15.110
<v Speaker 5>use the antibacterial soap and they also</v>
<v Speaker 5>say you shouldn't shower like any closer</v>

3912
02:46:15.111 --> 02:46:20.111
<v Speaker 5>than a half an hour before your match </v>
<v Speaker 5>because orbit before you train rather </v>

3913
02:46:20.111 --> 02:46:23.390
<v Speaker 5>because it takes your body time to </v>
<v Speaker 5>reestablish the skin for the antibodies.</v>

3914
02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:26.690
<v Speaker 5>Wrote a whole thing about that is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy who owns different soap.</v>

3915
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:29.610
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a whole thing about that on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>think it was on the undergraduate.</v>

3916
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:31.310
<v Speaker 5>Not supposed to take a shower before you</v>
<v Speaker 5>roll.</v>

3917
02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:32.960
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't put that out there.</v>

3918
02:46:32.961 --> 02:46:34.370
<v Speaker 5>Now people are going to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Snow.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>To use the smart dudes knowledge.</v>

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:35.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that was the number one moves,</v>

4005
02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:37.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4006
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:39.570
<v Speaker 5>our friend bud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4007
02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.760
<v Speaker 5>his mom has cancer and she's been taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannabis therapy for it and they </v>

4008
02:49:46.501 --> 02:49:48.150
<v Speaker 5>attributed to a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

4009
02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:53.360
<v Speaker 5>But one of them being that she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's stopped doing chemotherapy and </v>

4010
02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:58.270
<v Speaker 5>it's at the same time she started doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this cannabis and her tumor shrunk by </v>

4011
02:49:58.270 --> 02:49:59.640
<v Speaker 5>like 30 percent over a period of just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>few weeks.</v>

4012
02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:04.820
<v Speaker 5>They don't know if it was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>combination of the chemotherapy and the </v>

4013
02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:07.101
<v Speaker 5>cannabis oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they know that the cannabis oil has </v>

4014
02:50:07.101 --> 02:50:09.891
<v Speaker 5>a big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big effect on it and I've been talking </v>

4015
02:50:09.891 --> 02:50:12.291
<v Speaker 5>to so many people that know people with </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer that have also gone that route </v>

4016
02:50:12.291 --> 02:50:16.190
<v Speaker 5>and have started taking cannabis oil </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Rick Simpson oil and a bunch of </v>

4017
02:50:16.190 --> 02:50:17.250
<v Speaker 5>different cbd oils.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

4018
02:50:17.350 --> 02:50:22.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm hearing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see that vice documentary on the </v>

4019
02:50:22.350 --> 02:50:22.530
<v Speaker 5>measles virus and the HIV virus is </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible.</v>

4020
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:27.710
<v Speaker 5>They're using the measles virus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an HIV virus to kill cancer and it's so </v>

4021
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:29.880
<v Speaker 5>far it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety percent is amazing.</v>

4022
02:50:30.390 --> 02:50:35.390
<v Speaker 5>We live in good times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man decided to put that episode on </v>

4023
02:50:35.390 --> 02:50:39.081
<v Speaker 5>Youtube for free so that their gift to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world that's showing the progress </v>

4024
02:50:39.081 --> 02:50:40.950
<v Speaker 5>they've made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like they've cured cancer.</v>

4025
02:50:41.130 --> 02:50:42.180
<v Speaker 5>So it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4026
02:50:42.181 --> 02:50:47.181
<v Speaker 5>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are certainly making giant </v>

4027
02:50:47.181 --> 02:50:47.750
<v Speaker 5>leaps and bounds from where they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>just a decade ago.</v>

4028
02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:50.230
<v Speaker 5>Virus kills cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Crazy.</v>

4029
02:50:51.890 --> 02:50:53.740
<v Speaker 5>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4030
02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:59.390
<v Speaker 5>But you get really sick because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>take you through it and when they gave </v>

4031
02:50:59.390 --> 02:50:59.390
<v Speaker 5>him this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4032
02:50:59.390 --> 02:51:03.310
<v Speaker 5>this measles virus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get really go into comas and it </v>

4033
02:51:03.310 --> 02:51:07.641
<v Speaker 5>almost seems like they're going to die </v>
<v Speaker 5>but never are going to die anyways with </v>

4034
02:51:07.641 --> 02:51:10.551
<v Speaker 5>the cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they wake up from the coma and </v>

4035
02:51:10.551 --> 02:51:10.920
<v Speaker 5>then they're cancer free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my man as we live in crazy times.</v>

4036
02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:12.820
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think that.</v>

4037
02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:14.370
<v Speaker 5>This is the last question because we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost out of time,</v>

4038
02:51:14.371 --> 02:51:14.700
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4039
02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Five of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five minutes left.</v>

4040
02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:21.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think about performance </v>

4041
02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.571
<v Speaker 5>enhancing drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that is a big issue with </v>

4042
02:51:23.571 --> 02:51:23.571
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4043
02:51:23.571 --> 02:51:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Steve Maxwell was just raving about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other day.</v>

4044
02:51:24.511 --> 02:51:25.940
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need to do that in Jujitsu.</v>

4045
02:51:25.950 --> 02:51:27.470
<v Speaker 5>There's too many guys that are on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>news.</v>

4046
02:51:27.690 --> 02:51:28.910
<v Speaker 5>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4047
02:51:28.911 --> 02:51:31.710
<v Speaker 5>because it's not in any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4048
02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:34.590
<v Speaker 5>they have some light testing that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>do for ib ggf,</v>

4049
02:51:34.591 --> 02:51:37.500
<v Speaker 5>but it's like one of those situations </v>
<v Speaker 5>again where like people know what to do,</v>

4050
02:51:37.501 --> 02:51:42.501
<v Speaker 5>like they have enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have advanced notice of the event </v>

4051
02:51:42.501 --> 02:51:42.501
<v Speaker 5>coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know if they could be tested,</v>

4052
02:51:42.501 --> 02:51:45.810
<v Speaker 5>whatever they pay after the event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is after the event?</v>

4053
02:51:45.811 --> 02:51:46.840
<v Speaker 5>Is it urine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4054
02:51:46.841 --> 02:51:49.320
<v Speaker 5>they test the randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 10 dudes or something like that.</v>

4055
02:51:49.350 --> 02:51:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

4056
02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:51.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something stupid.</v>

4057
02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:54.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a step in a direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

4058
02:51:54.210 --> 02:51:56.580
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's clearly a rampant um,</v>

4059
02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:58.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as to what to do about it.</v>

4060
02:51:59.070 --> 02:52:01.980
<v Speaker 5>Like you either need to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's only two routes.</v>

4061
02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:04.380
<v Speaker 5>There's one you just don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4062
02:52:04.381 --> 02:52:07.120
<v Speaker 5>And then everybody has their option to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use it or not use it,</v>

4063
02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:08.100
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4064
02:52:08.170 --> 02:52:08.970
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4065
02:52:08.971 --> 02:52:10.800
<v Speaker 5>you're obviously the people that choose </v>
<v Speaker 5>not to,</v>

4066
02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:13.690
<v Speaker 5>are going to suffer in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>disadvantage of not the strength.</v>

4067
02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:18.190
<v Speaker 5>And then the other way to go about is </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to do it fucking right and just</v>

4068
02:52:18.191 --> 02:52:23.191
<v Speaker 5>have random testing all the time and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a way where people can't fucking cheat </v>

4069
02:52:23.191 --> 02:52:23.191
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

4070
02:52:23.191 --> 02:52:24.760
<v Speaker 5>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if some camps get really,</v>

4071
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:27.040
<v Speaker 5>which is what happens in Oma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some camps get really,</v>

4072
02:52:27.041 --> 02:52:30.250
<v Speaker 5>really good at figuring out what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways are to cheat the tests or this,</v>

4073
02:52:30.251 --> 02:52:31.060
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the other thing.</v>

4074
02:52:31.270 --> 02:52:33.670
<v Speaker 5>And then other guys aren't gonna fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>go through that.</v>

4075
02:52:33.671 --> 02:52:36.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean he gives those guys an advantage </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the other guys that aren't,</v>

4076
02:52:36.730 --> 02:52:38.230
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

4077
02:52:38.350 --> 02:52:39.430
<v Speaker 5>So it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4078
02:52:39.790 --> 02:52:42.550
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in a perfect world that's like,</v>

4079
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:43.600
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get rid of it.</v>

4080
02:52:43.601 --> 02:52:48.601
<v Speaker 5>But it just seems like there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always a way to fucking hide it </v>

4081
02:52:48.601 --> 02:52:51.990
<v Speaker 5>or always a way to do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm just gonna keep trying to get </v>

4082
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:54.721
<v Speaker 5>better at Jujitsu and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hopefully that saves me instead of </v>

4083
02:52:54.721 --> 02:52:54.721
<v Speaker 5>bolting biceps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll see.</v>

4084
02:52:54.721 --> 02:52:55.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've also seen a bunch of guys who were</v>

4085
02:52:55.241 --> 02:53:00.241
<v Speaker 5>just two guys that got into mma and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>got caught when they got into mma </v>

4086
02:53:00.241 --> 02:53:01.660
<v Speaker 5>because then they get tested a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit more thoroughly and assurance out.</v>

4087
02:53:01.661 --> 02:53:03.610
<v Speaker 5>They were probably using it the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

4088
02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:04.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's tons.</v>

4089
02:53:04.930 --> 02:53:06.070
<v Speaker 5>There's tons of that for sure.</v>

4090
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4091
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:08.590
<v Speaker 5>whatever the case may be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4092
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:11.800
<v Speaker 5>you think about this situation that MMA </v>
<v Speaker 5>finds itself in.</v>

4093
02:53:11.801 --> 02:53:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Right now I'm looking at an MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4094
02:53:13.691 --> 02:53:15.310
<v Speaker 5>as a future prospect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4095
02:53:15.340 --> 02:53:17.590
<v Speaker 5>getting involved in and you see all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4096
02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:19.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these guys are testing positive.</v>

4097
02:53:19.751 --> 02:53:24.751
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something that Ronda Rousey said was </v>

4098
02:53:24.751 --> 02:53:24.751
<v Speaker 5>kind of interesting about the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4099
02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:26.320
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't like baseball wherever,</v>

4100
02:53:26.321 --> 02:53:31.321
<v Speaker 5>using steroids to hit a ball harder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're using steroids and people are </v>

4101
02:53:31.321 --> 02:53:33.160
<v Speaker 5>fucking getting knocked the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

4102
02:53:33.161 --> 02:53:34.270
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's scary,</v>

4103
02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:39.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in a sense that people are getting </v>

4104
02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:39.880
<v Speaker 5>stronger and stronger and have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to do serious damage to people,</v>

4105
02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:41.500
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in that sense,</v>

4106
02:53:41.501 --> 02:53:41.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4107
02:53:41.891 --> 02:53:43.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a martial art,</v>

4108
02:53:43.031 --> 02:53:44.680
<v Speaker 5>I think that's super dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4109
02:53:44.681 --> 02:53:45.700
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4110
02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:48.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the answer is,</v>

4111
02:53:48.190 --> 02:53:53.190
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean in terms of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they should do or whatever the case may </v>

4112
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.410
<v Speaker 5>be with a pds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just because there's,</v>

4113
02:53:53.470 --> 02:53:54.670
<v Speaker 5>and it's not even just steroids.</v>

4114
02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:58.030
<v Speaker 5>There's tons of other stuff people can </v>
<v Speaker 5>be taken dpos and all different kinds of</v>

4115
02:53:58.031 --> 02:53:58.570
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

4116
02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:03.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was an article recently online </v>

4117
02:54:03.660 --> 02:54:05.341
<v Speaker 5>where there were saying that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>businessmen is middle aged businessmen </v>

4118
02:54:05.341 --> 02:54:07.540
<v Speaker 5>have taken epo and winning cycling races</v>
<v Speaker 5>just entering into amateur cycling races</v>

4119
02:54:07.541 --> 02:54:09.530
<v Speaker 5>on Epo and winning them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>

4120
02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:14.540
<v Speaker 5>it just gives just such a giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantage when you're dealing with </v>

4121
02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:14.890
<v Speaker 5>someone who has some cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are cycling,</v>

4122
02:54:14.891 --> 02:54:18.030
<v Speaker 5>so you have the muscle strength and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden you have this superhuman</v>

4123
02:54:18.130 --> 02:54:19.110
<v Speaker 5>endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4124
02:54:19.690 --> 02:54:21.190
<v Speaker 5>So this is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucked.</v>

4125
02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:26.280
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird that it's so many mma </v>

4126
02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:26.280
<v Speaker 5>fighters are testing positive for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

4127
02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:29.670
<v Speaker 5>The epl world of Ali Baba routine off </v>
<v Speaker 5>who fought for the title again.</v>

4128
02:54:29.671 --> 02:54:30.790
<v Speaker 5>So my name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mouse Johnson,</v>

4129
02:54:31.180 --> 02:54:36.180
<v Speaker 5>he tested positive for EPO.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shane Mosley tested positive for evo </v>

4130
02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:38.020
<v Speaker 5>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you think that's really,</v>

4131
02:54:38.021 --> 02:54:38.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd say,</v>

4132
02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:44.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean people always say a large </v>
<v Speaker 5>percentage of professional athletes are </v>

4133
02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:48.271
<v Speaker 5>on steroids that Duh Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think a large percentage of our </v>

4134
02:54:48.271 --> 02:54:51.581
<v Speaker 5>on epl as well because cardio so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know of many that have been on epo.</v>

4135
02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:57.420
<v Speaker 5>I know of many that were on epo back in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the day at least I know from the </v>

4136
02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.680
<v Speaker 5>anecdotal stories that I've heard from </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that trained with them that there</v>

4137
02:54:59.681 --> 02:55:03.010
<v Speaker 5>was guys will take a wild west shoot epo</v>
<v Speaker 5>or eat it.</v>

4138
02:55:03.050 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 5>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

4139
02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:05.930
<v Speaker 1>they have a pill form now though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4140
02:55:05.931 --> 02:55:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be wrong about that,</v>

4141
02:55:07.701 --> 02:55:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've made major advances so they used</v>

4142
02:55:10.281 --> 02:55:12.980
<v Speaker 1>to have to do like blood transfusions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do it properly.</v>

4143
02:55:13.010 --> 02:55:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's still guys.</v>

4144
02:55:14.211 --> 02:55:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that blood dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they do that because there's no</v>

4145
02:55:17.331 --> 02:55:20.000
<v Speaker 1>test for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take your own blood out of your</v>

4146
02:55:20.001 --> 02:55:21.380
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make weight,</v>

4147
02:55:21.530 --> 02:55:25.370
<v Speaker 1>your body has that blood regenerated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and then you add more blood to</v>

4148
02:55:25.371 --> 02:55:30.371
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have more oxygen carrying </v>

4149
02:55:30.371 --> 02:55:32.171
<v Speaker 1>capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take two weeks though for your body to </v>

4150
02:55:32.171 --> 02:55:32.171
<v Speaker 1>make that blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

4151
02:55:32.171 --> 02:55:37.001
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guys could easily get a blood </v>

4152
02:55:37.001 --> 02:55:37.700
<v Speaker 1>transfusion two weeks out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>

4153
02:55:37.701 --> 02:55:40.670
<v Speaker 1>that would give you plenty of time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover if you want it to do that.</v>

4154
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:42.710
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take Saturday and Sunday off,</v>

4155
02:55:43.010 --> 02:55:44.630
<v Speaker 1>you know you train all week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just say,</v>

4156
02:55:44.631 --> 02:55:49.631
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get a blood transfusion </v>

4157
02:55:49.631 --> 02:55:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Friday or a blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a withdrawal,</v>

4158
02:55:49.631 --> 02:55:50.300
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take my blood out </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>

4159
02:55:50.510 --> 02:55:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you know you have the weekend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

4160
02:55:51.981 --> 02:55:56.981
<v Speaker 1>You go back on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start training again and then they </v>

4161
02:55:56.981 --> 02:55:57.980
<v Speaker 1>hold onto that blood for two weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then Jack that shit back in your system.</v>

4162
02:55:57.981 --> 02:56:02.981
<v Speaker 1>You would most certainly have some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a performance advantage from that and</v>

4163
02:56:03.021 --> 02:56:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can detect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

4164
02:56:05.890 --> 02:56:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what the bikers used to do.</v>

4165
02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.430
<v Speaker 1>That was with all the cyclists used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

4166
02:56:09.431 --> 02:56:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4167
02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating time where people are</v>

4168
02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:18.080
<v Speaker 1>learning more and more about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat and then how to stop cheating.</v>

4169
02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:20.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the shit that had hector lumbar got</v>

4170
02:56:20.601 --> 02:56:21.140
<v Speaker 1>caught for.</v>

4171
02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She designer steroid.</v>

4172
02:56:23.691 --> 02:56:28.691
<v Speaker 1>That was like really expensive exotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that it was that clear stuff that </v>

4173
02:56:28.691 --> 02:56:33.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm very bonds and the victor connotate </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff where they thought that nobody </v>

4174
02:56:33.521 --> 02:56:34.160
<v Speaker 1>knew how to detect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4175
02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strictly.</v>

4176
02:56:36.970 --> 02:56:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a very tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Rhonda is point is as valid as fuck.</v>

4177
02:56:40.180 --> 02:56:45.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're landing punches that you </v>

4178
02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:45.180
<v Speaker 1>probably wouldn't be able to land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing damage,</v>

4179
02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a war where one person surges </v>

4180
02:56:49.930 --> 02:56:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and comes on at the end and stops that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

4181
02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:54.170
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a big part of it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking chaos.</v>

4210
02:58:07.530 --> 02:58:09.570
<v Speaker 1>The $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand prize.</v>

4211
02:58:09.890 --> 02:58:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I dare anyone to watch this and tell me </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not exciting.</v>

4212
02:58:13.471 --> 02:58:14.850
<v Speaker 1>This is some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

4213
02:58:14.851 --> 02:58:17.520
<v Speaker 1>this is all about all about encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 1>urgency.</v>

4214
02:58:17.521 --> 02:58:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So what I did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is winner take all.</v>

4215
02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a game show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else gets paid,</v>

4216
02:58:22.801 --> 02:58:26.130
<v Speaker 1>just a winner to ensure urgency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>each.</v>

4217
02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:29.430
<v Speaker 1>So the winner has to win four matches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he only gets paid on the matches.</v>

4218
02:58:29.431 --> 02:58:32.250
<v Speaker 1>He winds and regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's $2,500</v>

4219
02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:37.340
<v Speaker 1>per match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a possible 10 grand that he </v>

4220
02:58:37.340 --> 02:58:40.341
<v Speaker 1>could win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is only gonna get bigger and </v>

4221
02:58:40.341 --> 02:58:40.341
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go 50 grand.</v>

4222
02:58:40.341 --> 02:58:40.920
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go under grant eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million.</v>
