8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit out there when it comes to a razors that people are,</v>

9
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

11
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sell you on and promote.</v>

13
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of nonsense.</v>

14
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.011
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

15
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>we need a sharp blade that cuts the fucking hair on your face and all this other</v>

17
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>vibrating text messaging.</v>

18
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous for a razor.</v>

19
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.943
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that.</v>

20
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if your razors really did text messaging.</v>

21
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.701
<v Speaker 1>It's probably happening.</v>

22
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It's on the way someone's probably working on right now and they listened to</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

28

<v Speaker 1>but wipes from men.</v>

41
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they have to be for men,</v>

42
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>like of a chick comes over your house and uses,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but wipe Charlies.</v>

44
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>He said one of those weird things like when a chick uses your deodorant,</v>

45
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I think they need more like a bigger light,</v>

46
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>so that's why their dues have bigger bottle.</v>

47
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Xbox and w in the time that it takes you to respond after you get</v>

<v Speaker 2>while shaving.</v>

00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:19.721
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

80
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Mr Antonopoulos.</v>

81
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>If you've been thinking about starting your own business,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can incorporate and form an LLC.</v>

83
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 2>You could do it at legal zoom and you could form an LLC starting at 99 bucks.</v>

86
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Nine out of 10 customers who have used legal zoom would recommend the service to</v>

87
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>their friends and family.</v>

88
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>That is huge.</v>

89
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what else is huge?</v>

90
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>They got an a plus from the better business.</v>

91
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Pure.</v>

92
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 2>That's double huge so that way you got to huges because like nine out of 10</v>

93
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:56.621
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

94
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:56.861
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

95
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.694
<v Speaker 2>who did they ask?</v>

96
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.121
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

97
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>you know they say half the people say that the earth is less than 10,000 years</v>

98
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

99
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Half the people in this country believe in the biblical version of the Bible.</v>

100
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.681
<v Speaker 2>It's like 40 something a high 40 over 46% shocking but not really.</v>

101
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>When you consider the fact that 100% of all people who answer surveys are</v>

102
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.573
<v Speaker 2>idiots,</v>

103
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 2>so half of the idiots think the earth is 10,000 years old,</v>

104
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 2>but for real legit.</v>

105
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.500

<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

109
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 2>That only exists if a company is good,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a guy in a,</v>

145
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's in Idaho now,</v>

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 2>has the Joe rogan.com</v>

147
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I actually liked it that he has it now because I just know he was,</v>

148
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 2>he was so douchey about it when I wanted to buy it and I'm glad I never did</v>

149
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

150

<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say douchey.</v>

154
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>He recognized the value of it and he was playing hardball with me.</v>

155
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

156
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:05.301
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way.</v>

157
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It was smart on his side.</v>

158
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 1>He would say I'm Douchey Shit.</v>

159
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>All the fucking emails that he probably gets from people.</v>

160
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.411
<v Speaker 1>Black holes and stuff.</v>

161

164
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.751
<v Speaker 1>other than me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a close second.</v>

167

<v Speaker 1>Do you get a lot of plaques every now and then?</v>

168
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then in the early days of the podcast when we would bring up black</v>

169
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:27.531
<v Speaker 1>hawks,</v>

170

171
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>There was something that was wrong.</v>

172
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what we're talking about.</v>

173
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Black Hawks are just,</v>

174
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>we started talking about that.</v>

175
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>We're also brought to you by on at.com.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of new and fabulous shit like,</v>

180
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>the warrior bar,</v>

182
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:49.481
<v Speaker 1>which is our new protein bar that is made from organic buffalo meat with no</v>

183
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics,</v>

184
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>no hormones.</v>

185
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>It is gluten free with no nitrates.</v>

186
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>It is also no MSG,</v>

187
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.091
<v Speaker 1>no soy,</v>

188
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 1>no lactose.</v>

189
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And it is 14 grams of protein in each serving with only four grams of fat and</v>

190
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.684
<v Speaker 1>it's healthy fat.</v>

191
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Does it help?</v>

192
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Bisons are very healthy animals.</v>

193
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo there,</v>

194
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.623
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

196
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>there's very few wild buffalo these days,</v>

197
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately because our great ancestors,</v>

198
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.431
<v Speaker 1>not mine,</v>

199
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>but yours.</v>

200
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>There were cons.</v>

201
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Mine came from Italy and Ireland.</v>

202
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>They had no part in the buffalo slang.</v>

203
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>They came here during the 20th century.</v>

204
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.861
<v Speaker 1>But for,</v>

205
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:28.694
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

206
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the people that,</v>

207
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.200
<v Speaker 1>did wipe out the Buffalo Buffalo's are an incredibly healthy and powerful</v>

209
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

210
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>They killed a fuck load of them,</v>

211
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>but they saved a lot of them too.</v>

212
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people think that buffaloes are extinct.</v>

213
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not in Texas.</v>

214
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:43.041
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

215
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:43.431
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

216
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

217
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you can find them at a lot of,</v>

218
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

219
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 1>private hunting ranches.</v>

220
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>They have buffaloes and they have a lot of these buffalo farms.</v>

221
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the best high protein meats that you can get it.</v>

222
00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 1>There is such a crazy animal too.</v>

223
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge fucking what a,</v>

224
00:07:58.521 --> 00:07:58.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

225
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>what an amazing animal to perfect animal really to represent the wild west.</v>

226
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It's big giant wild cow with a lion's mane,</v>

227
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.413
<v Speaker 1>they're so cool.</v>

229
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

230
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>they're yummy and delicious and we sell their meat at on it.</v>

231
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 1>We also have,</v>

232
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:14.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

233
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>a wide variety of other healthy foods like organic coconut oil,</v>

234
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>which is super healthy for you as well.</v>

235
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Hemp protein powder and we have a new supplement called earth grown nutrients</v>

236
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>with earth grow nutrients is,</v>

237
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a combination of,</v>

238
00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

239
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>several different greens,</v>

240
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>things that are like super healthy for you and you can add it to protein powers</v>

241
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>and it just gives you a little extra boost of nutrients if you're covers your</v>

242
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>bases as it were.</v>

243
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're not really totally diligent about your diet or if you're a busy person</v>

244
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:52.151
<v Speaker 1>and you do not have the time to eat many servings of fruits and vegetables a</v>

245
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

246
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you can cover a lot of that with a,</v>

247
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>a good nutrient blend.</v>

248
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>The best way is to get things that come from actual whole foods.</v>

249
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

250
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>your body can process synthetic vitamins,</v>

251
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>but for sure they're not going to process them as well as actual nutrients that</v>

252
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>come from food itself.</v>

253
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And what we use is a combination of,</v>

254
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:14.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>essentially what we do with everything else.</v>

256
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 1>We just get the best nutritious things that we can find the best strength and</v>

257
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>conditioning equipment we can find.</v>

258
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And with this earth grown nutrients,</v>

259
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of really exotic ingredients like Peruvian purple corn,</v>

260
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.810
<v Speaker 1>which is high in antioxidants,</v>

261
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Asai uh,</v>

262
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other grapes,</v>

263
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.421
<v Speaker 1>grapes,</v>

264
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:36.254
<v Speaker 1>Skins,</v>

265
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Camou I don't know what that is.</v>

266
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>So these are really potent antioxidants.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's how I use it,</v>

308
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.101
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>

309
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:32.641
<v Speaker 1>maces,</v>

310
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 1>steel clubs,</v>

311
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.741
<v Speaker 1>ab wheels,</v>

312
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:35.521
<v Speaker 1>medicine balls,</v>

313
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 1>we just fought.</v>

314
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Who makes the best equipment,</v>

315
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>buy it from them.</v>

316
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.623
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to do it.</v>

317
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Battle ropes.</v>

318
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And we also have kettle bells that we've designed and made ourselves these</v>

319
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Zombie bells and the primal bells.</v>

320
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Those are artistic kettle bells that are also functional.</v>

321
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 1>They're three d designed,</v>

322
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>the three d graft them,</v>

323
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

324
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that they're balanced though,</v>

325
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Speaker 1>so that they're not just cool looking,</v>

326
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually functional.</v>

327
00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:57.541
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

328
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

329
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>do the kettlebell swings,</v>

330
00:10:58.951 --> 00:10:59.151
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

331
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>they're not like off kilter.</v>

332
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>What's steel belts?</v>

333
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Steel belts are these bags that are filled with,</v>

334
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:04.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

335
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>these little tiny,</v>

336
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

337
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.370
<v Speaker 1>steel pellets and their,</v>

338
00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 1>their heaviest shit.</v>

339
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And you pick them up and you toss them around and throw them.</v>

340
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Really what you should do is get a fucking job,</v>

341
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

342
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.364
<v Speaker 1>farm,</v>

343
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

344
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>and work doing that all day.</v>

345
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>He'd be strong as shit.</v>

346
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You ever tried to arm wrestle at farmer?</v>

347
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 1>They will fuck you up.</v>

348
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.350
<v Speaker 1>That Joel Salitan guy that we had on the podcast,</v>

349
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I bet that old man would fuck me up.</v>

350
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I bet if we arm wrestle,</v>

351
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.100
<v Speaker 1>but I kicked my ass.</v>

352
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>They throw hay bales around all day and shit.</v>

353
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have time for Hay Bales,</v>

354
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.061
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

355
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

356
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.290
<v Speaker 1>get it all done.</v>

357
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

358
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:31.981
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

359
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:32.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

360
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:32.521
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

361
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Onnit steel bells.</v>

363
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of the medicine balls.</v>

364
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I've really only worked out with the primal steel belt once and that was when I</v>

365
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:40.524
<v Speaker 1>was at on it,</v>

366
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but I could see a big benefit in it.</v>

367
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It's also awkward to pick up,</v>

368
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:44.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 1>when you're picking up one of these things,</v>

370
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not like picking up a weight shifts and moves around.</v>

371
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that it sort of mimics real work.</v>

372
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's good for like a conditioning workout as you want to do something that</v>

373
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>really like ups,</v>

374
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you're a ups your cardio,</v>

375
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>just pick this up and slamming on the ground like 150 times you'd be fucking</v>

376
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>exhausted and a bunch of different exercises that you can find with these things</v>

377
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>to really,</v>

378
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

379
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda cool.</v>

380
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

381
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

382
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>we have a video of a bunch of them,</v>

383
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

384
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.310
<v Speaker 1>at on it and we also have a,</v>

385
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 1>a workout section at on it that you can go to for all the different,</v>

386
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

387
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:19.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

388
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:22.380
<v Speaker 1>workout equipment like the steel bells,</v>

389
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>w kettlebells.</v>

390
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>We have a new video that Aubrey and I did where we were talking about our</v>

391
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 1>favorite exercises show,</v>

392
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>some alternating cleans and a bunch of different things.</v>

393
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:33.670
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put these out as as much as possible.</v>

394
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

395
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 1>one important point though,</v>

396
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to do anything like this,</v>

397
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't done it,</v>

398
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a background in strength and conditioning,</v>

399
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a background in exercise,</v>

400
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 1>police start slowly concentrating on the proper form.</v>

401
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 1>If you can film yourself and compare yourself to the way other people are doing</v>

402
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it in videos to make sure that you're doing it correctly,</v>

403
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>if you really can,</v>

404
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:58.870
<v Speaker 1>the the really the best move is to get a trainer.</v>

405
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Get someone who can even just for one workout,</v>

406
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>show you how to do it correctly so that you're not fucking yourself up.</v>

407
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.190
<v Speaker 1>You can work out safe and and efficiently with this stuff,</v>

408
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Speaker 1>but you really want to make sure that you do it correctly.</v>

409
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>To do so.</v>

410
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.701

00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:46.160
<v Speaker 3>It was fun having you on before and a lot of feedback.</v>

426
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.570
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people learned a lot about crypto currencies and the benefits of them,</v>

427
00:13:50.571 --> 00:13:51.590
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>

429
00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:56.360
<v Speaker 3>the pushes where the negative things are and put a little balance to a lot of</v>

430
00:13:56.361 --> 00:13:59.780
<v Speaker 3>the negative press that you hear about bitcoin and all these different various</v>

431
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 3>cryptocurrencies in the media because that's literally all I hear.</v>

432
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

433
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

434
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I know people are trading things back and forth,</v>

435
00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:09.320
<v Speaker 3>but you really put it into perspective for us,</v>

436
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.820
<v Speaker 3>especially when you were talking about that what was $150 million transaction as</v>

437
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:15.920
<v Speaker 3>I was the one that was done through bitcoin.</v>

438
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.080
<v Speaker 3>When you start hearing things like that,</v>

439
00:14:18.081 --> 00:14:18.291
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

440
00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:18.950
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

441
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.180
<v Speaker 3>well there's some people out there that have some serious fucking money and</v>

442
00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:24.440
<v Speaker 3>they're banking on this.</v>

443
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.260
<v Speaker 3>They're throwing their chips in this corner,</v>

444
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.450
<v Speaker 3>at least some of them to see what's going on.</v>

445
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.830
<v Speaker 3>And I guess the idea is if it's worth $150 million today,</v>

446
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.890
<v Speaker 3>who fucking knows what it would be worth in five years?</v>

447
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.970
<v Speaker 3>That's the big gamble,</v>

448
00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

449
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

450
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:39.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

451
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:39.551
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

452
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:39.980
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

453
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

454
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.700
<v Speaker 5>I think it's important not to look at it as an investment.</v>

455
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.063
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

456
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.320
<v Speaker 5>it's so much more interesting as a means of exchange than as a store of value.</v>

457
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.673
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

458
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 5>it can do amazing things</v>

459
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 6>in terms of velocity,</v>

460
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 6>just getting money from one place to another,</v>

461
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 6>and it's not about the big movements.</v>

462
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 6>What's even more fascinating as the small moments?</v>

463
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.134
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>

464
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 6>I take tips on Twitter and without knowing these people,</v>

465
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 6>they can send me a quarter,</v>

466
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 6>like 25 cents or 10 cents over Twitter instantly.</v>

467
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 6>And you can't even do that with any other payments system because it costs so</v>

468
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 6>much to move money.</v>

469
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 6>And it enables all of these little tiny,</v>

470
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 6>tiny transactions,</v>

471
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

472
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:20.803
<v Speaker 6>and they add up,</v>

473
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.460
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

474
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

475
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 6>and it's fun to,</v>

476
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 6>to be able to connect with people that way.</v>

477
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's direct unlike say like a paypal situation where you have to give them a</v>

478
00:15:28.811 --> 00:15:29.710
<v Speaker 1>piece of the action.</v>

479
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:30.431
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

480
00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:30.971
<v Speaker 6>Not just that.</v>

481
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:31.320
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

482
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.330
<v Speaker 6>it requires no prior arrangements of any kind.</v>

483
00:15:34.331 --> 00:15:36.010
<v Speaker 6>They don't need to create an account.</v>

484
00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:37.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't need to create an account.</v>

485
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:39.820
<v Speaker 6>I can just put up my bitcoin address as harvest saving things.</v>

486
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Now if you pay taxes on Bitcoin,</v>

487
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:42.401
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

488
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:42.821
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>

489
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:43.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

490
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:45.520
<v Speaker 1>how do you sort it out over the course of a year?</v>

491
00:15:45.521 --> 00:15:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>

492
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

493
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the dollar value of it goes up and down.</v>

494
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

495
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.060
<v Speaker 1>So how do you figure out,</v>

496
00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:53.200
<v Speaker 1>like when you make taxes,</v>

497
00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:55.060
<v Speaker 1>do you do it at the current rate,</v>

498
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the day you file it?</v>

499
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

500
00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:57.904
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

501
00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:58.960
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

502
00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.291
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

503
00:15:59.291 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

504
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.131
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

505
00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:01.510
<v Speaker 6>we're still trying to figure that out.</v>

506
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.870
<v Speaker 6>It's been about a month since the IRS released some information on how they want</v>

507
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:07.691
<v Speaker 6>to tax it.</v>

508
00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:09.130
<v Speaker 6>Then they were taxing it like a commodity,</v>

509
00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:10.330
<v Speaker 6>which means capital gains.</v>

510
00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:11.020
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

511
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.380
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

512
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.230
<v Speaker 6>you have to account for the price when you bought it and then the price when you</v>

513
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:16.360
<v Speaker 6>sold it and then look at the difference.</v>

514
00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:17.230
<v Speaker 6>And if you gained you,</v>

515
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.300
<v Speaker 6>you pay tax on capital gains tax on the,</v>

516
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.193
<v Speaker 6>and if you lost you,</v>

517
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.150
<v Speaker 6>you can account for capital losses.</v>

518
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.370
<v Speaker 1>That seems like if people were smart,</v>

519
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 1>they would buy up a shit load of Bitcoin,</v>

520
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.790
<v Speaker 1>then sell like right before and fucking crash the market and then pay their</v>

521
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:34.570
<v Speaker 1>taxes and then buy and then you'd fucking just keep winning.</v>

522
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:34.981
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

523
00:16:34.981 --> 00:16:38.160
<v Speaker 6>The market's big enough that you can't really play those kinds of games.</v>

524
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.010
<v Speaker 6>Dude always think it's going to get complicated.</v>

525
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that a possibility?</v>

526
00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Could you do that?</v>

527
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And did I just violate the law?</v>

528
00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:47.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

529
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.500
<v Speaker 1>the insider trading never confused</v>

530
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

531
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.953
<v Speaker 6>the markets,</v>

532
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 6>the markets pretty huge right now.</v>

533
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:54.194
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>

534
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 6>on a daily basis,</v>

535
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

536
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 6>tens of thousands of big coin move around.</v>

537
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 6>So unless you were able to bring a very big amount of air,</v>

538
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 6>you can't really do that.</v>

539
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:05.780
<v Speaker 6>You can't move these markets artificially.</v>

540
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to be like some Bill Gates type character to do that and,</v>

541
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

542
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 6>it would be difficult.</v>

543
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 6>There are far more liquid markets to do that.</v>

544
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:13.941
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

545
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:14.950
<v Speaker 6>if you want to play games like that,</v>

546
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 6>go play them on s and s and p 500 with front running,</v>

547
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:18.950
<v Speaker 6>high frequency trading.</v>

548
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.121
<v Speaker 6>That's what's going on.</v>

549
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 6>That's where the big games are being played.</v>

550
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 6>This is small stuff.</v>

551
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.600
<v Speaker 1>They have to make the stock market illegal.</v>

552
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 1>They really do the shits.</v>

553
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.180
<v Speaker 1>You've got a good point too about saying that it's important to not look at it</v>

555
00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:34.620
<v Speaker 1>as an investment because there's some kind of gross about those kinds of</v>

556
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:35.454
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>

557
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Like when you find out about somebody got in on a stock early,</v>

558
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.040
<v Speaker 1>like some tech company and then it may like 300 million bucks,</v>

559
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.450
<v Speaker 1>like for no fucking reason.</v>

560
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.261
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>

561
00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:44.094
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

562
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.403
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do?</v>

563
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Where's that money coming from?</v>

564
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

565
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 6>It's way too volatile.</v>

566
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

567
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.920
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

568
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a growing technology.</v>

569
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a brand new technology is still being tested.</v>

570
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>It's way too volatile.</v>

571
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And for the average investor,</v>

572
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>that means it's way too risky.</v>

573
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Now there are some investors,</v>

574
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated investors who have a broad portfolio and who may want to take a</v>

575
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:10.521
<v Speaker 1>small part of that portfolio and put it into a very high volatility investment</v>

576
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>in order to churn some returns out.</v>

577
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 1>But they would do that's in a very,</v>

578
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:15.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

579
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.390
<v Speaker 1>knowing exactly how much risk they're taking,</v>

580
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot and balancing out that risk over big afford a folio.</v>

581
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>But your average person,</v>

582
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.111
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

583
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:27.750
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely not the kind of thing you want to be playing with.</v>

584
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Use it to do transactions,</v>

585
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.530
<v Speaker 1>hold it for long term playing with this market will only get you burned.</v>

586
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.151
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>

587
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 1>there's this real temptation to try to day trade this market.</v>

588
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.011
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

589
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people fall for that temptation.</v>

590
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I played with it when I first started with bitcoin.</v>

591
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It was learned that lesson pretty fast.</v>

592
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.600
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

593
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.770
<v Speaker 1>if you're day trading,</v>

594
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.001
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

595
00:18:52.001 --> 00:18:53.080
<v Speaker 1>How would you work that out?</v>

596
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 1>You would say you'd buy up a bunch of bitcoin and then when the price hit a</v>

597
00:18:58.201 --> 00:18:59.890
<v Speaker 1>significant margin,</v>

598
00:18:59.891 --> 00:19:01.930
<v Speaker 1>like if it got to a high enough level you like,</v>

599
00:19:01.931 --> 00:19:02.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

600
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I think we just hit the lid,</v>

601
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.590
<v Speaker 1>sell that shit and then you sell it.</v>

602
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

603
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:06.811
<v Speaker 1>buy low,</v>

604
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 1>sell high,</v>

605
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.303
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

606
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.810
<v Speaker 6>But the problem is you never know where highest and you never know where low</v>

607
00:19:11.811 --> 00:19:12.141
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>

608
00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:16.940
<v Speaker 6>Most people essentially end up falling for the basic psychology of panic and</v>

609
00:19:16.941 --> 00:19:21.941
<v Speaker 6>greed and so they end up actually buying high because of greed and selling low</v>

610
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:25.520
<v Speaker 6>because of panic and then they end up flipping that equation and losing a lot of</v>

611
00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

612
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.780
<v Speaker 6>Don't do it.</v>

613
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.220
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's really not worth it.</v>

614
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.590
<v Speaker 6>This is a very interesting technology.</v>

615
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.580
<v Speaker 6>Treating it like a penny stock and trying to,</v>

616
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.840
<v Speaker 6>we make money off it will only get you burned.</v>

617
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Well spoken is a true believer.</v>

618
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you on that and I think that's cool that you uh,</v>

619
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.553
<v Speaker 1>you stressed that.</v>

620
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.570
<v Speaker 1>What I keep hearing about this Mt.</v>

621
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Gox monkey in the news,</v>

622
00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:44.891
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

623
00:19:44.891 --> 00:19:46.480
<v Speaker 1>This guy is constantly in the news.</v>

624
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.160
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do with that dude?</v>

625
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who don't know,</v>

626
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.321
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>

627
00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:52.090
<v Speaker 1>if they haven't heard the earlier podcasts,</v>

628
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.380
<v Speaker 1>explain what this,</v>

629
00:19:53.381 --> 00:19:53.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

630
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Mt Gox situation is.</v>

631
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.530
<v Speaker 6>So first of all,</v>

632
00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:58.364
<v Speaker 6>there's no mountain.</v>

633
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.263
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

634
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 6>here's the interesting story.</v>

635
00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:05.510
<v Speaker 6>This started out as a trading site for a cards for playing cards called magic,</v>

636
00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:07.070
<v Speaker 6>the gathering online exchange,</v>

637
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.280
<v Speaker 1>which everybody knows and no offense to magic the gathering fans,</v>

638
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you guys are fucking dorks.</v>

639
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:12.591
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

640
00:20:12.591 --> 00:20:13.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no offense,</v>

641
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.211
<v Speaker 1>no offense,</v>

642
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:15.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dork too.</v>

643
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dorkiness too.</v>

644
00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:17.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things that I enjoy.</v>

645
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

646
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.420
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are fucking serious dorks.</v>

647
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was the basis for the original Mt.</v>

648
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Gox site and the domain at least.</v>

649
00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:27.681
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

650
00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And then it became this exchange,</v>

651
00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:33.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest exchanges in the world for Bitcoin,</v>

652
00:20:33.411 --> 00:20:34.940
<v Speaker 1>but not secure,</v>

653
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.590
<v Speaker 1>not coded properly,</v>

654
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.693
<v Speaker 1>just a wreck.</v>

655
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.461
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

656
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:39.294
<v Speaker 6>the thing is,</v>

657
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.750
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

658
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.470
<v Speaker 6>Mt.</v>

659
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.850
<v Speaker 6>Gox is I like to call it a,</v>

660
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 6>which kind of rhymes with Mt.</v>

661
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.330
<v Speaker 6>Gox.</v>

662
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.930
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

663
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.560
<v Speaker 6>because it really is just an acronym.</v>

664
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:47.394
<v Speaker 6>It's not a,</v>

665
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.423
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

666
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.610
<v Speaker 5>it started off as a trading site and it offered something really important and</v>

667
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:55.324
<v Speaker 5>valuable.</v>

668
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 5>In the early days of Bitcoin when you were trading locally among individuals,</v>

669
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.460
<v Speaker 5>there was no price discovery mechanism.</v>

670
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 5>There was no way to figure out how much a big coin was worth because there was</v>

671
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.330
<v Speaker 5>no liquid market.</v>

672
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.231
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

673
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:05.501
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

674
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:05.921
<v Speaker 5>if I,</v>

675
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 5>if I bought some bitcoin from you,</v>

676
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 5>we have to figure out what price we were both comfortable with and maybe we'd</v>

677
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:12.120
<v Speaker 5>ask somebody else to,</v>

678
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.251
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

679
00:21:12.251 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 5>how much did you buy it for?</v>

680
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 5>And that's how you discover the price,</v>

681
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

682
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 5>Because if there isn't a really big liquid market,</v>

683
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what the prices,</v>

684
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 5>was it more stable then?</v>

685
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:21.881
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

686
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.541
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

687
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 5>it was a even more volatile because keep in mind at the time,</v>

688
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin was trading for,</v>

689
00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

690
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 5>thousands of a penny a or pennies.</v>

691
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 5>So you could basically buy a thousand bitcoin for a dollar and you're really</v>

692
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 5>tastes</v>

693
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

694
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 3>And that would be worth what,</v>

695
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.200
<v Speaker 3>like a hundred grand now or something close to it.</v>

696
00:21:39.201 --> 00:21:39.890
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

697
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.250
<v Speaker 5>that wouldn't be worth half a million dollars.</v>

698
00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:41.760
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

699
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Half a million.</v>

700
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.331
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

701
00:21:43.331 --> 00:21:43.651
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

702
00:21:43.651 --> 00:21:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm so behind the price.</v>

703
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

704
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.280
<v Speaker 3>What is the price of 501?</v>

705
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:47.760
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

706
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:47.851
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

707
00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:48.960
<v Speaker 3>it's 500 bucks now.</v>

708
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

709
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

710
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I was way off as the thing goes.</v>

711
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.223
<v Speaker 3>300 something.</v>

712
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

713
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

714
00:21:52.921 --> 00:21:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I really wasn't sure between down what's the lowest it's been like in recent</v>

715
00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:57.264
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

716
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.681
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

717
00:21:58.681 --> 00:21:59.730
<v Speaker 5>so last year,</v>

718
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.530
<v Speaker 5>this time it jumped from about a hundred to two 66 and then dropped again down</v>

719
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:05.364
<v Speaker 5>to 50.</v>

720
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:05.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

721
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.190
<v Speaker 5>so at some point last year it was 50,</v>

722
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.421
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

723
00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:09.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

724
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.040
<v Speaker 5>in the meantime it's 500.</v>

725
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.220
<v Speaker 5>Then it went all the way up to about a thousand,</v>

726
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.990
<v Speaker 5>maybe 1100 on some markets,</v>

727
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.870
<v Speaker 5>and then it dumped all the way down to 800.</v>

728
00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:19.681
<v Speaker 5>Stayed there for a bit,</v>

729
00:22:19.681 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 5>and then it dumped all the way down to 500.</v>

730
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:25.260
<v Speaker 5>And then it had a brief period flirting with three 70,</v>

731
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:26.610
<v Speaker 5>and then it went back up.</v>

732
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:27.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

733
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 5>so here's what's happening.</v>

734
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

735
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.031
<v Speaker 5>every couple,</v>

736
00:22:30.031 --> 00:22:30.870
<v Speaker 5>every few weeks.</v>

737
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.770
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

738
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.250
<v Speaker 5>China started back in April of last year.</v>

739
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.780
<v Speaker 5>The China market opened up in,</v>

740
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.051
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

741
00:22:37.051 --> 00:22:37.331
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

742
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:38.400
<v Speaker 5>In November of last year,</v>

743
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 5>the China market opened up and everyone's like,</v>

744
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:40.760
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

745
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.930
<v Speaker 5>China's in bit coin to the moon.</v>

746
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.280
<v Speaker 5>The price shut up.</v>

747
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.330
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

748
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.020
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

749
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.950
<v Speaker 5>And then China said,</v>

750
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.740
<v Speaker 5>we're thinking of banding it and the price crashes and then,</v>

751
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.110
<v Speaker 5>but maybe we won't baton it to the price rises,</v>

752
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.790
<v Speaker 5>but maybe we'll ban it's and then the price crashes and we've been playing this,</v>

753
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.891
<v Speaker 5>is it band?</v>

754
00:22:57.891 --> 00:22:58.691
<v Speaker 5>Is it not band?</v>

755
00:22:58.691 --> 00:22:59.281
<v Speaker 5>Does it pans?</v>

756
00:22:59.281 --> 00:23:04.281
<v Speaker 5>Is it not band for the last five months and it's been a rollercoaster and in the</v>

757
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.030
<v Speaker 5>end or it really doesn't matter.</v>

758
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

759
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.040
<v Speaker 3>so for folks who don't know what we're talking about,</v>

760
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.630
<v Speaker 3>this Mt Gox thing was this online exchange that it turned out someone somehow,</v>

761
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 3>whether it was an inside job or not,</v>

762
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.740
<v Speaker 3>someone somehow was stealing money to the tune of hundreds of millions</v>

763
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.351
<v Speaker 5>took all of it.</v>

764
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:25.430
<v Speaker 5>The bitcoin took all of the money and they change 100% of it.</v>

765
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Well like 85 90% of it.</v>

766
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

767
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So someone somewhere stole an insane amount of money,</v>

768
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.480
<v Speaker 3>but you're not hearing about some wild man hunt to get to that money.</v>

769
00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:39.314
<v Speaker 3>If it was like,</v>

770
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.510
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy named Lee Marie all right.</v>

771
00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 3>And Lee Marie was a mixed martial arts fighter from the UK who is a real crazy</v>

772
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:46.970
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

773
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 3>He was like as white as they come.</v>

774
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 3>He was like a real live version of a character from a Guy Ritchie movie guy was</v>

775
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 3>nuts.</v>

776
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 3>He fought in the UFC.</v>

777
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 3>It was a really good fighter to fought Anderson Silva and cage rage.</v>

778
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean high level guy.</v>

779
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.093
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

780
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.560
<v Speaker 3>and he was also a fucking thug,</v>

781
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.580
<v Speaker 3>like super legit criminal and he was a part of a huge multimillion dollar bank</v>

782
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:15.971
<v Speaker 3>heist where they came in with fucking ski masks and bulletproof vests and,</v>

783
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

784
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 3>high powered rifles and machine guns though the full deal,</v>

785
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 3>like full black ops,</v>

786
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

787
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.163
<v Speaker 3>like a movie.</v>

788
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.010
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

789
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have the security cameras with these guys and then somehow or</v>

790
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 3>another they all got nabbed.</v>

791
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

792
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.053
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

793
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Lee Marie was a,</v>

794
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 3>one of the ones they chased after the hardest.</v>

795
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 3>He went to Morocco and he was hiding there and they got arrested there for,</v>

796
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 3>he got arrested there for like kidnapping someone a beaten him like after he did</v>

797
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 3>the bank job.</v>

798
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean this guy's a fucking maniac,</v>

799
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:45.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

800
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

801
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.490
<v Speaker 3>but the point is there was a fucking man hunt.</v>

802
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:51.740
<v Speaker 3>It was all over the newspapers in the UK.</v>

803
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 3>It was everywhere.</v>

804
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 3>They were going after these motherfuckers.</v>

805
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me like the amount of money that was stolen in Mt.</v>

806
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Gox is commensurate</v>

807
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.840
<v Speaker 5>to this or it's bigger,</v>

808
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 5>bigger,</v>

809
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:03.921
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

810
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 5>but here's,</v>

811
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.820
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>

812
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.653
<v Speaker 5>is it really bigger?</v>

813
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:06.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

814
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:06.884
<v Speaker 5>I think how much are they?</v>

815
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 5>How much was the UK Bank?</v>

816
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 5>Let me find out.</v>

817
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows exactly how much is gone at Cox,</v>

818
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 5>but it's somewhere between six and 800 million.</v>

819
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:14.751
<v Speaker 5>All my God,</v>

820
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:15.584
<v Speaker 5>it is bigger.</v>

821
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.700
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

822
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.170
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Madoff stole $20 billion,</v>

823
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.360
<v Speaker 5>20 billion with a B and there wasn't a man hunt there because the real truth is</v>

824
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 5>that if you want to rob a bank,</v>

825
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 5>what you do is you go get a banking license.</v>

826
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 5>Thank you for all of the bank using a keyboard instead of a machine gun.</v>

827
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 5>No one starts a man hunt that way.</v>

828
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

829
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.440
<v Speaker 5>that's the modern way of doing bank heists and,</v>

830
00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 5>and that's the way that doesn't get you a shot and nets you the biggest return.</v>

831
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.001
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

832
00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:52.350
<v Speaker 3>when you're a crazy criminal though,</v>

833
00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 3>and you don't know how to work keyboard fat,</v>

834
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.361
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

835
00:25:54.361 --> 00:25:54.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

836
00:25:54.481 --> 00:25:55.314
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be Italy.</v>

837
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.610
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be El three,</v>

838
00:25:56.611 --> 00:25:57.444
<v Speaker 3>three t,</v>

839
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.423
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

840
00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Pull that shit off.</v>

841
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.800
<v Speaker 3>So this Mt Gox thing.</v>

842
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.500
<v Speaker 3>Someone somewhere has stolen,</v>

843
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.060
<v Speaker 3>let's put a number on it.</v>

844
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.560
<v Speaker 3>You say $800 million.</v>

845
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:07.950
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

846
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 5>nobody knows that.</v>

847
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.560
<v Speaker 5>I was just saying $100 million.</v>

848
00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:11.940
<v Speaker 5>It's somewhere between five and eight,</v>

849
00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:12.430
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

850
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.400
<v Speaker 5>Let's just say it's $100 million.</v>

851
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.360
<v Speaker 5>Several hundred million dollars derivative and say it's $100 million from the</v>

852
00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:20.700
<v Speaker 5>current at the current bitcoin price.</v>

853
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

854
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 3>If someone stole a hundred fucking million dollars worth of money,</v>

855
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 3>like if $100 million worth of diamonds went missing,</v>

856
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.340
<v Speaker 3>what a man hunt there would be for that,</v>

857
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.520
<v Speaker 5>but something like that or,</v>

858
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.180
<v Speaker 5>or stolen and go missing in the banking system.</v>

859
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.180
<v Speaker 5>And in government affairs all the time.</v>

860
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 5>And there was no man hunt.</v>

861
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is fairly typical of what happens.</v>

862
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.913
<v Speaker 5>These are white collar.</v>

863
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 5>It's about</v>

864
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 6>records and forensic accounting and analysis and drawn out cases where they</v>

865
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 6>tried to figure out what happened.</v>

866
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.680
<v Speaker 6>The bottom line is every year about a hundred or more banks fail spectacularly</v>

867
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 6>and the money disappears.</v>

868
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.330
<v Speaker 6>And this was just another bank failure.</v>

869
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.780
<v Speaker 6>It really had very little to do with bitcoin.</v>

870
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.840
<v Speaker 6>It was a bank failure of the very traditional kinds.</v>

871
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:12.110
<v Speaker 6>This was not a system that's used bitcoin to protect its security.</v>

872
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 6>It was a systems that collected all of the bitcoin and one big account,</v>

873
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

874
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Speaker 6>and then lost that.</v>

875
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.770
<v Speaker 6>So it's essentially,</v>

876
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

877
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 6>the account was robbed in the account,</v>

878
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 6>just happened to be holding bitcoin.</v>

879
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

880
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.640
<v Speaker 6>And actually the dollar dollars dollar's had gone to</v>

881
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 6>the currency accounts in the banks were also,</v>

882
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.910
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

883
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:33.800
<v Speaker 6>how much was that?</v>

884
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.471
<v Speaker 6>Their dollars?</v>

885
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 6>Some dollars missing.</v>

886
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:35.791
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

887
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 6>It was a lot less money to man.</v>

888
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 6>It was a few million.</v>

889
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 6>It was a few million or maybe tens of millions,</v>

890
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:43.521
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

891
00:27:43.521 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't like hundreds.</v>

892
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.223
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

893
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

894
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing,</v>

895
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.010
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

896
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

897
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.970
<v Speaker 6>you have a bitcoin wallet,</v>

898
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:51.804
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

899
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 6>That means you control the keys.</v>

900
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 6>And that's the essence of Bitcoin is that individual's control them.</v>

901
00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:57.900
<v Speaker 6>They don't have a bank,</v>

902
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.950
<v Speaker 6>they don't have their money in a bank where someone else has custody of it and</v>

903
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 6>then they just have a little IOU note that says you have this much in the bank</v>

904
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 6>and maybe we'll give it to you when you come to was my next question.</v>

905
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 6>So Gox did not have individual account bitcoin accounts for the users.</v>

906
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.780
<v Speaker 6>They took the bitcoin and then put it all into one of their own accounts and,</v>

907
00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.123
<v Speaker 6>and managed it.</v>

908
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.060
<v Speaker 6>So they took it out all of the security of each person having their own keys and</v>

909
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 6>instead collected all the money in one vague wallet.</v>

910
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

911
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 6>that's crazy.</v>

912
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 6>Why would they do that?</v>

913
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 6>What's the benefit of that?</v>

914
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

915
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.263
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

916
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.250
<v Speaker 6>there's this instinct to implement the same types of centralized banking</v>

917
00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:38.941
<v Speaker 6>institutions.</v>

918
00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:39.571
<v Speaker 6>And here's the thing.</v>

919
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 6>When you have that much money under the control of an individual on an</v>

920
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 6>organization,</v>

921
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:50.570
<v Speaker 6>society then builds all of these regulatory institutions because they figured</v>

922
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 6>out that when you do that,</v>

923
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 6>those institutions,</v>

924
00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:55.080
<v Speaker 6>those organizations,</v>

925
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 6>those individuals steal the money again and again.</v>

926
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 6>When you put one person in charge of the money,</v>

927
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 6>they steal the money.</v>

928
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 6>That's what power corrupts.</v>

929
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 6>Absolute power corrupts absolutely,</v>

930
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 6>and there is no more powerful corrupting influence than money.</v>

931
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 6>So when you have people who have millions in their control,</v>

932
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 6>bad things happen.</v>

933
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:14.190
<v Speaker 6>Someone just fucks off with it.</v>

934
00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:17.910
<v Speaker 6>They just figured out a way to do it right or they're sloppy with their security</v>

935
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:19.140
<v Speaker 6>and somebody else robs them.</v>

936
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 6>But in either case,</v>

937
00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.530
<v Speaker 6>all of the banking regulations we have are to stop the fact that individual's</v>

938
00:29:25.531 --> 00:29:27.720
<v Speaker 6>control too much money from stealing that money.</v>

939
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 6>Bitcoin is a different solution.</v>

940
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 6>The idea is instead of collecting all the money in one big bucket,</v>

941
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.690
<v Speaker 6>you have each user controlling their own money.</v>

942
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:37.800
<v Speaker 6>You don't put it in a bank,</v>

943
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:39.630
<v Speaker 6>you don't concentrate the risk.</v>

944
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 6>And that way you don't need all of</v>

945
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 5>these elaborate controls because you don't take the control of the money away</v>

946
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:46.670
<v Speaker 5>from the individual.</v>

947
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 5>You leave it in the hands of the individuals.</v>

948
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:48.941
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

949
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

950
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 5>Gox took it away of the control of the individuals,</v>

951
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:55.060
<v Speaker 5>but then didn't have any of the regulatory institutions that we traditionally</v>

952
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:55.894
<v Speaker 5>have in banking,</v>

953
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 5>so they weren't using the bitcoin security and there weren't using the</v>

954
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 5>traditional banking regulations and audits to protect them.</v>

955
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 5>They were in this gray area in between where they had all of the control over</v>

956
00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:08.050
<v Speaker 5>the money and none of the protections.</v>

957
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.700
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

958
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

959
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 5>That is a vending competence as well.</v>

960
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean like really,</v>

961
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 5>really bad management of really bad coding.</v>

962
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Really bad technology use.</v>

963
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 5>Just gross and competence of an unbelievable scale.</v>

964
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean you'd think with all of that money they'd hire some competent people,</v>

965
00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:31.540
<v Speaker 5>but the incompetent started at the top.</v>

966
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:31.961
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

967
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 5>you look at the guy at the top and has dumped fat face.</v>

968
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 5>Look at that fucking dummy.</v>

969
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.091
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

970
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:38.680
<v Speaker 5>That guy's never been good at anything.</v>

971
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why right now,</v>

972
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.240
<v Speaker 2>God was a dump fat face like that.</v>

973
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:42.481
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

974
00:30:42.481 --> 00:30:44.190
<v Speaker 2>if you have a dumb fat face and you're smart,</v>

975
00:30:44.191 --> 00:30:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>

976
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Apologize Right now.</v>

977
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.420
<v Speaker 5>I have a dumb face to,</v>

978
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:48.620
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

979
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.251
<v Speaker 5>he plays magic.</v>

980
00:30:49.251 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 5>The gathering.</v>

981
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

982
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.020
<v Speaker 5>Well he doesn't just play it.</v>

983
00:30:51.021 --> 00:30:52.820
<v Speaker 5>He owns a fucking online exchange.</v>

984
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.511
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

985
00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:54.710
<v Speaker 5>he actually bought it from someone else.</v>

986
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.910
<v Speaker 5>How much do you pay for it?</v>

987
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.091
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

988
00:30:56.091 --> 00:30:56.571
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

989
00:30:56.571 --> 00:30:56.781
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

990
00:30:56.781 --> 00:30:57.620
<v Speaker 5>there was some kind of,</v>

991
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.750
<v Speaker 5>this goes way back in the early days,</v>

992
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.793
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing,</v>

993
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.060
<v Speaker 5>Mark Kurt Palace to the guy you just showed in that photo,</v>

994
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.230
<v Speaker 5>let's call big fat face.</v>

995
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.263
<v Speaker 5>Can we cut?</v>

996
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.390
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

997
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:08.780
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

998
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.360
<v Speaker 5>so I don't,</v>

999
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him personally.</v>

1000
00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:10.971
<v Speaker 5>I've never met him,</v>

1001
00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:15.860
<v Speaker 5>but he provided a really critical service at a time when bitcoin desperately</v>

1002
00:31:15.861 --> 00:31:16.281
<v Speaker 5>needed it.</v>

1003
00:31:16.281 --> 00:31:20.750
<v Speaker 5>He provided a market where people could buy and sell bitcoin in a transparent</v>

1004
00:31:20.751 --> 00:31:21.584
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

1005
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.710
<v Speaker 5>And for the first time you had bitcoin pricing,</v>

1006
00:31:24.711 --> 00:31:28.070
<v Speaker 5>you could figure out how much a bitcoin was worth because there were lots of</v>

1007
00:31:28.071 --> 00:31:28.791
<v Speaker 5>people trading it.</v>

1008
00:31:28.791 --> 00:31:33.470
<v Speaker 5>And therefore the price that they settled on over thousands of trades was priced</v>

1009
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:33.921
<v Speaker 5>discovery.</v>

1010
00:31:33.921 --> 00:31:34.151
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1011
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:35.900
<v Speaker 5>you need that to the market to function.</v>

1012
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.910
<v Speaker 5>So now you had a price and for many years the Mt Gox price was the price of</v>

1013
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:41.744
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin.</v>

1014
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1015
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:42.801
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1016
00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:44.690
<v Speaker 5>so we'll stop calling them big fat face,</v>

1017
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.790
<v Speaker 5>but then let's call poor bastard.</v>

1018
00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.653
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1019
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 2>So poor bastard starts out good.</v>

1020
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.340
<v Speaker 2>It starts out good,</v>

1021
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 2>everything's going great.</v>

1022
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:56.620
<v Speaker 2>He helps out a lot of people by letting them establish a price.</v>

1023
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:56.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 5>Which we made a huge difference for bitcoin.</v>

1025
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was the first time you had a liquid market where people could</v>

1026
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 5>actually trade knots just face to face,</v>

1027
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1028
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.850
<v Speaker 5>but could exchange of various currencies for bitcoin.</v>

1029
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 5>And that was incredibly important without,</v>

1030
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 5>without Mt.</v>

1031
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Gox</v>

1032
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.420
<v Speaker 2>so he's essentially,</v>

1033
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:16.250
<v Speaker 2>this is just a symptom of a growing market that he just wasn't prepared for.</v>

1034
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Like as if like here's a perfect example.</v>

1035
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.380
<v Speaker 2>If I was running something,</v>

1036
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.453
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1037
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dummy.</v>

1038
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Like when it comes to computers,</v>

1039
00:32:25.041 --> 00:32:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm a real dummy.</v>

1040
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 2>So if I was running some sort of online exchange and somehow or another it</v>

1041
00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:32.110
<v Speaker 2>started trading bitcoin and then I saw,</v>

1042
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.340
<v Speaker 2>started seeing hundreds of millions of dollars,</v>

1043
00:32:34.341 --> 00:32:34.741
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1044
00:32:34.741 --> 00:32:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I would have to bring people in.</v>

1045
00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I would have to bring in like financial experts,</v>

1046
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 2>coding experts.</v>

1047
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 5>I have to try to anywhere,</v>

1048
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:41.590
<v Speaker 5>any experts,</v>

1049
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.731
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1050
00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:42.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm busy as fuck man.</v>

1051
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't probably do it right.</v>

1052
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 5>I would probably fuck it up just the way poor bastard fucked it up.</v>

1053
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 5>So can't really blame him except he's got his finger out.</v>

1055
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1056
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.933
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing.</v>

1057
00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you back buddy.</v>

1058
00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 5>There's a chance,</v>

1059
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1060
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.720
<v Speaker 5>we don't know if this was just gross waste management or also fraud.</v>

1061
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna go as far as say poor bastard because there's a good chance that</v>

1062
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 5>he heard,</v>

1063
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 5>he heard a lot of people very badly and there's a,</v>

1064
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a chance that he was culpable.</v>

1065
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Big Fat face,</v>

1066
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 5>you will find out.</v>

1067
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1068
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time,</v>

1069
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 5>it's a classic story of someone who,</v>

1070
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.153
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1071
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.440
<v Speaker 5>was in a situation that was way over their head and then they tried to handle it</v>

1072
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 5>without asking for help.</v>

1073
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 5>And then it snowballed and they tried to cover up some mistakes by trying to</v>

1074
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 5>cover up,</v>

1075
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 5>by making bigger mistakes and then bigger mistakes and then bigger mistakes.</v>

1076
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 5>How did you try to cover it up?</v>

1077
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.171
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1078
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:39.591
<v Speaker 5>once,</v>

1079
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:40.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1080
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:45.130
<v Speaker 5>so some money was taken in an earlier incident from the system and then I think</v>

1081
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:53.381
<v Speaker 5>he tried to cover up the lack of money by essentially generating more fees from,</v>

1082
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:54.350
<v Speaker 5>from the customers.</v>

1083
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1084
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.121
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1085
00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:59.870
<v Speaker 5>paying for the previous loss by bringing in new customers and trying to stay</v>

1086
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:01.190
<v Speaker 5>ahead of the loss,</v>

1087
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 5>which by the way,</v>

1088
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 5>you've seen,</v>

1089
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.130
<v Speaker 5>we've seen this again and again,</v>

1090
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 5>it's a Bernie Madoff movie.</v>

1091
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 5>Essentially it was running a mini pyramid scheme,</v>

1092
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1093
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:08.211
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1094
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:12.350
<v Speaker 5>and Pyramid Scheme pyramid schemes are very rarely intentional.</v>

1095
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Nobody starts out to Sam going to run a pyramid scheme.</v>

1096
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 5>What happens is they take a bat,</v>

1097
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.220
<v Speaker 5>they lose on that bet and then they tried to cover up the fact that they lost by</v>

1098
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 5>bringing in more people and the like,</v>

1099
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.220
<v Speaker 5>as long as I stay ahead of this,</v>

1100
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to bite me.</v>

1101
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.710
<v Speaker 5>And then it gets bigger and bigger.</v>

1102
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 5>We saw that with that trader in,</v>

1103
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1104
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.860
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a one of the Swiss banks,</v>

1105
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1106
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.300
<v Speaker 5>who was,</v>

1107
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.710
<v Speaker 5>who was essentially trading bigger and bigger bets in order to cover up previous</v>

1108
00:34:36.711 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 5>mistakes and getting further out until eventually it all collapsed.</v>

1109
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 5>And we've seen this happen again and again.</v>

1110
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 5>It's really trying to cover up an early mistake by making a bigger mistake.</v>

1111
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 5>And then it snowballs.</v>

1112
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1113
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 5>I have seen legit pyramid schemes.</v>

1114
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:54.110
<v Speaker 5>I had a guy who was a coach at a boxing gym,</v>

1115
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.000
<v Speaker 5>tried to talk me into a pyramid scheme.</v>

1116
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was describing it in the dumbest way ever.</v>

1117
00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 5>He was describing a pyramid scheme.</v>

1118
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 5>He's like a bunch of people put the money in and then a,</v>

1119
00:35:03.951 --> 00:35:04.161
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1120
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:04.731
<v Speaker 5>I got money.</v>

1121
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1122
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.440
<v Speaker 5>that's how I got these rooms on my truck.</v>

1123
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:07.281
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1124
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:08.150
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

1125
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:08.751
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1126
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:08.871
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1127
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:09.621
<v Speaker 5>you invest,</v>

1128
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:09.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1129
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:12.410
<v Speaker 5>you put money in the new people come in and then,</v>

1130
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:12.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1131
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:14.160
<v Speaker 5>you could take money out of the new people coming.</v>

1132
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:14.361
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1133
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:15.194
<v Speaker 5>it's a pyramid scheme.</v>

1134
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.453
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what you're saying?</v>

1135
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.031
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1136
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 5>he didn't know what a pyramid scheme was.</v>

1137
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1138
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:19.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1139
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 5>I learned that lesson in seventh grade.</v>

1140
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.541
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1141
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:24.374
<v Speaker 5>it's a very,</v>

1142
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.930
<v Speaker 5>my school buddies were running a little um,</v>

1143
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 5>candy permit scheme,</v>

1144
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.890
<v Speaker 5>a candy Perez.</v>

1145
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:32.720
<v Speaker 5>Basically it was candy was um,</v>

1146
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:33.831
<v Speaker 5>what do you call it?</v>

1147
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:34.664
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

1148
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 5>we had one of those uh,</v>

1149
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>cantinas where you</v>

1150
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.990
<v Speaker 6>could buy doughnuts and things like that.</v>

1151
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.380
<v Speaker 6>So it was kind of like a doughnut.</v>

1152
00:35:41.381 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 6>It's a pyramid scheme based on the school canteen that wears.</v>

1153
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1154
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1155
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 6>but they actually drew it on the,</v>

1156
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 6>on the blackboard as a,</v>

1157
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:53.820
<v Speaker 6>as an airplane where you sit at the front and then two people sit behind you and</v>

1158
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:55.410
<v Speaker 6>then four people sit behind you.</v>

1159
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.180
<v Speaker 6>And then it was kind of like,</v>

1160
00:35:57.181 --> 00:36:01.080
<v Speaker 6>it was called the airplane and it was basically a permit scheme that some kid</v>

1161
00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 6>had heard from somewhere and introduced into the class.</v>

1162
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 6>And then our teacher sat us down and said,</v>

1163
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 6>this is what a pyramid scheme is and this is why you're not allowed to do this</v>

1164
00:36:08.851 --> 00:36:09.684
<v Speaker 6>in the school.</v>

1165
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Does he does it to see what you'd want to like find out where that guy is now of</v>

1166
00:36:14.951 --> 00:36:19.951
<v Speaker 2>even if he was doing that with candy back then when I can creep in of Avon,</v>

1167
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I would like to send him a thank you card or a real life financial education.</v>

1168
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean what a valuable lesson to learn early and then not fall for it again.</v>

1169
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.250
<v Speaker 2>That is so true.</v>

1170
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Especially because you got to see it in an actual form,</v>

1171
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.670
<v Speaker 2>not like some sort of abstract lesson that's someone's teaching.</v>

1172
00:36:36.671 --> 00:36:38.170
<v Speaker 2>You got to see it actually play out.</v>

1173
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.260
<v Speaker 2>PLO 800 people in the school.</v>

1174
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.760
<v Speaker 2>It fizzles out pretty quickly.</v>

1175
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You run out of soccer,</v>

1176
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.280
<v Speaker 2>soccer really,</v>

1177
00:36:45.281 --> 00:36:45.971
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

1178
00:36:45.971 --> 00:36:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1179
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.870
<v Speaker 2>So it only lasted</v>

1180
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 6>I think about two weeks before the whole thing came crashing down,</v>

1181
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:51.270
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1182
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 6>but it was a fantastic demonstration in real life in a closed controlled</v>

1183
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 6>environments and the only losses were really to the collapse of the local donuts</v>

1184
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:00.474
<v Speaker 6>economy.</v>

1185
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.323
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

1186
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:01.960
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1187
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 2>the guy who came up to me,</v>

1188
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I explained to him that it was a pyramid scheme and he still tried to sell me on</v>

1189
00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:07.210
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1190
00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:07.570
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1191
00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1192
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:07.961
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1193
00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you you should do it.</v>

1194
00:37:08.981 --> 00:37:09.590
<v Speaker 2>You should put your money.</v>

1195
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:09.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1196
00:37:09.911 --> 00:37:10.870
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>

1197
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Like did I just explained to you what this is is a pyramid scheme.</v>

1198
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.190
<v Speaker 2>You know what a pyramid scheme is?</v>

1199
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Like people get ripped off,</v>

1200
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.171
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1201
00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get ripped off.</v>

1202
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1203
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.353
<v Speaker 2>I gotta go.</v>

1204
00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:25.570
<v Speaker 2>but this was a pyramid scheme almost like just to cover up in competence and</v>

1206
00:37:25.571 --> 00:37:30.400
<v Speaker 2>then it sort of snowballed like a lie that you couldn't help and then that lie,</v>

1207
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you might have got a bunch of their lives to cover that.</v>

1208
00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 2>La and then La.</v>

1209
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:35.191
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1210
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:35.671
<v Speaker 6>keep in mind,</v>

1211
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:36.391
<v Speaker 6>I'm speculating,</v>

1212
00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:38.760
<v Speaker 6>this is based on the information we have right now.</v>

1213
00:37:38.761 --> 00:37:42.240
<v Speaker 6>We've seen that there were a couple of failures early on and then it seems like</v>

1214
00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:43.920
<v Speaker 6>he was trying to cover up for those.</v>

1215
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.463
<v Speaker 2>We don't know yet.</v>

1216
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1217
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.880
<v Speaker 2>This is only going to come out.</v>

1218
00:37:46.881 --> 00:37:48.410
<v Speaker 2>He was a part of it as well.</v>

1219
00:37:48.411 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1220
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 6>We don't know how much was stolen by outside people.</v>

1221
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1222
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 6>he certainly did try to cover losses,</v>

1223
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:59.660
<v Speaker 6>but we don't know if those losses occurred because he lost a keys to,</v>

1224
00:37:59.740 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

1225
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 6>to bitcoin and essentially lost the money or if it was stolen or if it was</v>

1226
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 6>embezzled or if it was whatever.</v>

1227
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.063
<v Speaker 6>We don't know.</v>

1228
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:13.100
<v Speaker 6>And there's now parallel prosecutions happening both in Japan and in the United</v>

1229
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 6>States to find the answers to that.</v>

1230
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.250
<v Speaker 6>Here's the interesting thing.</v>

1231
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.540
<v Speaker 6>We're going to find out the answers to that because Bitcoin uses a public ledger</v>

1232
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.600
<v Speaker 6>and there's forensic evidence sprinkled in the bitcoin transaction leisure that</v>

1233
00:38:27.301 --> 00:38:30.240
<v Speaker 6>allows us to track exactly what happens.</v>

1234
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 6>This is the most transparent financial system.</v>

1235
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 6>So we're going to get some really interesting answers so we'll be able to find</v>

1236
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v Speaker 5>out who has it.</v>

1237
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.051
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1238
00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1239
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.281
<v Speaker 5>not really,</v>

1240
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 5>but we're going to be able to find out what happened and when it happens.</v>

1241
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1242
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 5>you'd just happened when it happened,</v>

1243
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 5>but you can't find out where it went and you can't track it.</v>

1244
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.183
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1245
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.020
<v Speaker 5>Can,</v>

1246
00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 5>you can't track Ip addresses through Bitcoin.</v>

1247
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.920
<v Speaker 5>You can or can't,</v>

1248
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.401
<v Speaker 5>cannot,</v>

1249
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:52.000
<v Speaker 5>cannot,</v>

1250
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.833
<v Speaker 5>cannot.</v>

1251
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.171
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1252
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:53.731
<v Speaker 5>you can't home.</v>

1253
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 5>So there's no way to figure out where that stuff went,</v>

1254
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 5>where the bitcoins went.</v>

1255
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:58.330
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>

1256
00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>

1257
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.060
<v Speaker 5>But you can see when it went out,</v>

1258
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:03.930
<v Speaker 5>all of accounts that wouldn't known to be controlled by Gox and,</v>

1259
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 5>and so you can rebuild a timeline.</v>

1260
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 5>Here's the other thing that's not going to happen.</v>

1261
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

1262
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Gox didn't get bailed out.</v>

1263
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.393
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1264
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.910
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

1265
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.290
<v Speaker 5>Gox didn't get 0% interest loans from a central bank in order to pretend they're</v>

1266
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 5>solvent when they're not.</v>

1267
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Mt Gox didn't make deals with other banks to cover up their losses by</v>

1268
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 5>collateralizing them in CDOS.</v>

1269
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:25.721
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

1270
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:29.020
<v Speaker 5>Gox didn't get to acquire some of the failing banks,</v>

1271
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 5>add them to their asset sheets and for them,</v>

1272
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 5>pretend that they were not failing.</v>

1273
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

1274
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 5>Gox didn't gets to bail in all of the customers of bitcoin across the entire</v>

1275
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:38.224
<v Speaker 5>economy.</v>

1276
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.070
<v Speaker 5>Mt.</v>

1277
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 5>Gox didn't get too hyper inflate the currency in order to save themselves,</v>

1278
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:44.110
<v Speaker 5>but destroy the economy.</v>

1279
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.620
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1280
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 5>All of those things happened after 2008.</v>

1281
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:47.591
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a second.</v>

1282
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:52.591
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying sounds exactly like what went on with our economy.</v>

1283
00:39:53.471 --> 00:39:54.304
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1285
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:55.760
<v Speaker 5>law.</v>

1286
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

1287
00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

1288
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Does this guy in trouble?</v>

1289
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1290
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1292
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.210

1293
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:04.990
<v Speaker 5>he might,</v>

1294
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 5>he might be,</v>

1295
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.680
<v Speaker 5>he might be one of the few examples of banker's going to jail.</v>

1296
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:09.790
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1297
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.151
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1298
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 5>Which doesn't happen very often.</v>

1299
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.970
<v Speaker 5>It really happens in two cases.</v>

1300
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.761
<v Speaker 5>It happens.</v>

1301

<v Speaker 5>Or A,</v>

1309
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.600
<v Speaker 5>it happens for those who steal money from very,</v>

00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 5>very rich people.</v>

00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:27.310
<v Speaker 5>Can't do that.</v>

1312
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Madoff didn't steal.</v>

1313
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:31.330
<v Speaker 5>I didn't steal millions of mortgages from people.</v>

<v Speaker 5>very rich people.</v>

1317

<v Speaker 5>You can't get away with that.</v>

1318
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:35.320
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1326
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 5>he's in Japan right now.</v>

1327
00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:44.260
<v Speaker 5>There's a extradition requests.</v>

1328
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 5>They know where he is.</v>

1329
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.151
<v Speaker 5>I believe so,</v>

1330
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:46.301
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>How has no one killed him?</v>

1332
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.431
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1333
00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:51.080
<v Speaker 5>you would think that this guy with hundreds of millions of dollars,</v>

1334
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.050
<v Speaker 5>like every step that God takes,</v>

1335
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 5>you must be looking over his shoulder.</v>

1336
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.630
<v Speaker 5>Does he still look like that?</v>

1337
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.660
<v Speaker 5>I would shave my head and grow big tape beard.</v>

1338
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.863
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1339
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.210
<v Speaker 5>free.</v>

1340
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.950
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1341
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:00.783
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

1342
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 5>Japan has very,</v>

1343
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 5>very few,</v>

1344
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 5>very low incidences of violent crime.</v>

1345
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.811
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1346
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 5>there's not too many weapons around.</v>

1347
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.160
<v Speaker 5>The culture is not like that.</v>

1348
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 5>And then the other culture,</v>

1349
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 5>which is a well geeks like me,</v>

1350
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1351
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:17.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1352
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.763
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1353
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.350
<v Speaker 5>I am trying to attack someone and caused them harm.</v>

1354
00:41:22.351 --> 00:41:27.160
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to reach for an asthma inhaler four times in the process of committing</v>

1355
00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:27.994
<v Speaker 5>a crime.</v>

1356
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.901
<v Speaker 5>But it seems like a guy,</v>

1357
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:32.050
<v Speaker 5>like you could figure out a way to code an APP for your phone.</v>

1358
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 5>The controls are drone that shoots</v>

1359
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.113
<v Speaker 3>missiles.</v>

1360
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:35.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1361
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1362
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I would think you'd see people like you'd be the worst people to fuck.</v>

1363
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Not motivated enough.</v>

1364
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

1365
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 3>but you're not motivated.</v>

1366
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:42.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1367
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:45.440
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't lose hundreds of millions of dollars is cat.</v>

1368
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Like what if you had $100 million in that 800 plus whatever it was that</v>

1369
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 3>disappeared if $100 million,</v>

1370
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.430
<v Speaker 3>whatever Poe plus or minus was all yours.</v>

1372
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:55.711
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1373
00:41:55.711 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 3>it'd be fucking bloody furious.</v>

1374
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.830
<v Speaker 5>And there are a lot of people who are very upset and very hurt by this</v>

1375
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:01.550
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

1376
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of people who lost a lot of money,</v>

1377
00:42:03.081 --> 00:42:03.960
<v Speaker 5>including a,</v>

1378
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 5>it had a ripple effect.</v>

1379
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:10.300
<v Speaker 5>You've got to realize that many bitcoin businesses had money in accounts there.</v>

1380
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

1381
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.620
<v Speaker 5>So that loss then affected the cashflow of,</v>

1382
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 5>of other bitcoin businesses that suffered and charities,</v>

1383
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.260
<v Speaker 5>many charities that lost money and,</v>

1384
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 5>and Mt.</v>

1385
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Gox</v>

1386
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:21.941

1389
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.373
<v Speaker 5>pewter company.</v>

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.140
<v Speaker 5>overstock.com both of those hues.</v>

1391
00:42:32.141 --> 00:42:32.500

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:33.430
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1394
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.263
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

1395
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.261
<v Speaker 5>Overstock,</v>

1396
00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:36.760
<v Speaker 5>keep hearing good things about overstock.</v>

1397
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1398
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.550
<v Speaker 5>They generally don't have much exposure because they don't,</v>

1399
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.030
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1400
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.863
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>

1401
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.240
<v Speaker 5>people who are using it as an exchange,</v>

1402
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.490
<v Speaker 5>so when you have excess bit coin,</v>

1403
00:42:45.491 --> 00:42:46.520
<v Speaker 5>move it in their self,</v>

1404
00:42:46.521 --> 00:42:46.931
<v Speaker 5>a dollars,</v>

1405
00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 5>move the dollars out.</v>

1406
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.060
<v Speaker 5>It just in and out.</v>

1407
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1408
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.900
<v Speaker 5>The first is storing the bitcoin there as a wallet,</v>

1409
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1410
00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.760
<v Speaker 5>and giving them full control of that and just leaving piles of bitcoin there.</v>

1411
00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:02.800
<v Speaker 5>Those were the ones most affected and some of the day traders who had to have</v>

1412
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.830
<v Speaker 5>piles of bitcoin there so that they could trade very quickly.</v>

1413
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.600
<v Speaker 5>Those were very affected.</v>

1414
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.550
<v Speaker 5>But people who just moved money in and out,</v>

1415
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1416
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.770
<v Speaker 5>maybe they lost that day's take.</v>

1417
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.211
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1418
00:43:12.211 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 5>and if you look at it,</v>

1419
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.220
<v Speaker 5>merchants like the ones you mentioned,</v>

1420
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1421
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.270
<v Speaker 5>they don't leave stashes of bitcoin around.</v>

1422
00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.050
<v Speaker 5>They're going to exchange that pretty quickly.</v>

1423
00:43:20.051 --> 00:43:22.150
<v Speaker 5>They're going to move out of the exchange if they're smart.</v>

1424
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.450
<v Speaker 3>So they exchange it for dollars and then they move.</v>

1425
00:43:24.451 --> 00:43:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1426
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:25.501
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1427
00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:26.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1428
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.700
<v Speaker 3>how much can you actually store on your phone or your phone?</v>

1429
00:43:29.701 --> 00:43:30.690
<v Speaker 3>Like if you wanted a store,</v>

1430
00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:32.060
<v Speaker 3>$1 million with the Bitcoin,</v>

1431
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.180
<v Speaker 3>could you put it on your phone?</v>

1432
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.320
<v Speaker 5>You could store $1 trillion worth of bitcoin.</v>

1433
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.170
<v Speaker 5>You could store whatever you want.</v>

1434
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:38.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1435
00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:40.150
<v Speaker 3>there is no one in case you lose your phone,</v>

1436
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1437
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.950
<v Speaker 3>You'd have your phone connected to your wrist and all wrapped around your waist</v>

1438
00:43:44.951 --> 00:43:45.784
<v Speaker 3>with chains.</v>

1439
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1440
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 5>that would be a supremely dumb and bad idea to do.</v>

1441
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:51.370
<v Speaker 5>But you can't make backups of Bitcoin,</v>

1442
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 5>which you can't do with regular money.</v>

1443
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 5>You can have multiple copies,</v>

1444
00:43:55.131 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 5>you can encrypt those copies.</v>

1445
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:59.780
<v Speaker 5>So you can do a lot of things to protect yourself against loss.</v>

1446
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Can you have what you call it?</v>

1447
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.740
<v Speaker 5>Like can you have like your main wallet and then like have like a sub wallet</v>

1448
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 5>that hasn't completely different like pass code or a way to get in?</v>

1449
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1450
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

1451
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:10.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1452
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 5>You can actually make a whole tree structure of wallets.</v>

1453
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 5>So why didn't like this,</v>

1454
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 5>this company,</v>

1455
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:17.550
<v Speaker 5>this mk or whatever it's called to God,</v>

1456
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.000
<v Speaker 5>why didn't they just have a shitload of sub wallets,</v>

1457
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1458
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.930
<v Speaker 5>to protect each individual user instead of putting it into one.</v>

1459
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

1460
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 5>that that goes to the gross and competence I was talking about earlier.</v>

1461
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 5>So that's not how they,</v>

1462
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 5>there are are the businesses who also have custodial account</v>

1463
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.220
<v Speaker 7>over bitcoin and they implement very smart systems to segregate bitcoin.</v>

1464
00:44:37.221 --> 00:44:38.054
<v Speaker 7>So for example,</v>

1465
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 7>on a daily basis,</v>

1466
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:44.481
<v Speaker 7>they will sweep 95 to 98% of the bitcoin off into a wallets.</v>

1467
00:44:45.661 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 7>The require three out of six people to come together.</v>

1468
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 7>To unlock them with the key separated on separate devices.</v>

1469
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:54.743
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1470
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.000
<v Speaker 7>and those systems are very difficult to break,</v>

1471
00:44:57.001 --> 00:44:57.301
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1472
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 7>Because you need collusion between multiple people and that protects both from</v>

1473
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:01.560
<v Speaker 7>external theft,</v>

1474
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 7>but it also protects from internal compromise,</v>

1475
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:06.770
<v Speaker 7>a malicious insider or um,</v>

1476
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.050
<v Speaker 7>embezzlement fraud even by the CEO sometimes.</v>

1477
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:13.260
<v Speaker 7>So there are ways to get around this.</v>

1478
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:18.000
<v Speaker 7>You can have good security practices and all of those good security practices</v>

1479
00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:22.600
<v Speaker 7>were completely ignored by Mark Karpeles.</v>

1480
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 7>So he's a fuck head no matter what.</v>

1481
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:25.930
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1482
00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:30.930
<v Speaker 7>So the question really now is gross incompetence or fraud and we don't know,</v>

1483
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:31.870
<v Speaker 7>but in,</v>

1484
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.360
<v Speaker 7>in either case it's bad.</v>

1485
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 7>It hurt a lot of people,</v>

1486
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 7>but in the end it had nothing to do with bitcoin.</v>

1487
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:40.800
<v Speaker 7>It was a classic bank failure of the traditional kind that it was the result of</v>

1488
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:44.940
<v Speaker 7>the fact that they fell in a gray area where they didn't have the protections of</v>

1489
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 7>bitcoin and they didn't have the regulations of a regular bank.</v>

1490
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.410
<v Speaker 2>So this guy lives in Japan.</v>

1491
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Did he move to Japan when the shit hit the fan or was he there the entire time?</v>

1492
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.030
<v Speaker 2>He was there the entire time.</v>

1493
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 2>So he's always lived in Japan.</v>

1494
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Speaker 2>That's where Mt.</v>

1495
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:56.851
<v Speaker 2>Gox was based.</v>

1496
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1497
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1498
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:58.080
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1499
00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1500
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.831
<v Speaker 2>Mt.</v>

1501
00:45:58.831 --> 00:45:59.664
<v Speaker 2>Gox I love it.</v>

1502
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 2>And so Mt.</v>

1503
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Gox now is insolvent.</v>

1504
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.501
<v Speaker 2>Is it done?</v>

1505
00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:05.334
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was some</v>

1506
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.400
<v Speaker 7>trying to do some kind of structured thing and then,</v>

1507
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:08.780
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1508
00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 7>I think it was four or five days ago,</v>

1509
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:15.531
<v Speaker 7>the Japanese authorities decided to decline and forced them into liquidation.</v>

1510
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.650
<v Speaker 7>So they are now done and tick boxes over.</v>

1511
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.000
<v Speaker 7>The one thing we can say about Mt Gox is that they can no longer hurt</v>

1512
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:24.933
<v Speaker 2>anyone else.</v>

1513
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.170
<v Speaker 2>That's the good thing.</v>

1514
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:26.471
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1515
00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:28.990
<v Speaker 2>this gentleman who runs it or ran it,</v>

1516
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.210
<v Speaker 2>he's walking on the streets.</v>

1517
00:46:31.211 --> 00:46:32.050
<v Speaker 2>He goes places.</v>

1518
00:46:32.051 --> 00:46:33.220
<v Speaker 2>He's just like a regular guy.</v>

1519
00:46:33.221 --> 00:46:34.054
<v Speaker 2>Do they follow him?</v>

1520
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:34.751
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1521
00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I think he's on,</v>

1522
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.310
<v Speaker 2>he's under indictment.</v>

1523
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:36.611
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1524
00:46:36.611 --> 00:46:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his status is.</v>

1525
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.080
<v Speaker 2>So He's under indictment from America and from Japan.</v>

1526
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1527
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:41.980
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1528
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.740
<v Speaker 2>and there's a warrant for him to come to the states.</v>

1529
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1530
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:45.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1531
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1532
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not as gangster as if he robbed a bank and held it up with guns.</v>

1533
00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not,</v>

1534
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.930
<v Speaker 2>they're not going after him with like a swat team and dragging them back,</v>

1535
00:46:55.931 --> 00:46:58.030
<v Speaker 2>but most likely he's fucked.</v>

1536
00:46:59.050 --> 00:46:59.620
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

1537
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1538
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:01.143
<v Speaker 2>most likely.</v>

1539
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:02.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1541
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I would be surprised if he doesn't face some kind of a serious consequences.</v>

1542
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:12.040
<v Speaker 2>You weren't that concerned though about this in the overall scheme of things for</v>

1543
00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:12.611
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

1544
00:47:12.611 --> 00:47:15.610
<v Speaker 2>You thought this was just sort of a bump in the road and that eventually it</v>

1545
00:47:15.611 --> 00:47:20.410
<v Speaker 2>would be overwhelmed by the sheer positive benefits of cryptocurrencies?</v>

1546
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.621
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1547
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:22.670
<v Speaker 7>I mean I think the,</v>

1548
00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.120
<v Speaker 7>the thing is that it didn't really affect bitcoin itself.</v>

1549
00:47:26.121 --> 00:47:27.350
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't a weakness of bitcoin.</v>

1550
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 7>It was in fact a very strong arguments</v>

1551
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.620
<v Speaker 6>for why you need to decentralize financial institutions.</v>

1552
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:33.670
<v Speaker 6>Cause when you centralize them,</v>

1553
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 6>they failed in exactly this fashion.</v>

1554
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:35.780
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1555
00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.580
<v Speaker 6>that's what we're trying to change about financial services.</v>

1556
00:47:39.581 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 6>Make them more decentralized,</v>

1557
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 6>diffuse the power so it can be corrupted and,</v>

1558
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 6>and compromised.</v>

1559
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.013
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1560
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 6>there are going to be more,</v>

1561
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you right now,</v>

1562
00:47:48.701 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 6>there are going to be more bank failures Bolson bitcoin and of course as they</v>

1563
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 6>happen every single year by the hundreds,</v>

1564
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 6>they're going to be bank failures in every currency including bitcoin.</v>

1565
00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.870
<v Speaker 6>There are going to be CEOs who run away with the money until we implement better</v>

1566
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 6>solutions to control the power.</v>

1567
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>

1568
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 6>if you've got a startup and they raising money in Bitcoin,</v>

1569
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.220
<v Speaker 6>you don't give all of the keys to one person use,</v>

1570
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 6>you split them among multiple people.</v>

1571
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:14.471
<v Speaker 6>So that one part,</v>

1572
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:19.471
<v Speaker 6>because the person you think you know who's your Cherice partner in this venture</v>

1573
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 6>and you've known all your life and your childhood friends,</v>

1574
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1575
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.110
<v Speaker 6>when they have access to a couple million dollars,</v>

1576
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 6>they change,</v>

1577
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 6>people change their dramatically and radically affected by money.</v>

1578
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 6>And then all you need is a precipitating event,</v>

1579
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 6>an illness in the family,</v>

1580
00:48:36.191 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Speaker 6>a crisis,</v>

1581
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1582
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.210
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

1583
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 6>a bad thing happening to that person.</v>

1584
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 6>And they will grab that money and run.</v>

1585
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.120
<v Speaker 6>People make very poor decisions</v>

1586
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.030
<v Speaker 2>and they still tell you the,</v>

1587
00:48:44.031 --> 00:48:44.421
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1588
00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:44.921
<v Speaker 2>I needed it.</v>

1589
00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1590
00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.040
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1591
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.580
<v Speaker 6>And they'll rationalize it or they'll make a mistake day trading and making a</v>

1592
00:48:49.581 --> 00:48:53.120
<v Speaker 6>loss or losing some of the money and then trying to cover it up,</v>

1593
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.290
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is that,</v>

1594
00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1595
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.070
<v Speaker 6>my advice to bitcoin companies is when you're starting out,</v>

1596
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.760
<v Speaker 6>look at the person sitting next to you and do not assume you can trust them,</v>

1597
00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:07.060
<v Speaker 6>assumes that people are fallible and then put in place controls so that no</v>

1598
00:49:07.131 --> 00:49:10.490
<v Speaker 6>single person can run away with money and then you're going to be much more</v>

1599
00:49:10.491 --> 00:49:12.800
<v Speaker 6>secure and everybody will be able to be above board.</v>

1600
00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.860
<v Speaker 2>David Seaman who was on the podcast last week had a really interesting take on</v>

1601
00:49:16.861 --> 00:49:18.980
<v Speaker 2>big coin that I thought it was kinda funny.</v>

1602
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1603
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.210
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that if,</v>

1604
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.530
<v Speaker 2>if bank,</v>

1605
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:23.850
<v Speaker 2>like Bank of America for [inaudible],</v>

1606
00:49:23.851 --> 00:49:24.720
<v Speaker 2>if they were smart,</v>

1607
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.000
<v Speaker 2>they would get involved in bitcoin.</v>

1608
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:31.260
<v Speaker 2>It was like you already have this established name brand,</v>

1609
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>like cryptocurrencies are going to be here.</v>

1610
00:49:33.151 --> 00:49:33.390
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1611
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.750
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1612
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.230
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1613
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.063
<v Speaker 2>they're here to stay.</v>

1614
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:35.903
<v Speaker 2>This is his take.</v>

1615
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:37.243
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1616
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:41.250
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you capitalize on the name brand that you've already built in on</v>

1617
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 2>and get in on the mark and quick get it on it now and the early days and</v>

1618
00:49:45.841 --> 00:49:50.841
<v Speaker 2>established like that Bank of America like still has like a footing in in this</v>

1619
00:49:51.751 --> 00:49:53.730
<v Speaker 2>as well as in regular money.</v>

1620
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.540
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1621
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.130
<v Speaker 2>it would be a really wise investment.</v>

1622
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.100
<v Speaker 6>I think you're going to see that happening.</v>

1623
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.120
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1624
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.340
<v Speaker 6>in short time really,</v>

1625
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:02.581
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1626
00:50:02.581 --> 00:50:03.720
<v Speaker 6>we saw this with the Internet,</v>

1627
00:50:03.721 --> 00:50:07.620
<v Speaker 6>which was at first the telecommunications companies fought tooth and nail.</v>

1628
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:12.390
<v Speaker 6>They could not believe that a decentralized packet switch network like the</v>

1629
00:50:12.391 --> 00:50:14.370
<v Speaker 6>Internet would deliver quality,</v>

1630
00:50:14.371 --> 00:50:15.840
<v Speaker 6>voice and quality video.</v>

1631
00:50:15.841 --> 00:50:18.570
<v Speaker 6>They wanted to build highly controlled and structured networks.</v>

1632
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.800
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1633
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.120
<v Speaker 6>and they tried to fight it because it,</v>

1634
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.310
<v Speaker 6>it threatens and long distance market,</v>

1635
00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:24.450
<v Speaker 6>which was very lucrative.</v>

1636
00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:25.680
<v Speaker 6>It threatened many other markets.</v>

1637
00:50:25.681 --> 00:50:26.514
<v Speaker 6>Today,</v>

1638
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 6>three quarters of all international calls happen on Skype.</v>

1639
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 6>Three quarters,</v>

1640
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 6>three quarters.</v>

1641
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1642
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 6>that's a market that a few,</v>

1643
00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:35.021
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1644
00:50:35.021 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 6>a two decades ago was,</v>

1645
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1646
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.500
<v Speaker 6>15 $20 billion market and disappeared.</v>

1647
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:40.623
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1648
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 6>and essentially they had to restructure operations.</v>

1649
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 6>Now they made up for it.</v>

1650
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:48.970
<v Speaker 6>The smart ones became very good as Internet service providers and created whole</v>

1651
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:50.541
<v Speaker 6>new businesses.</v>

1652
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 6>The replace those lost revenues.</v>

1653
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.880
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1654
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 6>so what happened there is you have these telecom companies trying to fight it</v>

1655
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 6>until some of the smaller ones,</v>

1656
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 6>some of the ones that don't have solid,</v>

1657
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:05.080
<v Speaker 6>entrenched positions and can't take advantage of size.</v>

1658
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:05.691
<v Speaker 6>Think,</v>

1659
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:06.524
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

1660
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.340
<v Speaker 6>maybe I'm going to cut off from this herd and go play with that bitcoin a bit.</v>

1661
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as that starts happening,</v>

1662
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 6>there's almost a stampede because everybody tries to rush into it.</v>

1663
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 6>That's what happens with telecommunications.</v>

1664
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 6>The smaller providers started peeling off from the herd and instead of fighting</v>

1665
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:20.931
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1666
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 6>they started trying to build service providers.</v>

1667
00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:23.480
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1668
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.090
<v Speaker 6>so it's really just a matter of who runs first,</v>

1669
00:51:26.091 --> 00:51:26.241
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1670
00:51:26.241 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 6>Someone's going to start running and then,</v>

1671
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.380
<v Speaker 6>and then the herd breaks apart because until the first one breaks,</v>

1672
00:51:33.381 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 6>everyone's like,</v>

1673
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:34.540
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1674
00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.220
<v Speaker 6>we were too serious for this bitcoin stuff.</v>

1675
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 6>And they're looking over their shoulder trying to make sure that everybody else</v>

1676
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:42.500
<v Speaker 6>is also staying away from it.</v>

1677
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 6>But eventually the market dynamic changes.</v>

1678
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:46.220
<v Speaker 6>So it's just</v>

1679
00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:46.891
<v Speaker 3>essentially,</v>

1680
00:51:46.891 --> 00:51:48.030
<v Speaker 3>it's just human nature,</v>

1681
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.630
<v Speaker 3>like with human nature this to certain rules that are just always going to be</v>

1682
00:51:51.631 --> 00:51:52.464
<v Speaker 3>into place,</v>

1683
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.540
<v Speaker 3>play hard to get and follow the leader.</v>

1684
00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Those are two big ones.</v>

1685
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:56.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1686
00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.530
<v Speaker 6>And bitcoin threatens some business structures within the banking industry.</v>

1687
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 6>It May,</v>

1688
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.650
<v Speaker 6>it's going to make it difficult for them to charge exorbitant fees to do</v>

1689
00:52:05.651 --> 00:52:07.720
<v Speaker 6>international wire transfers when you can do it cheaper.</v>

1690
00:52:07.721 --> 00:52:09.730
<v Speaker 6>Just like if you have Skype,</v>

1691
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.770
<v Speaker 6>you can't justify $3 a minute long distance calls and,</v>

1692
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.270
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time the smart bankers are looking at this and their thing.</v>

1693
00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:19.961
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1694
00:52:19.961 --> 00:52:22.600
<v Speaker 6>But if we have a cheap,</v>

1695
00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:23.261
<v Speaker 6>efficient,</v>

1696
00:52:23.261 --> 00:52:24.580
<v Speaker 6>secure payment system,</v>

1697
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:28.690
<v Speaker 6>we can build some really interesting things on top of that and create whole new</v>

1698
00:52:28.691 --> 00:52:32.170
<v Speaker 6>businesses that are very competitive that can actually give us a lead.</v>

1699
00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:33.030
<v Speaker 6>So we,</v>

1700
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.390
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1701
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.260
<v Speaker 6>Alix run the heard the,</v>

1702
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1703
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.270
<v Speaker 6>disruption in a competitive market is actually very,</v>

1704
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.143
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1705
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.000
<v Speaker 6>very enticing to the,</v>

1706
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.570
<v Speaker 6>to the second and third tier players because they don't have an advantage.</v>

1707
00:52:46.571 --> 00:52:48.580
<v Speaker 6>They're too small to compete against the big guys.</v>

1708
00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:50.770
<v Speaker 6>But if they see this disruptive technology,</v>

1709
00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:50.981
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1710
00:52:50.981 --> 00:52:51.220
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1711
00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.760
<v Speaker 6>maybe if I hit your ride on that I'm going to overtake everybody.</v>

1712
00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:55.840
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1713
00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.860
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1714
00:52:56.861 --> 00:53:00.310
<v Speaker 6>I can be the blockbuster or I can be the Netflix,</v>

1715
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.860
<v Speaker 6>I can be the tower records,</v>

1716
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:04.780
<v Speaker 6>or I can be the iTunes.</v>

1717
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:08.020
<v Speaker 6>And we've seen this happen in technology racist before.</v>

1718
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:08.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1719
00:53:08.591 --> 00:53:10.120
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating how people,</v>

1720
00:53:10.121 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 3>some people just don't want to buck the trends they did.</v>

1721
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:16.540
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to go along with the flow of things or they want to buck the</v>

1722
00:53:16.541 --> 00:53:16.901
<v Speaker 3>trends.</v>

1723
00:53:16.901 --> 00:53:20.160
<v Speaker 3>They want to somehow or another figure out a way where,</v>

1724
00:53:20.161 --> 00:53:20.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1725
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.770
<v Speaker 3>they can prove everybody else wrong and VHS is making a comeback and,</v>

1726
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:24.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1727
00:53:24.251 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 3>renting movies still valid.</v>

1728
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1729
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1730
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.020
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of those fuckers out there that just won't let it go.</v>

1731
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 5>Radio companies change is scary.</v>

1732
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.151
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1733
00:53:33.151 --> 00:53:33.984
<v Speaker 5>That's scary.</v>

1734
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>

1735
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.101
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>

1736
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 5>that's the nature of the beast.</v>

1737
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.430
<v Speaker 5>Especially today.</v>

1738
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 5>We were involved in the craziest time for change.</v>

1739
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 5>The world's ever known.</v>

1740
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:42.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1741
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:43.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1742
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.120
<v Speaker 5>there at the moment,</v>

1743
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 5>being on the top of it and industry,</v>

1744
00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 5>especially an industry that's involved in technology is a very precarious</v>

1745
00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:51.090
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

1746
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1747
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.770
<v Speaker 5>if you talk to,</v>

1748
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.043
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1749
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 5>Kodak a decade ago,</v>

1750
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 5>do you think they would,</v>

1751
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.680
<v Speaker 5>they would realize that suddenly it's the largest vendor or manufacturer of</v>

1752
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 5>cameras in the world would be a telephone company.</v>

1753
00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:09.210
<v Speaker 5>Nokia,</v>

1754
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:09.211
<v Speaker 5>Nokia,</v>

1755
00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:14.211
<v Speaker 5>within three years became the world's largest maker of cameras and suddenly the</v>

1756
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:16.260
<v Speaker 5>entire industry changed.</v>

1757
00:54:16.261 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1758
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 5>And how do you compete against that?</v>

1759
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 5>They're not even in your industry.</v>

1760
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 5>They just came out of left field.</v>

1761
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're suddenly the horse buggy manufacturer and forward is taking</v>

1762
00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 5>your business and you never expected that was going to happen.</v>

1763
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:28.531
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1764
00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Nokia has a camera phone now,</v>

1765
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 5>a windows phone that is some insane amount of pixels.</v>

1766
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 5>It's like 40 fucking megapixels or something,</v>

1767
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.933
<v Speaker 5>something crazy.</v>

1768
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.840
<v Speaker 5>41 41 megapixel says Jamie,</v>

1769
00:54:41.841 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Jamie's on top of that shit.</v>

1770
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.660
<v Speaker 5>41 fucking megapixels on a phone.</v>

1771
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:45.871
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1772
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 5>this thing I think has the note three,</v>

1773
00:54:48.211 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 5>I think it has 12 or something.</v>

1774
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1775
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.290
<v Speaker 5>it's better than that.</v>

1776
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 5>Are you familiar with Moore's law?</v>

1777
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1778
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1779
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:56.191
<v Speaker 5>so for,</v>

1780
00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 5>for your listeners to Moore's law,</v>

1781
00:54:57.751 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 5>it was created by Gordon Moore processors,</v>

1782
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:00.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1783
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 5>Processing speed and yeah,</v>

1784
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:06.600
<v Speaker 5>and what he said was that he estimated that because of the way silicon works</v>

1785
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:08.070
<v Speaker 5>every 18 months,</v>

1786
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 5>the speed of a computer with double or the price would drop by half.</v>

1787
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.530
<v Speaker 5>And that has been true now for more than 25 years.</v>

1788
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1789
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1790
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.810
<v Speaker 5>and that thing then plays out in camera megapixels,</v>

1791
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.780
<v Speaker 5>in storage on SD cards in the size of the,</v>

1792
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.100
<v Speaker 5>of your smartphone,</v>

1793
00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:26.881
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

1794
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:29.740
<v Speaker 5>a number of sensors you can put into the smartphone.</v>

1795
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:30.640
<v Speaker 5>And it's battery.</v>

1796
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 5>Battery life is the one that's lagging behind.</v>

1797
00:55:33.061 --> 00:55:35.640
<v Speaker 5>And it's the main thing that's holding back this technology.</v>

1798
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 5>Moore's law also applies to things like bitcoin.</v>

1799
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 5>It also applies to networks like the Internet.</v>

1800
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 5>And what it means is that if you're in an industry that's established and</v>

1801
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:48.210
<v Speaker 5>suddenly you have a competitor that's coming at you with the power of Moore's</v>

1802
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.020
<v Speaker 5>law,</v>

1803
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:50.830
<v Speaker 5>you better watch out because you're in,</v>

1804
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 5>it's not a matter of whether you will be able to compete in a decade.</v>

1805
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.510
<v Speaker 5>It's a matter of whether your industry will still exist in a decade,</v>

1806
00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:58.930
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1807
00:55:58.930 --> 00:55:59.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1808
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.570
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

1809
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:05.571
<v Speaker 5>That whole industries can just vanish hundred and 50 years of Kodak and then</v>

1810
00:56:05.701 --> 00:56:07.290
<v Speaker 5>suddenly film doesn't exist,</v>

1811
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.450
<v Speaker 5>God and the decade.</v>

1812
00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:12.780
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when you used to have to pay money for long distance?</v>

1813
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 5>Long distance calls don't exist.</v>

1814
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 5>You can call New York right now and your home phone and it's regular call on</v>

1815
00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:20.251
<v Speaker 5>your cell phone.</v>

1816
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 5>It's totally normal.</v>

1817
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 5>Like if you used to call long distance on a cell</v>

1818
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.251
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1819
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it was an exorbitant amount of money.</v>

1820
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 6>Saturday afternoons,</v>

1821
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:28.860
<v Speaker 6>London,</v>

1822
00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 6>painful.</v>

1823
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 6>And when I was a student I would go there with a stack of coins that was</v>

1824
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.520
<v Speaker 6>probably about $10 worth in today's money.</v>

1825
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 6>I would sit in a payphone and my family would know what time I was going to call</v>

1826
00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:41.973
<v Speaker 6>coordinated.</v>

1827
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.000
<v Speaker 6>I'd call in,</v>

1828
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 6>they'd be a line of 15 relatives sitting,</v>

1829
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 6>standing behind the phone on the Athens sides and Avi.</v>

1830
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:49.151
<v Speaker 6>Hi Mom.</v>

1831
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:49.961
<v Speaker 6>I love you very much.</v>

1832
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:50.411
<v Speaker 6>Hi Dad.</v>

1833
00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:51.230
<v Speaker 6>I love you very much,</v>

1834
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.910
<v Speaker 6>Hasis.</v>

1835
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 6>It's all awesome.</v>

1836
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:53.081
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1837
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 6>next ants,</v>

1838
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:55.091
<v Speaker 6>ants,</v>

1839
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:55.924
<v Speaker 6>Maria.</v>

1840
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 6>And you know London's awesome.</v>

1841
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.480
<v Speaker 6>And I'm stuffing coins as fast as I can into this pay phone.</v>

1842
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:02.314
<v Speaker 6>And then you know,</v>

1843
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.690
<v Speaker 6>four or five minutes later,</v>

1844
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.690
<v Speaker 6>$10 down the drain and I've said hello to the entire family and that's all I</v>

1845
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.524
<v Speaker 6>could afford.</v>

1846
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:10.060
<v Speaker 6>That was my experience.</v>

1847
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.380
<v Speaker 6>And now you could Skype for hours for free and not crazy.</v>

1848
00:57:14.381 --> 00:57:15.630
<v Speaker 6>You could look at a video of you</v>

1849
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 2>each other talking to each other through your laptop for free.</v>

1850
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:20.261
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1851
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:21.071
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating,</v>

1852
00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:21.791
<v Speaker 2>fascinating times.</v>

1853
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 2>And when you put it in that kind of a perspective,</v>

1854
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 2>you really sort of understand that change.</v>

1855
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:26.943
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

1856
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 2>the ability that we have to reach out to each other is just unprecedented in</v>

1857
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:32.501
<v Speaker 2>human history.</v>

1858
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 2>It's never been even remotely close to what it is now.</v>

1859
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I saw somebody walking down the street the other day,</v>

1860
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 2>skyping with someone while they were walking down the street and they were</v>

1861
00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:41.770
<v Speaker 2>talking while they're walking down the street.</v>

1862
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:42.011
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1863
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:42.251
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1864
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 2>so we're gonna,</v>

1865
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:42.971
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1866
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:43.141
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1867
00:57:43.141 --> 00:57:43.690
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1868
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 2>And then the other person's on the other end.</v>

1869
00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at their phone.</v>

1870
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1871
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:47.411
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

1872
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it through a cell phone connection.</v>

1873
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing that all the time now.</v>

1874
00:57:50.461 --> 00:57:51.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1875
00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Walking down the street through a cell phone connection,</v>

1876
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.490
<v Speaker 2>streaming video back and forth to each other.</v>

1877
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.353
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1878
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.193
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1879
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about things like,</v>

1880
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:05.290
<v Speaker 2>is there a reason why apple doesn't have any apps where you can exchange</v>

1881
00:58:05.931 --> 00:58:06.560
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin?</v>

1882
00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.140
<v Speaker 2>They have some bitcoin monitoring apps,</v>

1883
00:58:09.141 --> 00:58:09.890
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

1884
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:10.180
<v Speaker 6>They've,</v>

1885
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:14.850
<v Speaker 6>they've basically banned any apps that allow you to run a wallet to do</v>

1886
00:58:14.851 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 6>transactions.</v>

1887
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Is there a reason for that?</v>

1888
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:17.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1889
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 2>is there like,</v>

1890
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:23.170
<v Speaker 2>can you find a lug a logical if you try to take devil's advocate?</v>

1891
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1892
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:23.640
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

1893
00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.510
<v Speaker 6>there's three or four reasons and I can give you them from the obvious to the,</v>

1894
00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.310
<v Speaker 6>to the cynical and paranoid.</v>

1895
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:30.623
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1896
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.033
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

1897
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:37.880
<v Speaker 6>I think they are worried about this strange technology that they don't know</v>

1898
00:58:38.221 --> 00:58:41.610
<v Speaker 6>anything about and they're worried about what kind of reputation hit they'll</v>

1899
00:58:41.611 --> 00:58:43.740
<v Speaker 6>take if one of these apps is compromised,</v>

1900
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.090
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1901
00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:47.310
<v Speaker 6>and causes their customers to lose money.</v>

1902
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:48.413
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1903
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm more worried then Google who allow all of these applications on Google play.</v>

1904
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.660
<v Speaker 6>So it's not a legal thing because Google has lawyers too and they're quite happy</v>

1905
00:58:57.661 --> 00:59:00.270
<v Speaker 6>to allow bitcoin applications and apple does not like it.</v>

1906
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.190
<v Speaker 6>That's the obvious answer.</v>

1907
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.473
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1908
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 6>there's another thing when whenever you spend money on buying an APP or buying</v>

1909
00:59:09.031 --> 00:59:10.290
<v Speaker 6>something inside the nap,</v>

1910
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.240
<v Speaker 6>apple takes like 30%</v>

1911
00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:13.870
<v Speaker 2>mm.</v>

1912
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 6>So their own payment system through the APP store and iTunes and all of these</v>

1913
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:22.580
<v Speaker 6>things generates an enormous amount of revenue because they take a very big cut</v>

1914
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.503
<v Speaker 6>of these things.</v>

1915
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.710
<v Speaker 6>If you could put a wallet in a phone,</v>

1916
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.250
<v Speaker 6>then you could also put a wallet in an APP.</v>

1917
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 6>Then you could also do bitcoin transactions in an APP.</v>

1918
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:35.351
<v Speaker 6>Then why give apple 30% cut if you can just bypass them and do all the payments</v>

1919
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:37.124
<v Speaker 6>through that?</v>

1920
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.240
<v Speaker 2>That's ultimately going to be apples demise though.</v>

1921
00:59:40.241 --> 00:59:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at it,</v>

1922
00:59:41.231 --> 00:59:44.050
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about like people that had a grip on a market and then it</v>

1923
00:59:44.051 --> 00:59:45.250
<v Speaker 2>slowly slipped away.</v>

1924
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Apple had an enormous chunk of the smartphone market just a few years ago.</v>

1925
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:51.011
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1926
00:59:51.011 --> 00:59:56.011
<v Speaker 2>they had the majority of it now 80 something percent of the smart phones or</v>

1927
00:59:56.081 --> 00:59:56.914
<v Speaker 2>android phones.</v>

1928
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.240
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1929
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

1930
00:59:58.731 --> 00:59:59.950
<v Speaker 2>that's quite amazing.</v>

1931
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.590
<v Speaker 2>And the technology has surpassed them.</v>

1932
01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Now you have several choices with android phones that are waterproof,</v>

1933
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.710
<v Speaker 2>big giant ones as Sony Experia you could throw it underwater for a fucking half</v>

1934
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.860
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>

1935
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.080
<v Speaker 2>like five feet of water for half an hour.</v>

1936
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:14.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1937
01:00:14.921 --> 01:00:16.540
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy s five,</v>

1938
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:17.200
<v Speaker 2>the new one,</v>

1939
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.070
<v Speaker 2>water resistant.</v>

1940
01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You could take a shower with it and listen to music.</v>

1941
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.640
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1942
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you could put a fucking stuff it in your underwear and literally shower with the</v>

1943
01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:25.361
<v Speaker 2>thing on.</v>

1944
01:00:25.361 --> 01:00:26.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1945
01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.700
<v Speaker 2>fingerprint sensors,</v>

1946
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.560
<v Speaker 2>they had them first on iPhones,</v>

1947
01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.450
<v Speaker 2>but now Samsung galaxies,</v>

1948
01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:33.850
<v Speaker 2>a s five has a fucking heart rate monitor.</v>

1949
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:34.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1950
01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:35.051
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1951
01:00:35.051 --> 01:00:35.770
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

1952
01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:36.970
<v Speaker 2>they're ahead of the curve.</v>

1953
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.641
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

1954
01:00:37.641 --> 01:00:41.530
<v Speaker 2>the android phones aren't playing catch up with apple anymore.</v>

1955
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Now they're bypassing him.</v>

1956
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder if that's going to happen with things like iTunes,</v>

1957
01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>the exchanges,</v>

1958
01:00:48.341 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1959
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Right now it's convenient to use iTunes.</v>

1960
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.380
<v Speaker 2>But once I switched over to Android,</v>

1961
01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1962
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I found a thing called double twist where you could send your music to your</v>

1963
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.660
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1964
01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you can use iTunes with this thing.</v>

1965
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:04.300
<v Speaker 2>And also I found Amazon Mp3,</v>

1966
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.340
<v Speaker 2>which is just as easy to use,</v>

1967
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:07.510
<v Speaker 2>if not easier.</v>

1968
01:01:07.511 --> 01:01:08.344
<v Speaker 2>Then iTunes.</v>

1969
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.350
<v Speaker 6>I changed as a horrible application.</v>

1970
01:01:10.351 --> 01:01:11.220
<v Speaker 6>I can't stand it.</v>

1971
01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:15.570
<v Speaker 6>It's like you put it on your Mac and you get a pinwheel every time you click on</v>

1972
01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:16.350
<v Speaker 6>anything,</v>

1973
01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:18.120
<v Speaker 6>especially if you have a large collection,</v>

1974
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:18.751
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1975
01:01:18.751 --> 01:01:21.900
<v Speaker 6>and it hasn't really changed or improved much at all.</v>

1976
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.650
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1977
01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:27.150
<v Speaker 6>but it does ask you to accept the terms and conditions every time you sneeze.</v>

1978
01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.110
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1979
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.580
<v Speaker 6>so you have to click on that thing.</v>

1980
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.270
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1981
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.103
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

1982
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:31.830
<v Speaker 6>apple,</v>

1983
01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:33.660
<v Speaker 6>I've accepted the terms.</v>

1984
01:01:33.661 --> 01:01:34.494
<v Speaker 6>I haven't read them,</v>

1985
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.400
<v Speaker 6>no one's read them,</v>

1986
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.391
<v Speaker 6>but I accept them.</v>

1987
01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:37.410
<v Speaker 6>I accept them forever.</v>

1988
01:01:37.411 --> 01:01:39.600
<v Speaker 6>Just give me a checkbox that says from now on,</v>

1989
01:01:39.601 --> 01:01:41.010
<v Speaker 6>until the end of time,</v>

1990
01:01:41.011 --> 01:01:41.844
<v Speaker 6>I accept,</v>

1991
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:42.930
<v Speaker 6>I accept.</v>

1992
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:43.853
<v Speaker 6>Please.</v>

1993
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:45.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Do a retina scan every time I look at your APP,</v>

1995
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.670
<v Speaker 2>as soon I'm accepting.</v>

1996
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1997
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I like iTunes for some things.</v>

1998
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>I use it still to buy movies.</v>

1999
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I use it on my laptop exclusively.</v>

2000
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I use it on my home computer exclusively.</v>

2001
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm buying music,</v>

2002
01:02:00.321 --> 01:02:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I buy my music and I buy it off through that.</v>

2003
01:02:02.811 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>But on my phone it's just as easy to buy it through Amazon.</v>

2004
01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:07.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very simple.</v>

2005
01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:07.971
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2006
01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not like some new thing you have to learn.</v>

2007
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Same process.</v>

2008
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 2>You search a genre search an artist,</v>

2009
01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>oh I wanted to buy like we were in the green room the other day if the Orlando</v>

2010
01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:17.391
<v Speaker 2>hard rock,</v>

2011
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 2>me and Joey Diaz and Joey Diaz goes on this epic rant about led Zeppelin as led</v>

2012
01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Zeppelin one cause there was a poster on the wall that I took a picture of and I</v>

2013
01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:30.840
<v Speaker 2>put it up on my Instagram and it was the first tour poster from led Zeppelin in</v>

2014
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:33.210
<v Speaker 2>1968 69 and we were like,</v>

2015
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 2>could you fucking imagine what that must have been like to experience like</v>

2016
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Zeplin for the first time?</v>

2017
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:39.871
<v Speaker 2>Like back then,</v>

2018
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 2>like any jelly was going off about how it blew people away.</v>

2019
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>So listening to him,</v>

2020
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I get inspired.</v>

2021
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I go to my phone as he's talking within like 10 seconds,</v>

2022
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I type led Zeppelin in the search.</v>

2023
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

2024
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.610
<v Speaker 2>it's downloading.</v>

2025
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Three seconds after that,</v>

2026
01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

2027
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing the album.</v>

2028
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

2029
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2030
01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.940
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

2031
01:02:59.941 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I put it on speaker,</v>

2032
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>we sit down and we start laughing about how easy that is to do and how amazing</v>

2033
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:06.084
<v Speaker 2>this music is.</v>

2034
01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:06.971
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2035
01:03:06.971 --> 01:03:07.151
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2036
01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:07.631
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

2037
01:03:07.631 --> 01:03:08.500
<v Speaker 6>I apple,</v>

2038
01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:09.520
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2039
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.380
<v Speaker 6>change the way we think about music,</v>

2040
01:03:11.381 --> 01:03:13.360
<v Speaker 6>change the way we think about phones,</v>

2041
01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.200
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2042
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.120
<v Speaker 6>and created all of these new technologies.</v>

2043
01:03:16.121 --> 01:03:16.954
<v Speaker 6>But here's the,</v>

2044
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.950
<v Speaker 6>this happens again,</v>

2045
01:03:17.951 --> 01:03:19.300
<v Speaker 6>again in technology as part of the,</v>

2046
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.680
<v Speaker 6>let me give you the context.</v>

2047
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.151
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2048
01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:24.960
<v Speaker 2>iTunes stores not loading right now just to show you pinwheel.</v>

2049
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's been willing right now.</v>

2050
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I clicked it as you,</v>

2051
01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:29.670
<v Speaker 2>as you brought that up.</v>

2052
01:03:29.671 --> 01:03:29.971
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2053
01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:30.770
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

2054
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:31.351
<v Speaker 2>And I clicked it.</v>

2055
01:03:31.351 --> 01:03:32.400
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking not loading.</v>

2056
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.560
<v Speaker 2>So what happens with technology</v>

2057
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:40.420
<v Speaker 6>again and again is that you always have to make this trade off.</v>

2058
01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:45.070
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to have an experience that's very tightly controlled and therefore</v>

2059
01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:45.910
<v Speaker 6>consistent,</v>

2060
01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:46.271
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2061
01:03:46.271 --> 01:03:48.640
<v Speaker 6>You combine a very limited set of hardware,</v>

2062
01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:50.230
<v Speaker 6>very limited set of features.</v>

2063
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.650
<v Speaker 6>But what you get is that it works every time consistently.</v>

2064
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:58.120
<v Speaker 6>And then you can have this kind of wild west situation as you do with android.</v>

2065
01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:02.530
<v Speaker 6>And at first it creates a lot of fragmentation and everything's inconsistent and</v>

2066
01:04:02.531 --> 01:04:03.610
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't work very well.</v>

2067
01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:04.990
<v Speaker 6>But over time,</v>

2068
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:05.980
<v Speaker 6>here's what happens.</v>

2069
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:09.910
<v Speaker 6>The controlled situation that gave you the advantage at first starts lagging</v>

2070
01:04:09.911 --> 01:04:14.770
<v Speaker 6>behind innovation because it can't change fast enough and the wild west starts</v>

2071
01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:19.060
<v Speaker 6>getting better and better at quality until eventually it wins.</v>

2072
01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.000
<v Speaker 6>And we've seen this happen over time.</v>

2073
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.240
<v Speaker 6>And then the,</v>

2074
01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:26.050
<v Speaker 6>the control situation has to open up the borders again.</v>

2075
01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:27.610
<v Speaker 6>Let everybody flood in,</v>

2076
01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.820
<v Speaker 6>do a lot of fragmentation and experimentation and the cycle starts again.</v>

2077
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:32.560
<v Speaker 6>That's going to happen to,</v>

2078
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.610
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2079
01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.770
<v Speaker 6>we're going to see much more openness and music.</v>

2080
01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:38.140
<v Speaker 6>We're going to see more openness and phones as a result of this.</v>

2081
01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:41.500
<v Speaker 6>And then apple will have to actually go out and invent something new.</v>

2082
01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.370
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2083
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:43.300
<v Speaker 6>instead of just,</v>

2084
01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2085
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:45.940
<v Speaker 6>small incremental changes,</v>

2086
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.591
<v Speaker 8>oh shit,</v>

2087
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.490
<v Speaker 8>it's bothering you,</v>

2088
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:48.140
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

2089
01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.620
<v Speaker 8>bothering me and bothering me.</v>

2090
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.951
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>

2091
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:51.000
<v Speaker 8>It's 52%,</v>

2092
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:51.211
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2093
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:53.610
<v Speaker 8>android and 41% uh,</v>

2094
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:54.480
<v Speaker 8>is uh,</v>

2095
01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:57.240
<v Speaker 8>apple is that you went to Reno was 80.</v>

2096
01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:02.580
<v Speaker 8>That's a red 80 somewhere and a apple still has sold more a applications.</v>

2097
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:04.141
<v Speaker 8>It's a,</v>

2098
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 8>apple has sold 50 APP,</v>

2099
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.220
<v Speaker 8>50 million apps I think or something like that.</v>

2100
01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:09.061
<v Speaker 8>An android,</v>

2101
01:05:09.061 --> 01:05:11.100
<v Speaker 8>it's up to 48 million apps.</v>

2102
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:11.670
<v Speaker 8>Total soul.</v>

2103
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:12.720
<v Speaker 8>What's bothering you about it?</v>

2104
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:14.853
<v Speaker 8>Man?</v>

2105
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.370
<v Speaker 2>81% man on cnet.</v>

2106
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Cnet says android dominates 81% of the world's smart phone market.</v>

2107
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:19.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2108
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>that's the global versus I think what you quoted as us and it's a very different</v>

2109
01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

2110
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2111
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2112
01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Well let's look at it globally.</v>

2113
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:26.943
<v Speaker 2>So Asia,</v>

2114
01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 2>much bigger android penetration.</v>

2115
01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.161
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2116
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what I read.</v>

2117
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:34.500
<v Speaker 8>I was in Vancouver this weekend and I had to use my android phone completely.</v>

2118
01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:36.720
<v Speaker 8>Only using my android phone note.</v>

2119
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:37.710
<v Speaker 8>No iPhone at all.</v>

2120
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:38.783
<v Speaker 8>And it,</v>

2121
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:43.850
<v Speaker 8>I do not understand people that say that the android phone is better in any way.</v>

2122
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.300
<v Speaker 8>The camera was horrible.</v>

2123
01:05:45.301 --> 01:05:48.690
<v Speaker 8>I tried to take so many photos using that camera and this is the note three that</v>

2124
01:05:48.691 --> 01:05:50.250
<v Speaker 8>has like a really nice camera.</v>

2125
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:51.870
<v Speaker 8>That camera is a piece of shit.</v>

2126
01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:52.330
<v Speaker 8>All,</v>

2127
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:57.090
<v Speaker 8>all Samsung does is add a bunch of crap to their phones to be the first,</v>

2128
01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:00.830
<v Speaker 8>but they do it so halfassed that it just doesn't work like that.</v>

2129
01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.830
<v Speaker 8>Like you keep on taking this heartbeat sensor and that the thumbprint thing is</v>

2130
01:06:04.831 --> 01:06:05.960
<v Speaker 8>one of the worst input.</v>

2131
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.940
<v Speaker 8>The thumbprint and the new s five is horrible.</v>

2132
01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.620
<v Speaker 8>People are saying it's the dumbest thing ever,</v>

2133
01:06:10.621 --> 01:06:12.000
<v Speaker 8>that it never works.</v>

2134
01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.230
<v Speaker 8>It's just a piece of shit.</v>

2135
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.790
<v Speaker 8>Well that's exactly the compromise.</v>

2136
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.010
<v Speaker 8>You need to have control and tight quality,</v>

2137
01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:19.380
<v Speaker 8>but it's slow or you have speed,</v>

2138
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:19.920
<v Speaker 8>but it's,</v>

2139
01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.551
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

2140
01:06:20.551 --> 01:06:20.970
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2141
01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:22.980
<v Speaker 8>at first it's flaky.</v>

2142
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:23.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2143
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.470
<v Speaker 8>And I'd be the first director say,</v>

2144
01:06:25.471 --> 01:06:25.681
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

2145
01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.331
<v Speaker 8>you're right at,</v>

2146
01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:26.760
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2147
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.290
<v Speaker 8>this iPhone is a piece of shit.</v>

2148
01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:33.210
<v Speaker 8>I still buy all the newest phones just because I'm looking just like everyone</v>

2149
01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:34.110
<v Speaker 8>else to find something better.</v>

2150
01:06:34.111 --> 01:06:34.531
<v Speaker 8>But man,</v>

2151
01:06:34.531 --> 01:06:34.910
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2152
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:36.990
<v Speaker 8>you can't break this thing being quality.</v>

2153
01:06:36.991 --> 01:06:38.160
<v Speaker 8>Like it's always working.</v>

2154
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.350
<v Speaker 8>You had the best photos you can possibly get.</v>

2155
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:42.120
<v Speaker 8>All the APPS are perfect.</v>

2156
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I definitely agree with you on the photos.</v>

2157
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.700
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference between the iPhone photos and the,</v>

2158
01:06:47.701 --> 01:06:47.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2159
01:06:47.821 --> 01:06:48.690
<v Speaker 2>android photos.</v>

2160
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I think the sensor,</v>

2161
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:50.551
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2162
01:06:50.551 --> 01:06:51.000
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2163
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:51.331
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2164
01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:54.960
<v Speaker 2>the sensor on the iPhone is a lower megapixel but much higher quality.</v>

2165
01:06:54.961 --> 01:06:56.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just a better phone.</v>

2166
01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:57.031
<v Speaker 2>But I'm like,</v>

2167
01:06:57.031 --> 01:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>what does it mega pixel on the iPhone.</v>

2168
01:06:58.321 --> 01:06:59.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like eight,</v>

2169
01:06:59.010 --> 01:06:59.400
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

2170
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

2171
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2172
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>forget lenses and things like that make a huge different Carl Zeiss Lens.</v>

2173
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:05.191
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2174
01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:10.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm back like it's actually 13 megapixels on the galaxy note three.</v>

2175
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2176
01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:12.210
<v Speaker 2>But it's not as good.</v>

2177
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:12.691
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2178
01:07:12.691 --> 01:07:14.820
<v Speaker 2>it's fine if the light is good.</v>

2179
01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:15.773
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking Jamie?</v>

2180
01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:16.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2181
01:07:16.021 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a microphone on you motherfucker.</v>

2182
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.413
<v Speaker 2>I can't hear you.</v>

2183
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:19.350
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

2184
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you make sign language at me?</v>

2185
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:21.913
<v Speaker 2>I can't hear that either.</v>

2186
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:23.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2187
01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:23.611
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2188
01:07:23.611 --> 01:07:24.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2189
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.193
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2190
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think there is a better camera than the iPhone,</v>

2191
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the note three.</v>

2192
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:30.923
<v Speaker 2>I think there is,</v>

2193
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.610
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure there is a better camera,</v>

2194
01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.473
<v Speaker 8>but I'm just saying,</v>

2195
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.050
<v Speaker 2>let's find out what's the best.</v>

2196
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's Google best smart phone camera.</v>

2197
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I bet apples in the top two.</v>

2198
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:43.690
<v Speaker 8>There was also reports saying that you know why it's such a big share is not</v>

2199
01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 8>because of quality.</v>

2200
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 8>It's because of price that that android users are more poor and they get more</v>

2201
01:07:49.181 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 8>technology for the money.</v>

2202
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 8>So that's why it's become so popular because all the poor markets are buying it.</v>

2203
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:56.860
<v Speaker 8>So it looks like Android's just destroying apple in that,</v>

2204
01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:57.551
<v Speaker 8>that regards.</v>

2205
01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:59.260
<v Speaker 8>But it's not meaning that it's a better</v>

2206
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:00.090
<v Speaker 2>products.</v>

2207
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Smartphone camera overall iPhone five s it's the mass market audience,</v>

2208
01:08:05.431 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 2>especially in in Asia where you can get an android phone for 50 to $100 instead</v>

2209
01:08:10.021 --> 01:08:15.021
<v Speaker 2>of three to $400 equivalent for iPhone image stabilization and dual led flash.</v>

2210
01:08:17.311 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 2>She got one of the best phones for taking pictures in low light or any</v>

2211
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:21.261
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2212
01:08:21.261 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Apple has improved its camera app for the five s what's the difference?</v>

2213
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh it does like photos.</v>

2214
01:08:27.141 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>There's slow Mo.</v>

2215
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:29.610
<v Speaker 8>One of the coolest things,</v>

2216
01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:32.130
<v Speaker 8>I think you could do this on the android offsites burst mode but,</v>

2217
01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.860
<v Speaker 8>but being able to adjust and I didn't even know I had it.</v>

2218
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:36.600
<v Speaker 8>If you just hold down the camera,</v>

2219
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.370
<v Speaker 8>it just takes a million photos.</v>

2220
01:08:38.371 --> 01:08:40.890
<v Speaker 8>So like if you're like with like say like you want a picture of Joe Rogan,</v>

2221
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.940
<v Speaker 8>you just sit there,</v>

2222
01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:46.860
<v Speaker 8>hold down the camera it was and take like 300 photos and then you can just</v>

2223
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 8>choose which one you didn't blink and stuff.</v>

2224
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:49.040
<v Speaker 8>Like</v>

2225
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I do miss the camera.</v>

2226
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing I missed.</v>

2227
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:52.260
<v Speaker 2>But I don't miss that little bitch.</v>

2228
01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 2>He screen screens a Joe June.</v>

2229
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:55.850
<v Speaker 2>That's all you have to wait.</v>

2230
01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:56.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2231
01:08:56.121 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>

2232
01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 2>But that's a 4.71 the 5.51 is not going to be for a long time.</v>

2233
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.303
<v Speaker 2>It's September.</v>

2234
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.541
<v Speaker 2>So says you,</v>

2235
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:04.130
<v Speaker 2>what are you a Mac insider?</v>

2236
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:04.690
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

2237
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you know</v>

2238
01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:07.170
<v Speaker 8>why in this humongous iPads coming out?</v>

2239
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2240
01:09:07.771 --> 01:09:08.640
<v Speaker 2>that's all good dude.</v>

2241
01:09:08.641 --> 01:09:09.840
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>

2242
01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it every day.</v>

2243
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that all day.</v>

2244
01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:13.261
<v Speaker 2>It's not important.</v>

2245
01:09:13.261 --> 01:09:16.380
<v Speaker 2>The camera's not nearly as important to me as being able to do my email,</v>

2246
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.460
<v Speaker 2>go online.</v>

2247
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Everything plays like flash.</v>

2248
01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Anything that has flash on it plays no problem.</v>

2249
01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2250
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>that to me is gigantic.</v>

2251
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.190
<v Speaker 2>When I look at a youtube video and it's that Goddamn big to me that's huge.</v>

2252
01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>And also the stylists.</v>

2253
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love this thing.</v>

2254
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

2255
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2256
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.573
<v Speaker 8>I never use it.</v>

2257
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.670
<v Speaker 8>Every time I use the style was like I'm just wasting my time.</v>

2258
01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:37.030
<v Speaker 8>Why am I,</v>

2259
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.830
<v Speaker 8>why am I doing this?</v>

2260
01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

2261
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I use it a lot for writing my jokes.</v>

2262
01:09:40.681 --> 01:09:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2263
01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:41.230
<v Speaker 8>That's,</v>

2264
01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:43.270
<v Speaker 8>that's interesting that you do that too because that's,</v>

2265
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.470
<v Speaker 8>it seems so much.</v>

2266
01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:45.251
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

2267
01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:46.810
<v Speaker 8>Like I'm just so fast on the keyboard.</v>

2268
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:47.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not the fast thing for me it's a memorization thing.</v>

2270
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:53.580
<v Speaker 2>When you actually write things physically with your hand,</v>

2271
01:09:53.581 --> 01:09:54.990
<v Speaker 2>you can remember them better.</v>

2272
01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:58.050
<v Speaker 2>And this took I for a long time.</v>

2273
01:09:58.051 --> 01:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I was still bringing the notebook as well,</v>

2274
01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.530
<v Speaker 2>but I gave up on the notebook.</v>

2275
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I do it all on this thing now.</v>

2276
01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.300
<v Speaker 8>I thought you meant since this Ipod,</v>

2277
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:04.841
<v Speaker 8>iPad,</v>

2278
01:10:04.841 --> 01:10:05.051
<v Speaker 8>air.</v>

2279
01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:08.680
<v Speaker 8>I've been taking my iPad almost everywhere and now I don't give a shit about my</v>

2280
01:10:08.681 --> 01:10:08.981
<v Speaker 8>phone.</v>

2281
01:10:08.981 --> 01:10:09.850
<v Speaker 8>This is just for texting.</v>

2282
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.380
<v Speaker 8>You meet pad or my eye,</v>

2283
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:12.303
<v Speaker 8>my iPad,</v>

2284
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:12.910
<v Speaker 8>my iPad.</v>

2285
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:13.660
<v Speaker 8>Air pod.</v>

2286
01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.140
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.530
<v Speaker 8>This thing is so light and like you could just keep it everywhere and like if</v>

2288
01:10:17.531 --> 01:10:18.700
<v Speaker 8>you really want to surf the net,</v>

2289
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.780
<v Speaker 8>you know even the new one,</v>

2290
01:10:19.781 --> 01:10:20.614
<v Speaker 8>the small one.</v>

2291
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:21.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2292
01:10:21.981 --> 01:10:22.970
<v Speaker 2>that is a good move.</v>

2293
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:24.830
<v Speaker 2>But you can't put it in your pocket.</v>

2294
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.440
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2295
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:25.951
<v Speaker 8>I don't just,</v>

2296
01:10:25.951 --> 01:10:26.041
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2297
01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:26.311
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2298
01:10:26.311 --> 01:10:27.970
<v Speaker 8>I honestly just don't trust the,</v>

2299
01:10:27.971 --> 01:10:28.331
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2300
01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:32.740
<v Speaker 8>the apps in the APP store and the Google apps and the back doors and the hacking</v>

2301
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.100
<v Speaker 8>hackability of the operating system.</v>

2302
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:35.581
<v Speaker 8>To me,</v>

2303
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:38.700
<v Speaker 8>I think this is the way the iPhone is just a brick and then see it like your</v>

2304
01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:39.534
<v Speaker 8>important stuff,</v>

2305
01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.070
<v Speaker 8>the text messages and your,</v>

2306
01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:44.620
<v Speaker 8>your crap like that should have the highest security and not something that</v>

2307
01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:46.350
<v Speaker 8>that's so easily been hacked.</v>

2308
01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:46.740
<v Speaker 8>So</v>

2309
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.401
<v Speaker 7>right here,</v>

2310
01:10:47.401 --> 01:10:50.010
<v Speaker 7>this comparison between control,</v>

2311
01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:51.030
<v Speaker 7>quality,</v>

2312
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:54.210
<v Speaker 7>but slow innovation versus speed choice,</v>

2313
01:10:54.211 --> 01:10:55.050
<v Speaker 7>fragmentation,</v>

2314
01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:58.680
<v Speaker 7>but flakiness and weird security problems and cutting edge,</v>

2315
01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:03.510
<v Speaker 7>that choice is playing out in many areas of technology,</v>

2316
01:11:03.511 --> 01:11:04.344
<v Speaker 7>whether it's and,</v>

2317
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.510
<v Speaker 7>and this choice played out on the Internet for at first,</v>

2318
01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:11.430
<v Speaker 7>which was the idea that the Internet was a far inferior network to the carefully</v>

2319
01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:12.330
<v Speaker 7>controlled,</v>

2320
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:13.140
<v Speaker 7>if you like it,</v>

2321
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.690
<v Speaker 7>phone companies were doing the iPhone of networks,</v>

2322
01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2323
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 7>And the Internet was like the scrappy mess.</v>

2324
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 7>See android of networks.</v>

2325
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:26.151
<v Speaker 7>But over time it continued to innovate and get better and the other systems got</v>

2326
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:29.760
<v Speaker 7>slower and slower and less innovative.</v>

2327
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 7>And so the closest items have that problem.</v>

2328
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:33.834
<v Speaker 7>They lag,</v>

2329
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 7>but they offer you much better control and quality and security at first.</v>

2330
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.150
<v Speaker 7>So here's the thing that's been happening in finance and in finance,</v>

2331
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:47.151
<v Speaker 7>it's much worse because the closed control systems of the banks have existed for</v>

2332
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 7>hundreds of years.</v>

2333
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 7>And this scrappy new bitcoin thing,</v>

2334
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 7>which is not as fast in many cases,</v>

2335
01:11:57.001 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 7>but fast and other cases has more choice but also puts more responsibility for</v>

2336
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:01.411
<v Speaker 7>security.</v>

2337
01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 7>It's more flaky,</v>

2338
01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 7>it's more scrappy,</v>

2339
01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 7>it's more versatile.</v>

2340
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:08.190
<v Speaker 7>It gives you a hell of a lot more choice and it allows you to innovate really,</v>

2341
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:09.024
<v Speaker 7>really fast,</v>

2342
01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 7>doesn't give you the quality.</v>

2343
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 7>You don't have the,</v>

2344
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.351
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2345
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 7>the controls and security supposedly,</v>

2346
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.460
<v Speaker 7>but then at the same time,</v>

2347
01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:21.150
<v Speaker 7>the banking system is failing to deliver to consumers.</v>

2348
01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:24.570
<v Speaker 7>It's failing to deliver security because people can get away with massive theft</v>

2349
01:12:24.571 --> 01:12:25.380
<v Speaker 7>on it.</v>

2350
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:30.150
<v Speaker 7>And so now what we're seeing is this exact same scenario that you described that</v>

2351
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 7>we saw with the Internet versus telecom networks that we saw with iPhone versus</v>

2352
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 7>android is now playing out in finance with bitcoin.</v>

2353
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:37.950
<v Speaker 7>That's fascinating.</v>

2354
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:39.180
<v Speaker 7>They say that the best</v>

2355
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:42.900
<v Speaker 3>a camera for power users is that Nokia,</v>

2356
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Nokia,</v>

2357
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.570
<v Speaker 3>they had 'em on Tom's guide.</v>

2358
01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>

2359
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 3>When I'm reading a,</v>

2360
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 3>they've rated a bunch of different ones.</v>

2361
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why Tom Really knows his shit,</v>

2362
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.000
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like a highly rated side.</v>

2363
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.670
<v Speaker 3>But the 41 megapixel camera apparently just,</v>

2364
01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:57.870
<v Speaker 3>it's just unbelievable.</v>

2365
01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:58.250
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

2366
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.510
<v Speaker 3>The photos are so big that a,</v>

2367
01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.710
<v Speaker 3>even when you zoom in like way in like you could take a photo and zoom way in,</v>

2368
01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 3>it's still crop it and it's still an excellent photo.</v>

2369
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:07.441
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2370
01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:10.740
<v Speaker 8>That's about the only reason why you'd want that meeting megapixels though.</v>

2371
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:11.790
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2372
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:13.120
<v Speaker 8>Because I'm mega pixels,</v>

2373
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:17.310
<v Speaker 8>people stopped caring about megapixels a while ago for the most part.</v>

2374
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 8>Even some of the higher end cameras has kind of stopped.</v>

2375
01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:21.660
<v Speaker 8>Even though they could go bigger they,</v>

2376
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:25.620
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's just not as important as it when it was like from one mega pixel</v>

2377
01:13:25.621 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 8>that five megapixels,</v>

2378
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.380
<v Speaker 8>unless you're making like billboards,</v>

2379
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.740
<v Speaker 8>unless you're making billboards or you really are just going to spend time just</v>

2380
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:36.030
<v Speaker 8>cropping out sections of large photos and even that with a such a small device</v>

2381
01:13:36.031 --> 01:13:36.841
<v Speaker 8>that's in your hand.</v>

2382
01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:40.530
<v Speaker 8>I would imagine that there's a lot of blur and even if you do crop out little</v>

2383
01:13:40.531 --> 01:13:40.921
<v Speaker 8>pieces,</v>

2384
01:13:40.921 --> 01:13:44.790
<v Speaker 8>it's still not going to be like something like if you had a tripod and a DSLR or</v>

2385
01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:45.250
<v Speaker 8>something.</v>

2386
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2387
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:49.570
<v Speaker 3>They're saying that the galaxy s five is a big improvement too from the note</v>

2388
01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:51.190
<v Speaker 3>three as far as cameras go.</v>

2389
01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2391
01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:55.180
<v Speaker 7>You get to a point of saturation where it becomes good enough.</v>

2392
01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:59.020
<v Speaker 7>You'll remember the time when you bought a computer based on how many gigahertz</v>

2393
01:13:59.021 --> 01:14:00.700
<v Speaker 7>it had and how fast it wasn't.</v>

2394
01:14:00.701 --> 01:14:04.540
<v Speaker 7>You needed to upgrade every year and then we reached a point probably five or</v>

2395
01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:08.110
<v Speaker 7>six years ago when you bought a computer and then it was still perfectly fast</v>

2396
01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:11.050
<v Speaker 7>enough for five years later and you didn't need to upgrade it.</v>

2397
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2398
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 7>Or when you use the needs a bigger and bigger hard drive every single year and</v>

2399
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 7>then you race the tower by and I are like,</v>

2400
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:17.111
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2401
01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 7>I can store everything so I'm done.</v>

2402
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 7>I don't need anymore.</v>

2403
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:20.560
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2404
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 7>Same thing with megapixels.</v>

2405
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 7>You reach a point where at first it makes a really big difference and then it's</v>

2406
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 7>such a small difference that it doesn't matter anymore.</v>

2407
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.280
<v Speaker 7>You've reached saturation,</v>

2408
01:14:30.281 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 7>you have to find something else to emphasize.</v>

2409
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:34.150
<v Speaker 7>Some new innovation.</v>

2410
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:35.343
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:14:35.621 --> 01:14:36.420
<v Speaker 3>At a certain point,</v>

2413
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Time's going to be very difficult for one company,</v>

2414
01:14:38.851 --> 01:14:43.050
<v Speaker 3>like a company like apple to compete with the overwhelming amount of companies</v>

2415
01:14:43.051 --> 01:14:44.850
<v Speaker 3>that are producing android phones.</v>

2416
01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:46.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the open ecosystem.</v>

2417
01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between being able to innovate and multiple places versus</v>

2418
01:14:50.281 --> 01:14:53.430
<v Speaker 3>trying to control everything and you can really see that too if you pay</v>

2419
01:14:53.431 --> 01:14:57.420
<v Speaker 3>attention to the original android phones and what they are today as opposed to</v>

2420
01:14:57.421 --> 01:14:58.530
<v Speaker 3>the original iPhone,</v>

2421
01:14:58.531 --> 01:14:59.820
<v Speaker 3>which was incredibly innovative,</v>

2422
01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:04.050
<v Speaker 3>like the original iPhone is pretty close to what they have today.</v>

2423
01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was very similar in size.</v>

2424
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Very similar in look.</v>

2425
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:10.200
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the resolution got better,</v>

2426
01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:11.310
<v Speaker 3>the camera got better,</v>

2427
01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.240
<v Speaker 3>it got quicker,</v>

2428
01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:12.931
<v Speaker 3>it moves better,</v>

2429
01:15:12.931 --> 01:15:13.710
<v Speaker 3>has more,</v>

2430
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:14.543
<v Speaker 3>more features,</v>

2431
01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:19.080
<v Speaker 3>but the original android phones were dog shit.</v>

2432
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2433
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 3>they were so bad.</v>

2434
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.691
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember Brad?</v>

2435
01:15:21.691 --> 01:15:22.201
<v Speaker 3>Did you have one?</v>

2436
01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Brian at the front went the first droid.</v>

2437
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2438
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.660
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2439
01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.470
<v Speaker 3>I have one too.</v>

2440
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:26.340
<v Speaker 3>It was so bad.</v>

2441
01:15:26.341 --> 01:15:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I had it for one day and I brought it back in.</v>

2442
01:15:28.641 --> 01:15:31.050
<v Speaker 3>The Verizon guys were trying to talk me out of it and I go,</v>

2443
01:15:31.051 --> 01:15:31.710
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

2444
01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:32.310
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

2445
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.760
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

2446
01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.000
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

2447
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:33.390
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

2448
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to look.</v>

2449
01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Take it and they're like,</v>

2450
01:15:35.161 --> 01:15:36.180
<v Speaker 3>well you don't want to bring it back.</v>

2451
01:15:36.181 --> 01:15:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Like just get did get used to it.</v>

2452
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.761
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

2453
01:15:38.761 --> 01:15:39.391
<v Speaker 3>I really like it.</v>

2454
01:15:39.391 --> 01:15:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Get this piece of shit away from me.</v>

2455
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Cause I had an iPhone and I would try to switch to a droid to go on Verizon at</v>

2456
01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:46.020
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

2457
01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

2458
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you had Brian?</v>

2459
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.961
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2460
01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:50.720
<v Speaker 8>Here's me doing a review of the first one.</v>

2461
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:52.690
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2462
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:54.890
<v Speaker 8>the phone has a five megapixel camera.</v>

2463
01:15:54.891 --> 01:15:55.880
<v Speaker 8>It's got a flash.</v>

2464
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:58.040
<v Speaker 8>The camera is really good.</v>

2465
01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:00.890
<v Speaker 8>It has a watch guy looks though unfortunately.</v>

2466
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:02.930
<v Speaker 8>And you have to</v>

2467
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.690
<v Speaker 8>install,</v>

2468
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.400
<v Speaker 8>look at all this seems kind of,</v>

2469
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:08.720
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2470
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.340
<v Speaker 8>there's some things about it where you're just like,</v>

2471
01:16:10.341 --> 01:16:11.030
<v Speaker 8>why don't,</v>

2472
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.040
<v Speaker 8>why don't they just copy what works?</v>

2473
01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:14.660
<v Speaker 8>You know the iPhone works.</v>

2474
01:16:14.661 --> 01:16:16.640
<v Speaker 8>That's the best way to lead applications,</v>

2475
01:16:16.641 --> 01:16:17.474
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

2476
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:17.871
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2477
01:16:17.871 --> 01:16:19.470
<v Speaker 8>so there's a couple of things here and there that I know.</v>

2478
01:16:19.471 --> 01:16:20.271
<v Speaker 8>What's crazy is that,</v>

2479
01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:20.900
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2480
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.830
<v Speaker 8>down the line and more that droid started becoming more unpopular.</v>

2481
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:27.080
<v Speaker 8>They did start copying everything that iPhone used and that's why they're in</v>

2482
01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:27.651
<v Speaker 8>court right now.</v>

2483
01:16:27.651 --> 01:16:30.140
<v Speaker 8>Samsung versus apple in court.</v>

2484
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:30.360
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:30.700
<v Speaker 8>What are the,</v>

2486
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.360
<v Speaker 8>what is the lawsuit about,</v>

2487
01:16:32.361 --> 01:16:33.230
<v Speaker 8>do you know the specifics?</v>

2488
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:33.441
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2489
01:16:33.441 --> 01:16:34.610
<v Speaker 8>just a lot of different things.</v>

2490
01:16:34.611 --> 01:16:34.820
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

2491
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:35.540
<v Speaker 8>like uh,</v>

2492
01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.170
<v Speaker 8>like uh,</v>

2493
01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:36.441
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2494
01:16:36.441 --> 01:16:40.610
<v Speaker 8>the unlock screen I think like how you unlock the phone and just different like</v>

2495
01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:41.211
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2496
01:16:41.211 --> 01:16:42.920
<v Speaker 8>operating systems shit that,</v>

2497
01:16:42.921 --> 01:16:43.730
<v Speaker 8>that pretty much,</v>

2498
01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:45.350
<v Speaker 8>they just kind of just copied</v>

2499
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:46.770
<v Speaker 3>that apple figured out first.</v>

2500
01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.440
<v Speaker 3>And so the new iPhone is supposed to come out in June,</v>

2501
01:16:49.441 --> 01:16:49.970
<v Speaker 3>is that right?</v>

2502
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:53.600
<v Speaker 8>You is supposedly like the new iPhone six and then they're going to have the</v>

2503
01:16:53.601 --> 01:16:54.301
<v Speaker 8>giant one.</v>

2504
01:16:54.301 --> 01:16:57.200
<v Speaker 8>Supposedly this is just what they do every year where they announced it in June</v>

2505
01:16:57.201 --> 01:16:58.850
<v Speaker 8>and then it's like the next month they'll have,</v>

2506
01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.440
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2507
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.220
<v Speaker 8>one come out and then the bigger one,</v>

2508
01:17:01.221 --> 01:17:03.950
<v Speaker 8>like I guess in the other reason why they're waiting a little bit longer,</v>

2509
01:17:03.951 --> 01:17:04.520
<v Speaker 8>it's because the,</v>

2510
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.240
<v Speaker 8>the panels that are going to be using and the new phone or backwards so much</v>

2511
01:17:08.241 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 8>because when starts selling something new,</v>

2512
01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:10.611
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

2513
01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:11.340
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2514
01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:11.640
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

2515
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.180
<v Speaker 8>it pretty much just destroys anyone that does that.</v>

2516
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:14.541
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2517
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 8>like we make five inch screens.</v>

2518
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:16.251
<v Speaker 8>Well yeah,</v>

2519
01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:18.110
<v Speaker 8>apple is going to buy 5 million of these.</v>

2520
01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:19.200
<v Speaker 8>So it right.</v>

2521
01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Their screens are different too than like the,</v>

2522
01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:26.340
<v Speaker 3>that was the other thing that I was reading about the difference between the ht</v>

2523
01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.270
<v Speaker 3>one m eight,</v>

2524
01:17:27.271 --> 01:17:31.020
<v Speaker 3>which is like probably the highest rated android phone.</v>

2525
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2526
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2527
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:32.640
<v Speaker 3>have you seen that one?</v>

2528
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2529
01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fucking slick.</v>

2530
01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I even read an actual uh,</v>

2531
01:17:36.571 --> 01:17:38.640
<v Speaker 3>apple website was um,</v>

2532
01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:39.361
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2533
01:17:39.361 --> 01:17:44.361
<v Speaker 3>reviewing the HTC one m eight and they were saying that if apple built uh,</v>

2534
01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.630
<v Speaker 3>an android phone,</v>

2535
01:17:45.631 --> 01:17:46.980
<v Speaker 3>this would be the phone that they built.</v>

2536
01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:51.150
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty fucking slick and they actually have a different approach to</v>

2537
01:17:51.151 --> 01:17:52.260
<v Speaker 3>camera's entirely.</v>

2538
01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:54.270
<v Speaker 3>They have a small mega pixel phone.</v>

2539
01:17:54.271 --> 01:17:58.980
<v Speaker 3>That's how slick looking phone apparently the sound on these is incredible.</v>

2540
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.900
<v Speaker 3>The sound is supposed to be amazing.</v>

2541
01:18:00.901 --> 01:18:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Like literally it sounds like are a little radio like all like a little boombox.</v>

2542
01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:06.690
<v Speaker 8>I think that's one of the big deals to that.</v>

2543
01:18:06.691 --> 01:18:11.580
<v Speaker 8>Why I haven't been happy with as much as they android is I really think that</v>

2544
01:18:11.581 --> 01:18:14.970
<v Speaker 8>Samsung is not actually the best maker of the phones.</v>

2545
01:18:14.971 --> 01:18:17.880
<v Speaker 8>I think like even like these HTC seem a little bit</v>

2546
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.640
<v Speaker 8>better put together.</v>

2547
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:21.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:18:21.211 --> 01:18:21.391
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2549
01:18:21.391 --> 01:18:25.380
<v Speaker 3>this one is like particularly well designed but this one only has a four</v>

2550
01:18:25.381 --> 01:18:28.890
<v Speaker 3>megapixel or if they call ultra pixel phone.</v>

2551
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.440
<v Speaker 3>or ultra picture camera rather.</v>

2553
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:35.670
<v Speaker 3>And I don't understand that but it has to camera lenses.</v>

2554
01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:39.390
<v Speaker 3>You see what they're doing there while you're clicking back and forth with the</v>

2555
01:18:39.391 --> 01:18:44.391
<v Speaker 3>two lenses are there's two different cameras on the back and those two cameras</v>

2556
01:18:44.491 --> 01:18:49.491
<v Speaker 3>allow you to blur out the foreground or the background if you so choose to.</v>

2557
01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.210
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty slick for photos.</v>

2558
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.510
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the uh,</v>

2559
01:18:52.511 --> 01:18:56.010
<v Speaker 3>the pictures but four megapixels is just,</v>

2560
01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.960
<v Speaker 3>the images are just not going to be as large.</v>

2561
01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:59.310
<v Speaker 3>The real question becomes,</v>

2562
01:18:59.311 --> 01:19:00.960
<v Speaker 3>is four megapixels enough,</v>

2563
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.000
<v Speaker 8>four phones,</v>

2564
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:05.180
<v Speaker 8>phones are actually taking over cameras.</v>

2565
01:19:05.181 --> 01:19:05.421
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2566
01:19:05.421 --> 01:19:05.810
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

2567
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:09.470
<v Speaker 8>I haven't looked lately but I'm pretty sure that that the camera sales,</v>

2568
01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:14.471
<v Speaker 8>especially pointed shooters are completely other than it should or I used to buy</v>

2569
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 8>them all the time because you know,</v>

2570
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.680
<v Speaker 8>those were great to put in your pocket but now it is,</v>

2571
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 8>you don't need it.</v>

2572
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:19:19.461 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I have one that I use just for after shows.</v>

2574
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Like why I have people like line up and take pictures with them and then I put</v>

2575
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:30.290
<v Speaker 3>it up on my website cause it cause it saves time.</v>

2576
01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:31.483
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2577
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:32.773
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

2578
01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.880
<v Speaker 3>the actual need for them,</v>

2579
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 3>for the average person it's almost nonexistent unless you're like one of those</v>

2580
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 3>SLR type people that has a big crazy lens and all that jazz.</v>

2581
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.540
<v Speaker 8>I guess that that technology you were talking about like blurring the</v>

2582
01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:50.490
<v Speaker 8>foregrounds actually built into the new android operating system that,</v>

2583
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:50.930
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

2584
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:51.900
<v Speaker 8>that whole thing.</v>

2585
01:19:51.901 --> 01:19:52.050
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2586
01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:52.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2587
01:19:52.531 --> 01:19:54.060
<v Speaker 3>You can do it with software.</v>

2588
01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:58.530
<v Speaker 3>The difference with the HTC one is it actually does it with hardware as well and</v>

2589
01:19:58.531 --> 01:19:59.820
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to look slicker.</v>

2590
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.620
<v Speaker 3>They have that avail of that ability to do it on the HTC or not the HDC,</v>

2591
01:20:04.621 --> 01:20:06.900
<v Speaker 3>the Samsung galaxy s five as well.</v>

2592
01:20:06.901 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>You do that in</v>

2593
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.933
<v Speaker 9>the background.</v>

2594
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.890
<v Speaker 9>I just think that what HTC has decided to do is try to do it with two different</v>

2595
01:20:13.891 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 9>cameras at the same time.</v>

2596
01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:16.690
<v Speaker 8>So is this the,</v>

2597
01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:17.960
<v Speaker 8>what would you say this is the,</v>

2598
01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:18.590
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2599
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:20.330
<v Speaker 8>the one to do the buy now.</v>

2600
01:20:20.331 --> 01:20:21.470
<v Speaker 8>If you were going to get a new android or,</v>

2601
01:20:21.471 --> 01:20:21.680
<v Speaker 8>Gee,</v>

2602
01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.820
<v Speaker 8>you think the nexus right?</v>

2603
01:20:22.821 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 8>The next,</v>

2604
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:24.540
<v Speaker 8>I love the nexus eyeful.</v>

2605
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.680
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2606
01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.670
<v Speaker 8>I like the HTC one two I have to say I think both of them are great,</v>

2607
01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.140
<v Speaker 8>great hardware solutions.</v>

2608
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:34.880
<v Speaker 8>Then you have to really be careful about what software is loaded on them because</v>

2609
01:20:34.881 --> 01:20:36.380
<v Speaker 8>depending on which car you get it from,</v>

2610
01:20:36.381 --> 01:20:37.970
<v Speaker 8>they're going to have different quality of software.</v>

2611
01:20:37.971 --> 01:20:41.720
<v Speaker 8>Where this is the latest kit Kat or an earlier version I get,</v>

2612
01:20:41.721 --> 01:20:42.650
<v Speaker 8>my phone's on locked,</v>

2613
01:20:42.651 --> 01:20:45.970
<v Speaker 8>I wiped them and I replaced the software with my own choices immediately.</v>

2614
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:46.883
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2615
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.410
<v Speaker 9>It does.</v>

2616
01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:48.071
<v Speaker 9>How hard is that?</v>

2617
01:20:48.071 --> 01:20:49.240
<v Speaker 9>How much time does that take?</v>

2618
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.863
<v Speaker 9>It's not a matter of,</v>

2619
01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:53.890
<v Speaker 9>I mean it takes me two or three days to get everything done,</v>

2620
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:55.420
<v Speaker 9>but I mean,</v>

2621
01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:56.050
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2622
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:56.281
<v Speaker 9>not,</v>

2623
01:20:56.281 --> 01:20:57.640
<v Speaker 9>not full time time.</v>

2624
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.990
<v Speaker 9>That's a lot of time.</v>

2625
01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.480
<v Speaker 9>Nobody does this stuff.</v>

2626
01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:00.791
<v Speaker 9>Listen,</v>

2627
01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:01.071
<v Speaker 9>I'm a,</v>

2628
01:21:01.071 --> 01:21:02.710
<v Speaker 9>I'm a technology contrary and I,</v>

2629
01:21:02.711 --> 01:21:04.330
<v Speaker 9>android versus iPhone.</v>

2630
01:21:04.331 --> 01:21:06.700
<v Speaker 9>I do android windows versus Linux.</v>

2631
01:21:06.701 --> 01:21:09.460
<v Speaker 9>I do Linux even when it's at first dog shits,</v>

2632
01:21:09.461 --> 01:21:10.510
<v Speaker 9>user experience.</v>

2633
01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.680
<v Speaker 9>I do it anyway for the freedom and the versatility.</v>

2634
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 9>Mac Laptop and I'm an early adopter on a bitcoin and so yeah,</v>

2635
01:21:19.481 --> 01:21:23.440
<v Speaker 9>I have a Mac laptop and I run the run apple on or I read something crazy.</v>

2636
01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 9>I run apple on it tonight.</v>

2637
01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:27.310
<v Speaker 9>Also run Linux machines on it too as virtual machines.</v>

2638
01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:28.270
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2639
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:30.250
<v Speaker 9>so I have a combination of operating systems here.</v>

2640
01:21:30.251 --> 01:21:32.020
<v Speaker 9>But you run Linux on an apple laptop,</v>

2641
01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:32.854
<v Speaker 9>you could do that.</v>

2642
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:33.250
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2643
01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:33.930
<v Speaker 9>it was not official.</v>

2644
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:34.840
<v Speaker 9>I know that you could do that.</v>

2645
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:37.680
<v Speaker 9>They still have that option to run windows on Mac laptops.</v>

2646
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:38.740
<v Speaker 9>We've got windows seven here,</v>

2647
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.360
<v Speaker 9>two windows</v>

2648
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:40.911
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

2649
01:21:40.911 --> 01:21:42.470
<v Speaker 8>Have you used lately?</v>

2650
01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.940
<v Speaker 8>It's so do they,</v>

2651
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.600
<v Speaker 8>when are they just going to give up and start over?</v>

2652
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:47.483
<v Speaker 8>Not going to they uh,</v>

2653
01:21:47.530 --> 01:21:49.370
<v Speaker 8>they still have a giant chunk of the market.</v>

2654
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.670
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2655
01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:53.570
<v Speaker 8>I love what they're doing now is that they're actually making money off a still</v>

2656
01:21:53.571 --> 01:21:56.120
<v Speaker 8>supporting windows 98 to banks.</v>

2657
01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:56.961
<v Speaker 8>Like they were like,</v>

2658
01:21:56.961 --> 01:21:57.141
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2659
01:21:57.141 --> 01:22:01.220
<v Speaker 8>we give up on windows 98 or XP and we give up on windows XP,</v>

2660
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.320
<v Speaker 8>but will you know if you want to pay us.</v>

2661
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:07.800
<v Speaker 9>Did you remember when they had windows stores at the mall that didn't sell</v>

2662
01:22:07.801 --> 01:22:08.580
<v Speaker 9>anything?</v>

2663
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:09.413
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2664
01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:11.090
<v Speaker 9>they had a windows store and I went in.</v>

2665
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:11.401
<v Speaker 9>I'm like,</v>

2666

2672
01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:19.220
<v Speaker 9>While we're windows were not computer sellers.</v>

<v Speaker 9>We're,</v>

2674
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:20.340
<v Speaker 9>we're an operating system.</v>

2675
01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:21.330
<v Speaker 9>They sold windows.</v>

2676
01:22:21.331 --> 01:22:22.260
<v Speaker 9>You could buy windows there.</v>

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:28.251
<v Speaker 9>He,</v>

2686
01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:36.414
<v Speaker 9>computers.</v>

2687
01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.273
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.430
<v Speaker 9>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>

2689
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 8>They haven't been out of the windows store is now sell everything.</v>

2690
01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:42.571
<v Speaker 8>Laptops.</v>

2691
01:22:42.571 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 8>They have all that stuff.</v>

2692
01:22:43.651 --> 01:22:46.670
<v Speaker 8>The surface and it's still not of itself.</v>

2693
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.191
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2694
01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:47.461
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2695
01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:48.630
<v Speaker 8>I'm more interested in these,</v>

2696
01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:50.130
<v Speaker 8>these into android notebooks.</v>

2697
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 8>I saw one the other day.</v>

2698
01:22:51.061 --> 01:22:52.230
<v Speaker 8>I think that's the way to go.</v>

2699
01:22:52.231 --> 01:22:54.480
<v Speaker 8>If you just want it a little teeny notebook to put in your,</v>

2700
01:22:54.481 --> 01:22:54.811

<v Speaker 8>the check email and stuff like that.</v>

2702
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:59.170
<v Speaker 9>Maybe they did sell computers and I'm wrong.</v>

2703
01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:00.280
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2704
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.130
<v Speaker 8>I think there were some early windows stores that didn't and it was just more</v>

2705
01:23:03.131 --> 01:23:04.400
<v Speaker 8>like kiosks or no,</v>

2706
01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

2707
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2708
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.330
<v Speaker 3>when I went to one of them that's what are,</v>

2709
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:08.613
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm wrong,</v>

2710
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember cause it was quite a while ago,</v>

2711
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:13.540
<v Speaker 3>but I remember going in and my kids were playing with like one of the things</v>

2712
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:14.280
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

2713
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:19.140
<v Speaker 8>like I said says this article on cio.com for things you'll love about HTCs once</v>

2714
01:23:19.141 --> 01:23:20.070
<v Speaker 8>and for you won't.</v>

2715
01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:25.460
<v Speaker 8>What you won't love about the HTC one inmate duo camera is disappointing single</v>

2716
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:27.181
<v Speaker 8>most unfortunately.</v>

2717
01:23:27.181 --> 01:23:28.830
<v Speaker 8>Thing about HD one is to camera.</v>

2718
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:29.580
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2719
01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:34.440
<v Speaker 3>The device rear facing four megapixel duo camera with ultra pixel technology</v>

2720
01:23:34.441 --> 01:23:39.441
<v Speaker 3>stop moving two different lenses allows user to d checked and calculate the</v>

2721
01:23:40.231 --> 01:23:42.000
<v Speaker 3>relative distance of subjects in the image.</v>

2722
01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:42.571
<v Speaker 3>Sounds cool.</v>

2723
01:23:42.571 --> 01:23:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2724
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Well except for the measly four megapixels,</v>

2725
01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:52.010
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't take long to at all to realize that while the camera works fairly</v>

2726
01:23:52.351 --> 01:23:53.930
<v Speaker 3>well in dimly lit environments.</v>

2727
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:54.031
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2728
01:23:54.031 --> 01:23:54.930
<v Speaker 3>So that was the idea.</v>

2729
01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
<v Speaker 3>They kept with the low mega pixel to or another function better in low</v>

2730
01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:01.890
<v Speaker 3>environments,</v>

2731
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:06.640
<v Speaker 8>but then that that quality turned the Tay is to be left to be desired.</v>

2732
01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:07.000
<v Speaker 8>So the,</v>

2733
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:07.171
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2734
01:24:07.171 --> 01:24:08.680
<v Speaker 8>the what you're going to use it most of the time,</v>

2735
01:24:08.681 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 8>probably during the day.</v>

2736
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:10.833
<v Speaker 8>It sucks.</v>

2737
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:11.351
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2738
01:24:11.351 --> 01:24:15.640
<v Speaker 3>So there's only two options that are really good if you want to go with,</v>

2739
01:24:15.641 --> 01:24:16.474
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2740
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.080
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2741
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.040
<v Speaker 3>with phones,</v>

2742
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.581
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2743
01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 3>that Lumina and the,</v>

2744
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:21.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2745
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.053
<v Speaker 3>the apple,</v>

2746
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 3>those are the two big ones.</v>

2747
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.771
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2748
01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:26.920
<v Speaker 3>And then apparently there's Sony Xperia too for cameras.</v>

2749
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2750
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 3>The Sony Xperia apparently has a pretty dope camera too.</v>

2751
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:33.460
<v Speaker 3>So I think the reason they're putting two cameras on the back of the phone,</v>

2752
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 3>which would be interesting is where you get to the ability to shoot 3-d</v>

2753
01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:38.463
<v Speaker 3>directly.</v>

2754
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think about it,</v>

2755
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:44.350
<v Speaker 3>this phone is now wide enough that you can separate the cameras if five about as</v>

2756
01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 3>much as your eyes are separated at the focal distance and then you can shoot,</v>

2757
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:49.720
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2758
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.830
<v Speaker 3>direct three d off two cameras.</v>

2759
01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:51.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2760
01:24:51.971 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when they had that?</v>

2761
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 3>For awhile they had three d photography on some of those crazy phones.</v>

2762
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.713
<v Speaker 3>You remember?</v>

2763
01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.720
<v Speaker 3>Was it good enough?</v>

2764
01:24:58.721 --> 01:25:01.840
<v Speaker 3>There were really weird and it only worked on your phone.</v>

2765
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't work on the computer.</v>

2766
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.833
<v Speaker 3>Look at there</v>

2767
01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:05.751
<v Speaker 6>the first,</v>

2768
01:25:05.751 --> 01:25:09.410
<v Speaker 6>the first iteration is always clooci and heal,</v>

2769
01:25:09.411 --> 01:25:11.140
<v Speaker 6>but I like to have the choice.</v>

2770
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2771
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.650
<v Speaker 6>Cloogy let's close.</v>

2772
01:25:12.651 --> 01:25:13.690
<v Speaker 6>You mean it's,</v>

2773
01:25:13.730 --> 01:25:14.630
<v Speaker 6>it's rough.</v>

2774
01:25:14.631 --> 01:25:16.100
<v Speaker 6>It's rough around the edges.</v>

2775
01:25:16.101 --> 01:25:21.030
<v Speaker 6>Would have ever used an English word to start using g chord.</v>

2776
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:21.873
<v Speaker 6>He'd be herbal.</v>

2777
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:24.560
<v Speaker 6>How dare you double it?</v>

2778
01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.880
<v Speaker 6>Urban Dictionary.</v>

2779
01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:26.420
<v Speaker 6>Is it?</v>

2780
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:26.661
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2781
01:25:26.661 --> 01:25:27.410
<v Speaker 6>it's an urban one.</v>

2782
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.770
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2783
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:28.130
<v Speaker 6>I dunno.</v>

2784
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.641
<v Speaker 6>It's a geek.</v>

2785
01:25:28.641 --> 01:25:29.330
<v Speaker 6>It's a geek term,</v>

2786
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:32.870
<v Speaker 6>but I mean it's the first iteration of the technology has always flaky,</v>

2787
01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:37.670
<v Speaker 6>but if it's a powerful and disruptive enough,</v>

2788
01:25:37.671 --> 01:25:40.880
<v Speaker 6>then there'll be an incentive to make it better.</v>

2789
01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:44.780
<v Speaker 6>When when I use the first iterations of web browsers,</v>

2790
01:25:44.781 --> 01:25:45.680
<v Speaker 6>there were terrible.</v>

2791
01:25:45.681 --> 01:25:47.690
<v Speaker 6>The first versions of android there were terrible,</v>

2792
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.553
<v Speaker 6>and guess what?</v>

2793
01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.560
<v Speaker 6>The first versions of bitcoin wallets are terrible,</v>

2794
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:54.740
<v Speaker 6>but I have choice and I love that.</v>

2795
01:25:54.741 --> 01:25:55.130
<v Speaker 6>I'd love,</v>

2796
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:58.520
<v Speaker 6>I'd rather be on the cutting edge and be dealing with something that's rough</v>

2797
01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:02.180
<v Speaker 6>around the edges and get to experience the technology as it matures.</v>

2798
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 6>Eventually it will get to the point where it's as easy to use as an IPAD,</v>

2799
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:09.550
<v Speaker 6>which is how my mom got on the Internet and Bitcoin,</v>

2800
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:10.860
<v Speaker 6>we'll get to that point to,</v>

2801
01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:12.173
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2802
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 6>to me choices,</v>

2803
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 6>more importance than,</v>

2804
01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.380
<v Speaker 6>than Polish.</v>

2805
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:18.770
<v Speaker 6>But for other people they go with the opposite choice and that's perfectly</v>

2806
01:26:18.771 --> 01:26:19.604
<v Speaker 6>understandable.</v>

2807
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.520
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting man.</v>

2808
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2809
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:24.310
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you in a lot of ways,</v>

2810
01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:29.610
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's a similarity to a windows and apple,</v>

2811
01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:31.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2812
01:26:31.631 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2813
01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.780
<v Speaker 3>as far as like apple phones and you know,</v>

2814
01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2815
01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:39.700
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea of the way apple lock things down and controls it and windows</v>

2816
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.850
<v Speaker 3>where they don't and they allow you to get into the registry,</v>

2817
01:26:42.851 --> 01:26:45.850
<v Speaker 3>the allow you to do a lot of things with the computers and a lot of power users</v>

2818
01:26:45.851 --> 01:26:47.220
<v Speaker 3>like break it.</v>

2819
01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:47.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2820
01:26:47.741 --> 01:26:48.820
<v Speaker 3>The average person might,</v>

2821
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.160
<v Speaker 3>it might fuck it up and up.</v>

2822
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:55.830
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that that could possibly have like a rational,</v>

2823
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:57.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2824
01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:01.630
<v Speaker 3>effect on Apple's decision to not have bitcoin wallets outside of the commerce?</v>

2825
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:01.891
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2826
01:27:01.891 --> 01:27:02.431
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

2827
01:27:02.431 --> 01:27:02.641
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2828
01:27:02.641 --> 01:27:03.510
<v Speaker 6>So as I said,</v>

2829
01:27:03.511 --> 01:27:03.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2830
01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:04.140
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2831
01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.340
<v Speaker 6>the straightforward one is that it introduces risk and an environment that is</v>

2832
01:27:08.341 --> 01:27:11.040
<v Speaker 6>deliberately conservative about quality,</v>

2833
01:27:11.041 --> 01:27:13.080
<v Speaker 6>security and control over the environment.</v>

2834
01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.620
<v Speaker 6>So they're going to be slow to adopt things that are disruptive</v>

2835
01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.560
<v Speaker 6>and it's also self serving because it threatens their payment network and it</v>

2836
01:27:22.561 --> 01:27:26.550
<v Speaker 6>might be self serving because it also threatens their ability to introduce their</v>

2837
01:27:26.551 --> 01:27:29.460
<v Speaker 6>own form of digital currency with digital wallets,</v>

2838
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:32.070
<v Speaker 6>which there are a lot of rumors that they're in,</v>

2839
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.110
<v Speaker 6>in working on that.</v>

2840
01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2841
01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:35.480
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2842
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.260
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2843
01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:36.420
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2844
01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean you can take all of those together and it makes sense,</v>

2845
01:27:39.511 --> 01:27:43.410
<v Speaker 6>but it's not a longterm decision because if there's enough momentum behind</v>

2846
01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.370
<v Speaker 6>digital currencies,</v>

2847
01:27:44.371 --> 01:27:47.400
<v Speaker 6>eventually they're going to add them slower than everybody else,</v>

2848
01:27:47.401 --> 01:27:48.234
<v Speaker 6>but they will get it.</v>

2849
01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought about the future and looked at like the trends,</v>

2850
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.220
<v Speaker 3>the technological trends,</v>

2851
01:27:54.221 --> 01:27:55.360
<v Speaker 3>and tried to extrapolate,</v>

2852
01:27:55.361 --> 01:28:00.361
<v Speaker 3>like what would be the method for exchanging controlling bitcoin in the very</v>

2853
01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:01.601
<v Speaker 3>near future?</v>

2854
01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:06.601
<v Speaker 3>Is there like a better version of what these apps can provide on phones that you</v>

2855
01:28:07.421 --> 01:28:09.880
<v Speaker 3>believe could be implemented sometime in the near future?</v>

2856
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.251
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2857
01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.084
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

2858
01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:11.660
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2859
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.530
<v Speaker 6>at the moment,</v>

2860
01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:13.933
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2861
01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:14.890
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2862
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:19.890
<v Speaker 6>you don't want to have a lot of the raw elements of the system expose to users</v>

2863
01:28:21.021 --> 01:28:22.990
<v Speaker 6>who don't want to learn anything about these.</v>

2864
01:28:22.991 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 6>So right now there's a pretty steep learning curve if you want to understand</v>

2865
01:28:26.211 --> 01:28:27.490
<v Speaker 6>digital crypto currencies,</v>

2866
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2867
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 6>just the name alone,</v>

2868
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 6>like crypto currencies sounds so awfully geeky and weird,</v>

2869
01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:35.090
<v Speaker 6>but if you want to understand digital money,</v>

2870
01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:36.290
<v Speaker 6>let's start by renaming that,</v>

2871
01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:36.530
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2872
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:37.670
<v Speaker 6>So it's a digital money.</v>

2873
01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 6>If you want to understand digital money,</v>

2874
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.903
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2875
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:42.710
<v Speaker 6>you get introduced these terms,</v>

2876
01:28:42.711 --> 01:28:43.311
<v Speaker 6>public key,</v>

2877
01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:45.500
<v Speaker 6>private key encryption,</v>

2878
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:47.720
<v Speaker 6>address wallet,</v>

2879
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 6>a Bitcoin address,</v>

2880
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2881
01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 6>transaction.</v>

2882
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:54.980
<v Speaker 6>All of these are confusing terms because they don't actually mean what they,</v>

2883
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:55.730
<v Speaker 6>what they,</v>

2884
01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:56.570
<v Speaker 6>what you think they mean.</v>

2885
01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.840
<v Speaker 6>So a bitcoin wallet is not actually a wallet because it doesn't contain coins.</v>

2886
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.920
<v Speaker 6>It only contains the keys that allow you to unlock the coins.</v>

2887
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.430
<v Speaker 6>The coins are actually on the network and you get into all of these things where</v>

2888
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:12.600
<v Speaker 6>you've picked a name that name evokes a thought,</v>

2889
01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:16.200
<v Speaker 6>but that thought doesn't quite match what's really happening.</v>

2890
01:29:16.201 --> 01:29:19.290
<v Speaker 6>So it ends up confusing rather than enlightened.</v>

2891
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.591
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2892
01:29:19.591 --> 01:29:24.591
<v Speaker 6>So a good name is one that tells you how this is going to work because it evokes</v>

2893
01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 6>the correct paradigm,</v>

2894
01:29:26.881 --> 01:29:28.230
<v Speaker 6>the correct user interface</v>

2895
01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:30.930
<v Speaker 6>design.</v>

2896
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.930
<v Speaker 6>And so we don't have that in bit coin yet.</v>

2897
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 6>The words are wrong,</v>

2898
01:29:35.701 --> 01:29:37.020
<v Speaker 6>the terminology is wrong.</v>

2899
01:29:37.021 --> 01:29:39.630
<v Speaker 6>The user interface and user experience is still very,</v>

2900
01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:40.464
<v Speaker 6>very geeky.</v>

2901
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.390
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2902
01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:43.620
<v Speaker 6>that happened on the Internet.</v>

2903
01:29:43.621 --> 01:29:48.621
<v Speaker 6>I remember watching in 1994 there's this classic segment on Good Morning America</v>

2904
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:51.300
<v Speaker 6>when the like,</v>

2905
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:51.870
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

2906
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:54.150
<v Speaker 6>so the thing with the at sign is that the Internet,</v>

2907
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:54.841
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2908
01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:55.021
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2909
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:55.351
<v Speaker 6>Kelly.</v>

2910
01:29:55.351 --> 01:29:55.741
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

2911
01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 6>that's email and um,</v>

2912
01:29:58.170 --> 01:29:59.040
<v Speaker 6>and the dots,</v>

2913
01:29:59.041 --> 01:29:59.341
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2914
01:29:59.341 --> 01:30:00.390
<v Speaker 6>that's the internet.</v>

2915
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:04.260
<v Speaker 6>And so why are there all the slashes and what does an IP address?</v>

2916
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:05.640
<v Speaker 6>And I don't really understand any of this.</v>

2917
01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:06.140
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2918
01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

2919
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.400
<v Speaker 6>and you get to two things.</v>

2920
01:30:08.401 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>

2921
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:11.340
<v Speaker 6>the technology gets smoother and more polished,</v>

2922
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:14.490
<v Speaker 6>and the words get at the same time,</v>

2923
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:19.520
<v Speaker 6>the culture changes and the culture gradually adopts the terminology so that now</v>

2924
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:25.740
<v Speaker 6>people are more comfortable with a weird words and the words have gotten less</v>

2925
01:30:25.741 --> 01:30:29.070
<v Speaker 6>weird and somewhere in the middle of the meat and you get mainstream adoption.</v>

2926
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.651
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2927
01:30:29.651 --> 01:30:34.651
<v Speaker 5>are people working on trying to get any sort of a bit coin wallet reintroduced</v>

2928
01:30:34.981 --> 01:30:35.880
<v Speaker 5>into the Apple,</v>

2929
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:38.730
<v Speaker 5>the APP store because there was one for a while,</v>

2930
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:38.911
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2931
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:40.170
<v Speaker 5>Was there more than one or was one,</v>

2932
01:30:40.171 --> 01:30:41.190
<v Speaker 5>it was more than one.</v>

2933
01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:42.390
<v Speaker 5>And now there's more to,</v>

2934
01:30:42.391 --> 01:30:46.050
<v Speaker 5>there's new ones have been reintroduced already to the apple store.</v>

2935
01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:46.321
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2936
01:30:46.321 --> 01:30:46.891
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

2937
01:30:46.891 --> 01:30:48.150
<v Speaker 5>They use a few little,</v>

2938
01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:48.840
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2939
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.700
<v Speaker 5>how do I call this loopholes?</v>

2940
01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.151
<v Speaker 5>Are you,</v>

2941
01:30:51.151 --> 01:30:53.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm outing them or should we not say their name?</v>

2942
01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:55.110
<v Speaker 5>I won't say their names at the moment,</v>

2943
01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:57.240
<v Speaker 5>but there are ways to do this.</v>

2944
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:58.440
<v Speaker 5>Then what's the point?</v>

2945
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 5>You're the fucking bitcoin.</v>

2946
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:00.181
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

2947
01:31:00.181 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 5>If you don't say their names,</v>

2948
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:03.510
<v Speaker 5>they don't get promoted and they fucking die on the vine.</v>

2949
01:31:03.511 --> 01:31:04.470
<v Speaker 5>You'll get pulled immediately.</v>

2950
01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Well they get pulled immediately.</v>

2951
01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:09.630
<v Speaker 5>If you say their name Amy later for Nintendo's like a pop up almost every day on</v>

2952
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:10.110
<v Speaker 5>the story.</v>

2953
01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:13.000
<v Speaker 5>It's like some backdoor into something like food cooking programs.</v>

2954
01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:13.834
<v Speaker 5>People want,</v>

2955
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:18.000
<v Speaker 5>if people want to find bitcoin wallets for I os they can search for those terms</v>

2956
01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:18.834
<v Speaker 5>and find them.</v>

2957
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.800
<v Speaker 5>And essentially the other way to do it is by building a pure html five wallet,</v>

2958
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:26.760
<v Speaker 5>the runs entirely in the browser.</v>

2959
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.710
<v Speaker 5>And then it's not an app you install,</v>

2960
01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:29.850
<v Speaker 5>it's a page you visit,</v>

2961
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:31.020
<v Speaker 5>but it's fully functional.</v>

2962
01:31:31.021 --> 01:31:34.080
<v Speaker 5>It looks like an application that they have those we're building those.</v>

2963
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.500
<v Speaker 5>Every company in the space is building one of those right now to avoid the whole</v>

2964
01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:38.334
<v Speaker 5>APP system,</v>

2965
01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:39.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2966
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:42.480
<v Speaker 5>to get around the APP system and to enable users to use it through the browser.</v>

2967
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.150
<v Speaker 5>And you still have to use Apple's browser though.</v>

2968
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:45.541
<v Speaker 5>Correct?</v>

2969
01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 5>You can't use chrome yet.</v>

2970
01:31:46.681 --> 01:31:48.330
<v Speaker 5>Can you can use chrome for apple?</v>

2971
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:50.783
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2972
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 5>I have a chrome application.</v>

2973
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:54.810
<v Speaker 5>They have Microsoft word now on Ios.</v>

2974
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.720
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2975
01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.270
<v Speaker 5>So any html five browser.</v>

2976
01:31:57.271 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 5>And that's the nice thing about html five.</v>

2977
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 5>It's the new version of the web</v>

2978
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 6>protocol and it will run on any browser on any device and it will give you a</v>

2979
01:32:04.031 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 6>full app like experience.</v>

2980
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:07.630
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't feel like a webpage.</v>

2981
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.430
<v Speaker 6>It feels like an application.</v>

2982
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:10.450
<v Speaker 6>So That's interesting.</v>

2983
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:11.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2984
01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:12.250
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>

2985
01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 2>So that we'll cut it all out.</v>

2986
01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 2>If you can get online then you can get to this web page,</v>

2987
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 2>then you can trade bitcoin period.</v>

2988
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 6>So exactly.</v>

2989
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 6>And this is what's exciting about the bitcoin space for me,</v>

2990
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:23.690
<v Speaker 6>which is that uh,</v>

2991
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 6>we talk about this idea that we're going to convert dollars to bitcoin.</v>

2992
01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:31.720
<v Speaker 6>Like if only say Amazon adopts Bitcoin,</v>

2993
01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:36.690
<v Speaker 6>then all of the stuff they're selling through bitcoin will now be sold through a</v>

2994
01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:39.340
<v Speaker 6>will that be solved through bitcoin instead of dollars.</v>

2995
01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:42.400
<v Speaker 6>And it's like chewing out little parts of the,</v>

2996
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 6>of the traditional economy and just converting it into a different currency.</v>

2997
01:32:45.701 --> 01:32:47.050
<v Speaker 6>And that is boring.</v>

2998
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.891
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

2999
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:49.000
<v Speaker 6>So not the point.</v>

3000
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 6>That's a bit like thinking that,</v>

3001
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:51.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3002
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.810
<v Speaker 6>the Internet succeeds when all phone calls happen on the Internet and we've</v>

3003
01:32:55.811 --> 01:33:00.811
<v Speaker 6>taken over the entire facts market and now facts is dominated by Internet,</v>

3004
01:33:02.441 --> 01:33:03.010
<v Speaker 6>fax.</v>

3005
01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.740
<v Speaker 6>And the whole point is that it made facts irrelevant.</v>

3006
01:33:05.741 --> 01:33:07.120
<v Speaker 6>It didn't replace it,</v>

3007
01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:10.270
<v Speaker 6>it made it irrelevant and it didn't replace phone calls.</v>

3008
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:14.350
<v Speaker 6>It gave people better communication tools and different communication tools.</v>

3009
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm more interested in what we can do with bitcoin that can be done today rather</v>

3010
01:33:18.311 --> 01:33:22.710
<v Speaker 6>than replacing the things we already do with dollars or visa and making a bet of</v>

3011
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.160
<v Speaker 6>visa,</v>

3012
01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.000
<v Speaker 6>better pay pal,</v>

3013
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:26.080
<v Speaker 6>a better online shopping experience.</v>

3014
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.280
<v Speaker 6>That stuff is board.</v>

3015
01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 6>So here's what's happening within the bitcoin economy,</v>

3016
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:34.150
<v Speaker 6>there's now hundreds of startups and they're hiring people.</v>

3017
01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:34.531
<v Speaker 6>We're,</v>

3018
01:33:34.531 --> 01:33:37.900
<v Speaker 6>we have a jobs fair in Sunnyvale on May 3rd,</v>

3019
01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:38.441
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3020
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:41.680
<v Speaker 6>where we're going to have hundreds of people and dozens of companies with job</v>

3021
01:33:41.681 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 6>open openings,</v>

3022
01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 6>hiring developers and designers and marketing professionals and all kinds of</v>

3023
01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:46.834
<v Speaker 6>things like that.</v>

3024
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:47.290
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

3025
01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:47.620
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3026
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:49.810
<v Speaker 6>for those who are probably new to this market,</v>

3027
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.960
<v Speaker 6>a jobs fair is this thing that happened before 2008 where companies actually had</v>

3028
01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 6>jobs and would come to you in order to find you.</v>

3029
01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:00.163
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3030
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:05.490
<v Speaker 6>And we're doing this in bitcoin because of this incredible spirit of innovation</v>

3031
01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:06.490
<v Speaker 6>that's been unleashed.</v>

3032
01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:11.580
<v Speaker 6>So if you're an entrepreneur and you look at these rough edges and you look at</v>

3033
01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:13.540
<v Speaker 6>these difficulties in the system,</v>

3034
01:34:13.541 --> 01:34:16.330
<v Speaker 6>and you'd look at the fact that it's not ready for mainstream adoption,</v>

3035
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:18.940
<v Speaker 6>what you see as opportunity,</v>

3036
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.100
<v Speaker 6>massive opportunity.</v>

3037
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 6>Because remember at first on the Internet,</v>

3038
01:34:24.251 --> 01:34:25.360
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't find anything.</v>

3039
01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:26.740
<v Speaker 6>So someone said,</v>

3040
01:34:26.741 --> 01:34:27.370
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3041
01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.870
<v Speaker 6>how about we build a search engine?</v>

3042
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.680
<v Speaker 6>And now that's a multi hundred billion dollar company,</v>

3043
01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:33.670
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3044
01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 6>And search became,</v>

3045
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:35.411
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3046
01:34:35.411 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 6>an entire industry out of a single problem.</v>

3047
01:34:39.670 --> 01:34:41.650
<v Speaker 6>And the problem was you couldn't find anything.</v>

3048
01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.060
<v Speaker 6>Now you can find everything.</v>

3049
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:44.830
<v Speaker 6>And so at first people said,</v>

3050
01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:45.011
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3051
01:34:45.011 --> 01:34:48.040
<v Speaker 6>the Internet is never going to succeed because you can't find anything on the</v>

3052
01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:48.640
<v Speaker 6>Internet.</v>

3053
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.950
<v Speaker 6>And smart entrepreneurs took that problem and said,</v>

3054
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.520
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3055
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.840
<v Speaker 6>if I solve this problem,</v>

3056
01:34:52.841 --> 01:34:54.400
<v Speaker 6>not only do I make the internet work,</v>

3057
01:34:54.401 --> 01:34:56.410
<v Speaker 6>but I also creates an entirely new industry.</v>

3058
01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 6>So right now,</v>

3059
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:59.120
<v Speaker 6>bitcoin is difficult to use.</v>

3060
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.980
<v Speaker 6>But if you solve that problem,</v>

3061
01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.590
<v Speaker 6>if you take for example the fact that a bitcoin addresses like a 37 character</v>

3062
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 6>thing and it's unreadable and you hide that,</v>

3063
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.800
<v Speaker 6>just like we no longer use IP addresses on the Internet,</v>

3064
01:35:12.801 --> 01:35:14.660
<v Speaker 6>we use nice and easy to use names.</v>

3065
01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.160
<v Speaker 6>We used to use,</v>

3066
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.001
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3067
01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:20.360
<v Speaker 6>one nine two.one six eight.zero.one and you had to,</v>

3068
01:35:20.361 --> 01:35:22.760
<v Speaker 6>I had the list in my wallet of Ip addresses.</v>

3069
01:35:22.761 --> 01:35:24.440
<v Speaker 6>If I want it to go to the Stanford website,</v>

3070
01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 6>I had to pull out my wallet and look up their Ip address.</v>

3071
01:35:27.831 --> 01:35:31.310
<v Speaker 6>That's how I used to work and there was no way that was going to go mainstream.</v>

3072
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:34.790
<v Speaker 6>So each one of these problems,</v>

3073
01:35:34.791 --> 01:35:39.791
<v Speaker 6>he's one of these rough edges is an opportunity to create a whole new industry</v>

3074
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:45.590
<v Speaker 6>that does things in a different way that reinvents financial services in the</v>

3075
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:50.591
<v Speaker 6>makes them new and innovative and decentralized and enables things that have</v>

3076
01:35:51.351 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 6>never been done before.</v>

3077
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 6>This is not about making a better shopping experience.</v>

3078
01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 6>It's about doing things we couldn't do before.</v>

3079
01:35:58.130 --> 01:36:03.130
<v Speaker 6>And eventually people are going to build wallets that are very easy to use and</v>

3080
01:36:03.381 --> 01:36:05.930
<v Speaker 6>wallets that are going to be very beautifully designed.</v>

3081
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:10.990
<v Speaker 6>And we're beginning to see that now as all of these startups are rushing in to</v>

3082
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 6>fill in the gaps,</v>

3083
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:17.180
<v Speaker 6>to polish all the rough edges and to deliver real quality consumer products that</v>

3084
01:36:17.181 --> 01:36:22.181
<v Speaker 6>people can take this incredible underlying power of bitcoin and turn it into an</v>

3085
01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:26.000
<v Speaker 6>everyday experience that a person who doesn't want to know about any of the</v>

3086
01:36:26.001 --> 01:36:27.350
<v Speaker 6>geeky stuff about encryption,</v>

3087
01:36:27.351 --> 01:36:27.951
<v Speaker 6>about keys,</v>

3088
01:36:27.951 --> 01:36:29.780
<v Speaker 6>about all of that simply says,</v>

3089
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:35.320
<v Speaker 6>I want to send Joe some money and the wallet is Joe Money Send and all of the</v>

3090
01:36:37.551 --> 01:36:39.620
<v Speaker 6>rest is hidden in the background and we're getting there</v>

3091
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.790
<v Speaker 2>and we are getting there and it's,</v>

3092
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:46.240
<v Speaker 2>it sort of mirrors what's already been done with the Internet so that people</v>

3093
01:36:46.241 --> 01:36:47.260
<v Speaker 2>could sort of see the path.</v>

3094
01:36:47.261 --> 01:36:50.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's some completely new thing that's never been done before.</v>

3095
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.620
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever taken something that was unbelievably complex,</v>

3096
01:36:53.621 --> 01:36:56.230
<v Speaker 2>simplified it and made it mainstream online.</v>

3097
01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:56.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3098
01:36:56.441 --> 01:36:56.861
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>

3099
01:36:56.861 --> 01:36:57.281
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

3100
01:36:57.281 --> 01:36:58.031
<v Speaker 2>you could see it.</v>

3101
01:36:58.031 --> 01:37:00.760
<v Speaker 2>So with bitcoin it's like the path has already lit.</v>

3102
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:03.520
<v Speaker 2>He just have to get people that are brave enough to step forward.</v>

3103
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's obviously happening</v>

3104
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 6>except for one fundamental difference.</v>

3105
01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 6>We don't have to lay hundreds of thousands of miles of new copper and fiber</v>

3106
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 6>line,</v>

3107
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:17.030
<v Speaker 6>don't caption build the physical infrastructure because it's already there.</v>

3108
01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.290
<v Speaker 6>The Internet took,</v>

3109
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:18.861
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3110
01:37:18.861 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 6>a decade and a half to spread in terms of adoption and one of the big issues was</v>

3111
01:37:23.331 --> 01:37:27.620
<v Speaker 6>getting high speed Internet to enough people and then getting fully on all the</v>

3112
01:37:27.621 --> 01:37:28.454
<v Speaker 6>time intranet.</v>

3113
01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 6>You remember the days of dialogue</v>

3114
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:31.520
<v Speaker 2>and but modems going be</v>

3115
01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.360
<v Speaker 2>right and to Carl London now,</v>

3116
01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:44.140
<v Speaker 2>it was impossible to get my mom to do email if she had to first turn on the</v>

3117
01:37:44.211 --> 01:37:46.120
<v Speaker 2>computer and log on Doubleclick,</v>

3118
01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:47.080
<v Speaker 2>start the dialogue,</v>

3119
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.070
<v Speaker 2>do all of this with her phone.</v>

3120
01:37:49.071 --> 01:37:52.520
<v Speaker 2>That made her phone busy so she couldn't actually use it and it would drop off</v>

3121
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:53.354
<v Speaker 2>sometimes too.</v>

3122
01:37:53.410 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>And then connect and sync the EMA that are now</v>

3123
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.030
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

3124
01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:02.030
<v Speaker 6>she swipes her iPad and the email is there and she doesn't know how it works.</v>

3125
01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:03.570
<v Speaker 6>All of this is always on.</v>

3126
01:38:03.571 --> 01:38:04.170
<v Speaker 6>It's Wifi,</v>

3127
01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 6>it's simple,</v>

3128
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:05.041
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

3129
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:05.874
<v Speaker 6>done.</v>

3130
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:08.160
<v Speaker 6>That's the progression we're going to see.</v>

3131
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 6>That's fascinating.</v>

3132
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.033
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3133
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.710
<v Speaker 6>what are right now as of today,</v>

3134
01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

3135
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 6>what are the changes in bitcoin since the last time you were on?</v>

3136
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.070
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3137
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.090
<v Speaker 6>there are some really interesting things happening.</v>

3138
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:21.953
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3139
01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.101
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

3140
01:38:23.101 --> 01:38:23.934
<v Speaker 6>let's see.</v>

3141
01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:25.050
<v Speaker 6>It's been a while.</v>

3142
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:25.291
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3143
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:25.501
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

3144
01:38:25.501 --> 01:38:26.334
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

3145
01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:29.280
<v Speaker 6>in real life it's been two and a half months,</v>

3146
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.280
<v Speaker 6>which in bitcoin terms is like two and a half years.</v>

3147
01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 6>So much has happened is just ridiculous.</v>

3148
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:40.430
<v Speaker 6>One of the interesting things we've seen is serious efforts and results in</v>

3149
01:38:40.441 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 6>building multisignature capabilities.</v>

3150
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we even talked about that last time or maybe we mentioned it</v>

3151
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:47.850
<v Speaker 6>briefly.</v>

3152
01:38:47.850 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 6>What is multisignature capabilities?</v>

3153
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.990
<v Speaker 6>So this is a feature that was added to the core protocol,</v>

3154
01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 6>the bitcoin protocol back in November of 2013 officially and would work.</v>

3155
01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 6>So when you send bitcoin to someone,</v>

3156
01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 6>what you're doing is almost like signing a digital check.</v>

3157
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:07.050
<v Speaker 6>And you're saying from Joe Rogan's wallets and you sign at the bottom to say,</v>

3158
01:39:07.051 --> 01:39:07.261
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

3159
01:39:07.261 --> 01:39:09.630
<v Speaker 6>I'm releasing this money to red band.</v>

3160
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:10.171
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

3161
01:39:10.171 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 6>So you've sent it and the bitcoin network will look at that signature and say,</v>

3162
01:39:13.441 --> 01:39:14.700
<v Speaker 6>that's Joe Rogan signature.</v>

3163
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:15.061
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

3164
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 6>So therefore now the money belongs to read.</v>

3165
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:17.070
<v Speaker 6>Ben,</v>

3166
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:18.090
<v Speaker 6>you've done the transaction.</v>

3167
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.980
<v Speaker 6>So what your wallet is doing,</v>

3168
01:39:19.981 --> 01:39:23.760
<v Speaker 6>what's your phone is doing when it's sending bitcoins to someone?</v>

3169
01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.690
<v Speaker 6>Is it signing a transaction with your key to,</v>

3170
01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:27.511
<v Speaker 6>to basically say,</v>

3171
01:39:27.511 --> 01:39:28.500
<v Speaker 6>I authorize this.</v>

3172
01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.270
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3173
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:33.180
<v Speaker 6>it takes one signature to release the money from your law firm.</v>

3174
01:39:33.181 --> 01:39:37.350
<v Speaker 6>Your Wallet Multisig allows you to build wallets that require multiple</v>

3175
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:38.184
<v Speaker 6>signatures.</v>

3176
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:43.230
<v Speaker 6>So let's say you were running a company and you want it to make sure that every</v>

3177
01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 6>single time you made a bitcoin transaction,</v>

3178
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.720
<v Speaker 6>it had to be signed by the CEO and the chief financial officer,</v>

3179
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:53.363
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3180
01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:54.780
<v Speaker 6>So now you could say,</v>

3181
01:39:54.781 --> 01:39:55.141
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3182
01:39:55.141 --> 01:39:57.840
<v Speaker 6>a requires two out of two signatures.</v>

3183
01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.170
<v Speaker 6>The account has two signatures associated with it.</v>

3184
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 6>Both must sign in order to do that.</v>

3185
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:08.730
<v Speaker 6>Or You could create a joint account between two spouses and you could say a</v>

3186
01:40:08.731 --> 01:40:10.830
<v Speaker 6>requires one of two signatures.</v>

3187
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.700
<v Speaker 6>Here is the signature of one spouse has the signature of the other spouse.</v>

3188
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.590
<v Speaker 6>If either of them signs,</v>

3189
01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.160
<v Speaker 6>you can do it right.</v>

3190
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.320
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3191
01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.710
<v Speaker 6>you could create a trust account where you have,</v>

3192
01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:23.813
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3193
01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:27.330
<v Speaker 6>either the signature of one spouse and a trustee or the other spouse and a</v>

3194
01:40:27.331 --> 01:40:30.720
<v Speaker 6>trustee to sign off for the account of a child.</v>

3195
01:40:30.721 --> 01:40:31.554
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

3196
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:34.770
<v Speaker 6>you could create an escrow account where you say,</v>

3197
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:39.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to sell you Joe something and you send me the bitcoin and I don't</v>

3198
01:40:39.811 --> 01:40:40.644
<v Speaker 6>deliver.</v>

3199
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.360
<v Speaker 6>What happens then that's a problem,</v>

3200
01:40:42.361 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3201
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 6>You can't get a refund.</v>

3202
01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.630
<v Speaker 6>Now instead of that,</v>

3203
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:49.680
<v Speaker 6>you send the Bitcoin to an account that requires to have three signatures,</v>

3204
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.300
<v Speaker 6>your signature,</v>

3205
01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:52.500
<v Speaker 6>my signature,</v>

3206
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 6>and an escrow party,</v>

3207
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.190
<v Speaker 6>a third party that works as an arbitrator between us.</v>

3208
01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 6>So if I send you the stuff that you wanted and you are happy with it,</v>

3209
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:03.220
<v Speaker 6>we both sign,</v>

3210
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:04.383
<v Speaker 6>I get the money,</v>

3211
01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:05.500
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3212
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.333
<v Speaker 6>So you've paid me.</v>

3213
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:08.620
<v Speaker 6>It's like an escrow like you do with paypal and Ebay.</v>

3214
01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:10.900
<v Speaker 6>Right now,</v>

3215
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.160
<v Speaker 6>if we have a dispute,</v>

3216
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 6>you call the arbitrator and you say,</v>

3217
01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm not happy I didn't get this product and you and the arbitrator sign and get</v>

3218
01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 6>the refund,</v>

3219
01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.270
<v Speaker 6>send the money back to you.</v>

3220
01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.480
<v Speaker 6>But if I'm not satisfied,</v>

3221
01:41:25.481 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 6>because I really did send you the product and you just don't want to pay for it,</v>

3222
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 6>I persuade the arbitrator that you're cheating.</v>

3223
01:41:32.230 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 6>I sign it with the arbitrator.</v>

3224
01:41:33.431 --> 01:41:34.600
<v Speaker 6>Two out of three signatures,</v>

3225
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 6>get the money to myself.</v>

3226
01:41:36.101 --> 01:41:41.101
<v Speaker 6>So you can create these complex environments where you can do escrow,</v>

3227
01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.620
<v Speaker 6>you can do trust accounts,</v>

3228
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.280
<v Speaker 6>you can have arbitration,</v>

3229
01:41:45.281 --> 01:41:50.281
<v Speaker 6>third party arbitration for refunds so that you can solve problems and you can</v>

3230
01:41:50.381 --> 01:41:54.670
<v Speaker 6>create more complex forms of transactions that give you better security and</v>

3231
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:55.504
<v Speaker 6>better trust.</v>

3232
01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.181
<v Speaker 5>That seems,</v>

3233
01:41:56.181 --> 01:41:56.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3234
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:59.320
<v Speaker 5>like you would really have to trust the arbitrator and the,</v>

3235
01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:03.950
<v Speaker 5>they would have to somehow or another not being cahoots with one party.</v>

3236
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3237
01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:08.080
<v Speaker 6>So when you use the visa network,</v>

3238
01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.510
<v Speaker 6>you abide by visas,</v>

3239
01:42:10.511 --> 01:42:11.470
<v Speaker 6>arbitration rules,</v>

3240
01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:12.670
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3241
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:16.510
<v Speaker 6>So if you do a charge back and they're going to contact the merchant and say,</v>

3242
01:42:16.511 --> 01:42:16.661
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3243
01:42:16.661 --> 01:42:20.710
<v Speaker 6>show us a signature from this transaction and feess arbitration rules apply</v>

3244
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:21.880
<v Speaker 6>whether you'd like it or not.</v>

3245
01:42:22.210 --> 01:42:23.500
<v Speaker 6>When you use Ebay,</v>

3246
01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:26.920
<v Speaker 6>paypal arbitration rules apply whether you like it or not,</v>

3247
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:30.460
<v Speaker 6>the means of payment determines the rules of arbitration.</v>

3248
01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.400
<v Speaker 5>So that seems like a good opportunity for something like Bank of America to get</v>

3249
01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:36.150
<v Speaker 5>involved with.</v>

3250
01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:36.983
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3251
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.660
<v Speaker 5>Paypal could be one of the arbitrators if you'd like.</v>

3252
01:42:40.110 --> 01:42:40.943
<v Speaker 5>Oh thank you.</v>

3253
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:41.970
<v Speaker 5>If you like the,</v>

3254
01:42:41.971 --> 01:42:42.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3255
01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.520
<v Speaker 5>arbitration rules of that group,</v>

3256
01:42:44.521 --> 01:42:45.354
<v Speaker 5>you could use them.</v>

3257
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:46.320
<v Speaker 5>Here's the,</v>

3258
01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.400
<v Speaker 5>here's the interesting things though.</v>

3259
01:42:47.401 --> 01:42:49.170
<v Speaker 5>What it does is it allows you to say,</v>

3260
01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:55.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have a market of arbitration providers all with different rules and</v>

3261
01:42:55.471 --> 01:42:56.550
<v Speaker 5>different levels of trust.</v>

3262
01:42:56.551 --> 01:43:00.570
<v Speaker 5>And some of them will have very good reviews because people had group could</v>

3263
01:43:00.571 --> 01:43:03.360
<v Speaker 5>experience with them and some of them are specialized in real estate and some of</v>

3264
01:43:03.361 --> 01:43:04.740
<v Speaker 5>them are specialized in um,</v>

3265
01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.000
<v Speaker 5>auction markets.</v>

3266
01:43:06.001 --> 01:43:09.630
<v Speaker 5>And some of them specialize in antiques and some of them are specialized in art</v>

3267
01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.613
<v Speaker 5>or appraisal.</v>

3268
01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.760
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm doing a transaction with you and I want to buy an antique.</v>

3269
01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:18.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to list 200 antique arbitrators.</v>

3270
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:20.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to pick the one with the highest level of refuse.</v>

3271
01:43:20.791 --> 01:43:22.650
<v Speaker 5>He's an experts in appraising antiques.</v>

3272
01:43:22.651 --> 01:43:24.000
<v Speaker 5>He's going to do a good job for us.</v>

3273
01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:24.601
<v Speaker 5>We agree.</v>

3274
01:43:24.601 --> 01:43:25.890
<v Speaker 5>That's the one we want to use.</v>

3275
01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:26.910
<v Speaker 5>Now we've got,</v>

3276
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:30.990
<v Speaker 5>it's opens up all of these possibilities and it creates a whole new market for</v>

3277
01:43:30.991 --> 01:43:31.890
<v Speaker 5>these services.</v>

3278
01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.360
<v Speaker 5>So you've taken trust.</v>

3279
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.910
<v Speaker 5>The was centralized in someone like paypal.</v>

3280
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.630
<v Speaker 5>You didn't have a choice but to use their arbitration and you decentralize it.</v>

3281
01:43:39.631 --> 01:43:43.950
<v Speaker 5>Tonight you have a market where the buyer and the seller can decide what rules</v>

3282
01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 5>apply.</v>

3283
01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:47.700
<v Speaker 5>So do you believe that this is very similar to what we were talking about before</v>

3284
01:43:47.701 --> 01:43:48.271
<v Speaker 5>with banks?</v>

3285
01:43:48.271 --> 01:43:49.980
<v Speaker 5>That one person just has to do it,</v>

3286
01:43:49.981 --> 01:43:50.910
<v Speaker 5>start profiting on it,</v>

3287
01:43:50.911 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 5>and the rush will be</v>

3288
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:54.750
<v Speaker 1>for all the other sort of joining on the bandwagon?</v>

3289
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:59.600
<v Speaker 6>There's already an arbitration market where lawyers and real estate agents and</v>

3290
01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 6>others are providing arbitration services for a small transaction fee like 0.1%</v>

3291
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 6>of the transaction in order to provide escrow capabilities.</v>

3292
01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.400
<v Speaker 6>And you can do that when you buy something with Bitcoin,</v>

3293
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:13.820
<v Speaker 6>you can now use escrow and this is all within the last time you were here.</v>

3294
01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3295
01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:18.560
<v Speaker 6>the technology was nascent and the services were still being built and now</v>

3296
01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:18.850
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

3297
01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 6>they're being built faster.</v>

3298
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:22.790
<v Speaker 6>So that two months really is like two years.</v>

3299
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3300
01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:24.470
<v Speaker 6>Let me give you another example,</v>

3301
01:44:24.471 --> 01:44:25.430
<v Speaker 6>which is really cool.</v>

3302
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.540
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people are worried about their bitcoin being stolen from their wallets</v>

3303
01:44:29.541 --> 01:44:30.530
<v Speaker 6>because of a hack.</v>

3304
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:33.500
<v Speaker 6>So one of the ways you can use multisig,</v>

3305
01:44:33.501 --> 01:44:34.790
<v Speaker 6>which is very interesting,</v>

3306
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:39.320
<v Speaker 6>is to have a two have three account.</v>

3307
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:40.530
<v Speaker 6>And what I mean by two of three,</v>

3308
01:44:40.531 --> 01:44:45.170
<v Speaker 6>it means it has three signatures registered and you require at least two of</v>

3309
01:44:45.171 --> 01:44:48.050
<v Speaker 6>those three signatures in order to authorize the transaction.</v>

3310
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:50.090
<v Speaker 6>You keep one,</v>

3311
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.790
<v Speaker 6>you keep another one as a backup,</v>

3312
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.530
<v Speaker 6>put it printed on paper,</v>

3313
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:55.341
<v Speaker 6>put it in a safe,</v>

3314
01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:57.980
<v Speaker 6>that's your recovery in case something goes wrong.</v>

3315
01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 6>And then you give the third signature to a service that checks every transaction</v>

3316
01:45:02.601 --> 01:45:03.434
<v Speaker 6>for risk.</v>

3317
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 6>And what they do is when you make a payment,</v>

3318
01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:06.850
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3319
01:45:06.850 --> 01:45:08.870
<v Speaker 6>they look at the merchant that you paid,</v>

3320
01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:09.800
<v Speaker 6>they look at their history,</v>

3321
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:11.540
<v Speaker 6>they look at what kind of amount it is.</v>

3322
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:12.620
<v Speaker 6>Is this usual,</v>

3323
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:16.430
<v Speaker 6>is it like $10 and you normally spend that or did you just suddenly tried to</v>

3324
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:19.880
<v Speaker 6>transfer half a million dollars out of your accounts and wipe it clean to a</v>

3325
01:45:19.881 --> 01:45:21.650
<v Speaker 6>random address they've never seen before.</v>

3326
01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 6>And so based on that,</v>

3327
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:26.150
<v Speaker 6>they're going to risk score it and then they're going to call you,</v>

3328
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 6>they're going to send you a text message and say,</v>

3329
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 6>we seeing a transaction here,</v>

3330
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:32.720
<v Speaker 6>you've requested for two and a half thousand dollars to merchant we've never</v>

3331
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:34.430
<v Speaker 6>seen before that you normally don't do.</v>

3332
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.050
<v Speaker 6>Are you sure you know,</v>

3333
01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:38.540
<v Speaker 6>respond one for authorizing this transaction,</v>

3334
01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:39.890
<v Speaker 6>respond to to cancel it.</v>

3335
01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.430
<v Speaker 6>And if it's a really big one,</v>

3336
01:45:42.431 --> 01:45:44.890
<v Speaker 6>maybe they're going to call you on the phone and you're going to speak to Jim</v>

3337
01:45:44.891 --> 01:45:45.850
<v Speaker 6>and Jim is going to say,</v>

3338
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3339
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.370
<v Speaker 6>can you please give me the last four of your social,</v>

3340
01:45:48.371 --> 01:45:49.210
<v Speaker 6>I want to check this,</v>

3341
01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.140
<v Speaker 6>whatever you can,</v>

3342
01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:55.710
<v Speaker 6>you can reintroduce some of the fraud prevention systems that banks do.</v>

3343
01:45:56.710 --> 01:46:00.850
<v Speaker 6>But the really cool thing is now that's a market instead of having to do it with</v>

3344
01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:02.080
<v Speaker 6>your payment provider,</v>

3345
01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.300
<v Speaker 6>you can pick who gives you a risk service.</v>

3346
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3347
01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:07.610
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating,</v>

3348
01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:12.611
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of along the same lines of the difference between apple locking</v>

3349
01:46:12.831 --> 01:46:13.700
<v Speaker 1>everything down.</v>

3350
01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:14.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3351
01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.134
<v Speaker 1>it's secure.</v>

3352
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:19.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a virus from an APP and the wild world of like,</v>

3353
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.720
<v Speaker 1>like say perfect example would be like a bit torrent.</v>

3354
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3355
01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Fucking download a program from bit torrent.</v>

3356
01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Good lucks on.</v>

3357
01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Better Cross your fingers because you never know.</v>

3358
01:46:32.201 --> 01:46:33.160
<v Speaker 1>What the hell are you going to get?</v>

3359
01:46:33.161 --> 01:46:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3360
01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:34.720
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing.</v>

3361
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3362
01:46:35.410 --> 01:46:35.751
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3363
01:46:35.751 --> 01:46:37.240
<v Speaker 1>these pickles are God damn delicious.</v>

3364
01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:39.940
<v Speaker 1>If you want to pick over Grillo's pickles sent us some,</v>

3365
01:46:39.941 --> 01:46:40.150

01:46:41.351 --> 01:46:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Have you had the sweet ones?</v>

3368
01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3369
01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.530

3373
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:50.460

<v Speaker 5>Only people.</v>

3376
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:51.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3377
01:46:51.631 --> 01:46:51.811
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3378
01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:52.710
<v Speaker 5>you can get them delivered.</v>

3379
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.360
<v Speaker 5>Grillo's pickles.com delivers.</v>

3380
01:46:54.361 --> 01:46:56.700
<v Speaker 5>Now they're the nicest guys that were too.</v>

3381
01:46:56.701 --> 01:46:58.440
<v Speaker 5>They came to our show in Boston and they were,</v>

3382
01:46:58.450 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 5>if he gave out free pickles to the whole crowd,</v>

3383
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:00.871
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3384
01:47:00.871 --> 01:47:03.690
<v Speaker 5>probably like a million dollars for the pickles and handed it out to 2000</v>

3385
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:04.380
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

3386
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.213
<v Speaker 5>It's all fresh jail.</v>

3387
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.263
<v Speaker 5>They take bitcoin,</v>

3388
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:09.810
<v Speaker 5>they should those pickles good on the ball badge.</v>

3389
01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.330
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't really start bitcoin now.</v>

3390
01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:12.721
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3391
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:12.851
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3392
01:47:12.851 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 5>like if I wanted to buy Bitcoin,</v>

3393
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't want to start now.</v>

3394
01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:18.690
<v Speaker 5>I would wait when await because I'm not going to spend what,</v>

3395
01:47:18.691 --> 01:47:21.000
<v Speaker 5>$500 for a single bitcoin.</v>

3396
01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:22.560
<v Speaker 5>Can you buy pieces of Bitcoin?</v>

3397
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:24.710
<v Speaker 5>You can buy first small amounts we can.</v>

3398
01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:25.613
<v Speaker 5>Where do you do that?</v>

3399
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.241
<v Speaker 5>So most of the,</v>

3400
01:47:27.241 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3401
01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:30.270
<v Speaker 5>most of the exchanges or place where you can buy Bitcoin,</v>

3402
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.380
<v Speaker 5>you can probably buy like,</v>

3403
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 5>I think the minimum is $20 for something like that worth.</v>

3404
01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:35.490
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3405
01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:36.350
<v Speaker 5>So you can buy a,</v>

3406
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:37.980
<v Speaker 5>a 20th of a bitcoin.</v>

3407
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.931
<v Speaker 5>Theoretically,</v>

3408
01:47:39.931 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 5>you could go and buy a hundred millions of a bitcoin if somebody who was willing</v>

3409
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:43.771
<v Speaker 5>to sell it to you.</v>

3410
01:47:43.771 --> 01:47:44.051
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

3411
01:47:44.051 --> 01:47:44.820
<v Speaker 5>usually the,</v>

3412
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:47.370
<v Speaker 5>it's not worth doing for them at that amount.</v>

3413
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:48.663
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3414
01:47:48.930 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 5>so you can divide it as much as he wants.</v>

3415
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.060
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3416
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.520
<v Speaker 5>you do not need to spend an enormous amount.</v>

3417
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.110
<v Speaker 5>And then again,</v>

3418
01:47:55.111 --> 01:47:56.790
<v Speaker 5>the thing is what are you gonna use it for?</v>

3419
01:47:56.791 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

3420
01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.090
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to try and use bitcoin to invest in Bitcoin,</v>

3421
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:00.871
<v Speaker 5>be very,</v>

3422
01:48:00.871 --> 01:48:01.704
<v Speaker 5>very careful.</v>

3423
01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:06.990
<v Speaker 5>Do not take your retirement funds and all of your savings and dump them into</v>

3424
01:48:06.991 --> 01:48:09.390
<v Speaker 5>this wild ride that is not smart.</v>

3425
01:48:09.450 --> 01:48:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3426
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.550
<v Speaker 5>And I need to say that again and again.</v>

3427
01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:12.720
<v Speaker 5>People don't do that.</v>

3428
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:13.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3429
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 5>I've done some of that and it's not prudent,</v>

3430
01:48:16.501 --> 01:48:19.380
<v Speaker 5>but my career is tied to this.</v>

3431
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the industry,</v>

3432
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 5>this is not for the mainstream investor.</v>

3433
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 5>And it's not really an investment,</v>

3434
01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.310
<v Speaker 5>but I'm sorry,</v>

3435
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:27.323
<v Speaker 5>who's cool.</v>

3436
01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:32.540
<v Speaker 5>Maybe put a couple of percentage points of a nicely diversified portfolio like</v>

3437
01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:33.001
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3438
01:48:33.001 --> 01:48:33.601
<v Speaker 5>I'll throw,</v>

3439
01:48:33.601 --> 01:48:33.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3440
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:36.600
<v Speaker 5>$1,000 maybe $2,000 if I lose it,</v>

3441
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:37.231
<v Speaker 5>I lose it.</v>

3442
01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:37.831
<v Speaker 5>If I don't,</v>

3443
01:48:37.831 --> 01:48:39.130
<v Speaker 5>in the meantime I can play with it.</v>

3444
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.380
<v Speaker 5>I can buy a bit of bit coin,</v>

3445
01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:41.850
<v Speaker 5>learn about the technology,</v>

3446
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:44.040
<v Speaker 5>feel like I'm part of an early adopter thing.</v>

3447
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:45.143
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

3448
01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Don't go putting all your money in bitcoin.</v>

3449
01:48:46.981 --> 01:48:47.814
<v Speaker 5>That's not smart.</v>

3450
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:48.451
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

3451
01:48:48.451 --> 01:48:53.451
<v Speaker 5>That one dude who had like $9 million in bitcoin in a hard drive and he couldn't</v>

3452
01:48:53.461 --> 01:48:54.060
<v Speaker 5>find it,</v>

3453
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:57.480
<v Speaker 5>so he was going to the dump with a fine tooth comb trying to figure out where</v>

3454
01:48:57.481 --> 01:48:58.470
<v Speaker 5>that hard drive was.</v>

3455
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:59.703
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember that story?</v>

3456
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:00.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3457
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.990
<v Speaker 5>Well fortunately he didn't buy that bitcoin.</v>

3458
01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:06.300
<v Speaker 5>He was just one of the people who were involved in mining several years back and</v>

3459
01:49:06.301 --> 01:49:09.320
<v Speaker 5>then he forgot about it and then he realized this whole hard drive heats thrown</v>

3460
01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:09.520
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

3461
01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:12.360
<v Speaker 5>Ashley had a wallet which had seven and a half thousand bitcoin on it or</v>

3462
01:49:12.361 --> 01:49:13.194
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3463
01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.450
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious by the way.</v>

3464
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 5>But it's no loss.</v>

3465
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:19.350
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have treasure hunters as a new occupation.</v>

3466
01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:22.200
<v Speaker 5>It's no loss because he didn't actually have it.</v>

3467
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:22.621
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3468
01:49:22.621 --> 01:49:23.130
<v Speaker 5>he didn't.</v>

3469
01:49:23.130 --> 01:49:23.963
<v Speaker 5>He didn't.</v>

3470
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:24.810
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3471
01:49:24.810 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 5>but if he had it,</v>

3472
01:49:25.770 --> 01:49:26.603
<v Speaker 5>he would have it.</v>

3473
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.050
<v Speaker 5>It could be a gain loss.</v>

3474
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:28.973
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3475
01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:29.843
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking law.</v>

3476
01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:30.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3477
01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:32.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to keep the dude from committing suicide.</v>

3478
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:33.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3479
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:33.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3480
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:34.170
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

3481
01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to create a whole new treasure hunting business.</v>

3482
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:38.760
<v Speaker 5>People are going to start,</v>

3483
01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3484
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:40.290
<v Speaker 5>and already we've seen this.</v>

3485
01:49:40.291 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 5>People buy old computers on Ebay.</v>

3486
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:47.220
<v Speaker 5>Go through the hard drives and find wallets on them or porn or financial</v>

3487
01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.153
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

3488
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:49.240
<v Speaker 5>Identity theft.</v>

3489
01:49:49.410 --> 01:49:49.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3490
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:50.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3491
01:49:50.021 --> 01:49:50.590
<v Speaker 5>You got to be,</v>

3492
01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:51.850
<v Speaker 5>people need to know that too.</v>

3493
01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:52.930
<v Speaker 5>If you get rid of a hard drive,</v>

3494
01:49:52.931 --> 01:49:54.710
<v Speaker 5>you've got to wipe that bitch clean a strike.</v>

3495
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:55.600
<v Speaker 5>You have to do more than that.</v>

3496
01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:55.931
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

3497
01:49:55.931 --> 01:49:57.200
<v Speaker 5>you gave me a bunch of your hard drives out,</v>

3498
01:49:57.210 --> 01:49:57.851
<v Speaker 5>wipe them clean by.</v>

3499
01:49:57.851 --> 01:50:00.400
<v Speaker 5>Still didn't throw them away because I know that there's programs out there that</v>

3500
01:50:00.401 --> 01:50:01.121
<v Speaker 5>could just do that.</v>

3501
01:50:01.121 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 5>So now I'm thinking like,</v>

3502
01:50:02.230 --> 01:50:02.661
<v Speaker 5>what do you do?</v>

3503
01:50:02.661 --> 01:50:05.110
<v Speaker 5>You just dip them in acid or we should shoot him.</v>

3504
01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Take him to the place sheet.</v>

3505
01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:07.270
<v Speaker 5>That'd be fine.</v>

3506
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.681
<v Speaker 5>Let's do it.</v>

3507
01:50:07.681 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 5>Let's do it.</v>

3508
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>

3509
01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 5>well we're having this conversation at the very moment.</v>

3510
01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.000
<v Speaker 5>We're having this conversation,</v>

3511
01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:15.340
<v Speaker 5>like my watch keeps buzzing every now and then.</v>

3512
01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 5>What do you got on your watch?</v>

3513
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:18.010
<v Speaker 5>It's a pebble.</v>

3514
01:50:18.010 --> 01:50:19.450
<v Speaker 5>It's a smartwatch.</v>

3515
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.691
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3516
01:50:19.691 --> 01:50:20.411
<v Speaker 5>how dare you.</v>

3517
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:21.280
<v Speaker 5>You're one of those guys.</v>

3518
01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:21.611
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3519
01:50:21.611 --> 01:50:22.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting Bitcoin,</v>

3520
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.470
<v Speaker 5>not notifications of people tipping me over Twitter as we're speaking.</v>

3521
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.641
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

3522
01:50:27.641 --> 01:50:28.091
<v Speaker 5>very cool.</v>

3523
01:50:28.091 --> 01:50:29.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting here and as I say things,</v>

3524
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:30.160
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

3525
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 5>if I say something that people like my watch buzzes a bit because people start</v>

3526
01:50:33.821 --> 01:50:34.654
<v Speaker 5>sending me tips.</v>

3527
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.210
<v Speaker 5>So that's pretty cool.</v>

3528
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty cool.</v>

3529
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 5>And now it's buzzing lots.</v>

3530
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Once I said deal from you,</v>

3531
01:50:41.081 --> 01:50:41.621
<v Speaker 5>can they be like,</v>

3532
01:50:41.621 --> 01:50:42.221
<v Speaker 5>fuck you?</v>

3533
01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:43.660
<v Speaker 5>Can you get like a negative shock?</v>

3534
01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 5>Could you say something stupid?</v>

3535
01:50:45.461 --> 01:50:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Are you willing to take a chance?</v>

3536
01:50:47.050 --> 01:50:48.640
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a,</v>

3537
01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:49.001
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3538
01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:49.481
<v Speaker 5>that's what I said.</v>

3539
01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:50.350
<v Speaker 5>If you're an entrepreneur,</v>

3540
01:50:50.351 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 5>there was an opportunity.</v>

3541
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3542
01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:53.873
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3543
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 5>Pay someone to wear a shock collar that's written by Bitcoin.</v>

3544
01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.860
<v Speaker 5>So I got my blocked,</v>

3545
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:59.381
<v Speaker 5>I just read,</v>

3546
01:50:59.381 --> 01:51:02.500
<v Speaker 5>downloaded my blockchain app and uh,</v>

3547
01:51:02.501 --> 01:51:02.791
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3548
01:51:02.791 --> 01:51:03.101
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3549
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:04.390
<v Speaker 5>just checking to see I,</v>

3550
01:51:04.570 --> 01:51:06.310
<v Speaker 5>what number am I,</v>

3551
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:07.150
<v Speaker 5>should I give out?</v>

3552
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:07.931
<v Speaker 5>People were like,</v>

3553
01:51:07.931 --> 01:51:08.261
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

3554
01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:09.300
<v Speaker 5>what's your number?</v>

3555
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:10.930
<v Speaker 5>Address this address right here,</v>

3556
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.680
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3557
01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.190
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3558
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:13.760
<v Speaker 5>there's no dangers of giving her,</v>

3559
01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:14.613
<v Speaker 5>people were telling me,</v>

3560
01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:14.770
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3561
01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:16.330
<v Speaker 5>it's like giving out your email address.</v>

3562
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:17.020
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3563
01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:20.530
<v Speaker 5>Better actually because it doesn't reveal any information about where you are or</v>

3564
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:21.970
<v Speaker 5>who you are or any of that.</v>

3565
01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:22.330
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3566
01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:24.460
<v Speaker 5>Well it allows people to do is send you money.</v>

3567
01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.533
<v Speaker 5>Sweet.</v>

3568
01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:27.070
<v Speaker 5>And that's nice because you can,</v>

3569
01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.630
<v Speaker 5>you can put that down on the tee shirt.</v>

3570
01:51:28.631 --> 01:51:29.680
<v Speaker 5>You can put it on a QR code.</v>

3571
01:51:29.681 --> 01:51:29.921
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3572
01:51:29.921 --> 01:51:34.921
<v Speaker 5>there was this guy who went to a football game with a giant Qr code date printed</v>

3573
01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:39.250
<v Speaker 5>and during the ESPN coverage when they were on the Jumbo Tron,</v>

3574
01:51:39.251 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 5>they held it up and it said,</v>

3575
01:51:40.241 --> 01:51:41.920
<v Speaker 5>pay for my college or something like that.</v>

3576
01:51:42.490 --> 01:51:44.880
<v Speaker 5>They made like two and a half grand or in,</v>

3577
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 5>in a matter of minutes because people would see it on TV,</v>

3578
01:51:47.651 --> 01:51:49.480
<v Speaker 5>take a snapshot and send them a little bit coin.</v>

3579
01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:50.770
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3580
01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

3581
01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:56.230
<v Speaker 5>There's a congressman who went to a recent meeting wearing a sandwich board with</v>

3582
01:51:56.231 --> 01:51:59.310
<v Speaker 5>a Qr Code on the front where you could donate bid bitcoin to.</v>

3583
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:00.730
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3584
01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:01.870
<v Speaker 5>It's perfectly safe.</v>

3585
01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:02.561
<v Speaker 5>You could publish that.</v>

3586
01:52:02.561 --> 01:52:04.600
<v Speaker 5>You can put it on posters around the city if he wants to.</v>

3587
01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.433
<v Speaker 5>My tweet it right now.</v>

3588
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:06.700
<v Speaker 5>That's fantastic.</v>

3589
01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:07.870
<v Speaker 5>That's when to Joe.</v>

3590
01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:11.830
<v Speaker 5>So many people ask me for your bitcoin address so they could send you bitcoin.</v>

3591
01:52:13.050 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 5>Tell me what it is if you still have the application.</v>

3592
01:52:15.431 --> 01:52:16.061
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

3593
01:52:16.061 --> 01:52:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3594
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:17.703
<v Speaker 5>We'll give it out.</v>

3595
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:18.633
<v Speaker 5>We'll see what happens.</v>

3596
01:52:18.670 --> 01:52:20.290
<v Speaker 5>If somebody sent me one too and I'm like,</v>

3597
01:52:20.291 --> 01:52:21.180
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck did you begin?</v>

3598
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 5>I know it's really funny.</v>

3599
01:52:22.961 --> 01:52:23.590
<v Speaker 5>The the,</v>

3600
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:23.860
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3601
01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.300
<v Speaker 5>the watch is buzzing all the time.</v>

3602
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Watch.</v>

3603
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.101
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a,</v>

3604
01:52:27.101 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big fan of that Dick Tracy Watch.</v>

3605
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:30.190
<v Speaker 5>That shit's ridiculous.</v>

3606
01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:31.960
<v Speaker 5>I only use it.</v>

3607
01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to use it for most of the time for notifications on trip it when</v>

3608
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:36.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm traveling it tells you like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>

3611
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:41.200
<v Speaker 5>that's useful.</v>

3612
01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:42.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3613
01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:43.780

3616
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3617
01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 6>What's the difference between the Samsungs and the pebble and I don't know.</v>

3618
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:54.680
<v Speaker 6>I got this as a gift a and just the only one I've ever used and I'm just still</v>

3619
01:52:54.681 --> 01:52:55.514
<v Speaker 6>playing with it.</v>

3620
01:52:55.910 --> 01:53:00.080
<v Speaker 6>So here's something weird that happened to me after the first Joe Rogan my</v>

3621
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:00.810
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

3622
01:53:00.810 --> 01:53:01.091
<v Speaker 6>Yet.</v>

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.060
<v Speaker 6>right after I got some big in front of a camera with that.</v>

3627
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:10.460
<v Speaker 6>How will that work?</v>

3628
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 6>People can see the Qr Code on,</v>

3629
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:13.730
<v Speaker 6>on your phone.</v>

3630
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 6>You can hold it up to the camera that's pointing at me over there behind you</v>

3631
01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:18.850
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3632
01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:21.740
<v Speaker 6>and that will and uh,</v>

3633
01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:25.400
<v Speaker 6>is that going to work there you go right there.</v>

3634
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.180
<v Speaker 6>Once the,</v>

3635
01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:26.450
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3636
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 6>once the brightness that's good.</v>

3637
01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:29.390
<v Speaker 6>Stabilizes.</v>

3638
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:29.781
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3639
01:53:29.781 --> 01:53:32.240
<v Speaker 6>but you can publish that address and that's a,</v>

3640
01:53:32.241 --> 01:53:34.370
<v Speaker 6>that's Joe Rogan's bitcoin address right there.</v>

3641
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:37.970
<v Speaker 6>And hopefully you can say hello to Joe with money</v>

3642
01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:42.470
<v Speaker 6>and you can publish it later and you can just copy that,</v>

3643
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.200
<v Speaker 6>put it in an email or give me any real money.</v>

3644
01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:46.550
<v Speaker 6>I'll donate it to charity by the way.</v>

3645
01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:47.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3646
01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.620
<v Speaker 6>just to let you know that's,</v>

3647
01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:50.720
<v Speaker 6>that's always a good thing to do and by the way,</v>

3648
01:53:50.721 --> 01:53:52.310
<v Speaker 6>charity is,</v>

3649
01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:57.380
<v Speaker 6>has become one of the dominant forms of payments in bitcoin.</v>

3650
01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:01.940
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people who are doing a lot with charity and it's because you can send</v>

3651
01:54:01.941 --> 01:54:03.020
<v Speaker 6>money very quickly.</v>

3652
01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 6>You can see how the money is being spent.</v>

3653
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 6>There's this fantastic charity that I'd like to mention,</v>

3654
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:09.800
<v Speaker 6>which is based in Pensacola,</v>

3655
01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:10.490
<v Speaker 6>Florida,</v>

3656
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:14.000
<v Speaker 6>where they've made it pretty much illegal to be homeless,</v>

3657
01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:19.210
<v Speaker 6>the first band sleeping outdoors than they banned blankets and they tried to</v>

3658
01:54:19.941 --> 01:54:23.550
<v Speaker 6>solve the homeless problem by bossing them into other cities around and kick</v>

3659
01:54:23.551 --> 01:54:24.860
<v Speaker 6>them out of the area.</v>

3660
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:25.521
<v Speaker 6>I support that.</v>

3661
01:54:25.521 --> 01:54:26.220
<v Speaker 6>How do we do that?</v>

3662
01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:29.180
<v Speaker 6>Sweet Brian,</v>

3663
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:30.650
<v Speaker 6>you've missed the point.</v>

3664
01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 6>The point is that's evil.</v>

3665
01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:34.100
<v Speaker 6>Those poor people are poor.</v>

3666
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:34.821
<v Speaker 6>Actually.</v>

3667
01:54:34.821 --> 01:54:38.390
<v Speaker 6>Most of them are veterans coming back from the war and having no jobs in having</v>

3668
01:54:38.391 --> 01:54:40.760
<v Speaker 6>PTSD and no treatments and I don't know if most of them,</v>

3669
01:54:40.761 --> 01:54:45.761
<v Speaker 6>but there are quite a few 40% 40% of the homeless population in this country is</v>

3670
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 6>made up of veterans.</v>

3671
01:54:47.690 --> 01:54:48.500
<v Speaker 6>That's a shame.</v>

3672
01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:49.011
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3673
01:54:49.011 --> 01:54:49.460
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3674
01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:54.460
<v Speaker 6>Jason King from Sean's outpost children's health post.com started collecting</v>

3675
01:54:54.801 --> 01:54:59.600
<v Speaker 6>money for with bitcoin and use that money last year in the first year of the</v>

3676
01:54:59.601 --> 01:55:04.190
<v Speaker 6>charity to feed 60,000 meals to the homeless people of Pensacola,</v>

3677
01:55:04.191 --> 01:55:05.000
<v Speaker 6>Florida.</v>

3678
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 6>And managed to create fundraising events from all around the world and to</v>

3679
01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:14.081
<v Speaker 6>convert that money very effectively into food for people who desperately needed.</v>

3680
01:55:14.150 --> 01:55:15.320
<v Speaker 6>And that's just one example,</v>

3681
01:55:15.321 --> 01:55:19.100
<v Speaker 6>is a lot of charity a bit give the bit gift foundation,</v>

3682
01:55:19.101 --> 01:55:22.610
<v Speaker 6>which coordinates charitable giving a hundred bitcoins,</v>

3683
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:27.640
<v Speaker 6>which is a charity that will literally give a 100 bitcoins to any charity that</v>

3684
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:29.060
<v Speaker 6>wants to take bitcoin.</v>

3685
01:55:29.061 --> 01:55:29.870
<v Speaker 6>They already have,</v>

3686
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:32.300
<v Speaker 6>they've raised the money and now they're trying to find charities to give the</v>

3687
01:55:32.301 --> 01:55:33.110
<v Speaker 6>money away to.</v>

3688
01:55:33.110 --> 01:55:33.943
<v Speaker 6>How can I,</v>

3689
01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.170
<v Speaker 6>I mean that was just an image.</v>

3690
01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:38.000
<v Speaker 6>That thing was just an image.</v>

3691
01:55:38.230 --> 01:55:39.720
<v Speaker 6>The the the Bitcoin,</v>

3692
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:40.380
<v Speaker 6>the Barcode.</v>

3693
01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:40.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3694
01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:41.363
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is.</v>

3695
01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:42.440
<v Speaker 6>How do you,</v>

3696
01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.950
<v Speaker 6>how would I put that online</v>

3697
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:45.090
<v Speaker 5>so I can,</v>

3698
01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:45.923
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

3699
01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I've received one screenshot.</v>

3700
01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I've received one w o 0.01</v>

3701
01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:57.260
<v Speaker 5>it's already happening approximately $4 and 92 cents for 20 years.</v>

3702
01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:57.951
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

3703
01:55:57.951 --> 01:55:58.940
<v Speaker 5>My phone's blowing up.</v>

3704
01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:04.570
<v Speaker 5>This has got five bitcoins or five donations just from that stupid image.</v>

3705
01:56:05.931 --> 01:56:06.770
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>

3706
01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.570
<v Speaker 5>What if I put that image online?</v>

3707
01:56:08.571 --> 01:56:10.940
<v Speaker 5>How do you make a screenshot with an android phone?</v>

3708
01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:12.321
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

3709
01:56:12.321 --> 01:56:15.680
<v Speaker 5>I can send you a Qr Code that corresponds to your address is fairly easy for me</v>

3710
01:56:15.681 --> 01:56:16.401
<v Speaker 5>to generate it.</v>

3711
01:56:16.401 --> 01:56:20.450
<v Speaker 5>You can share that Qr code through the application or you can just post the</v>

3712
01:56:20.451 --> 01:56:21.470
<v Speaker 5>address above it.</v>

3713
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.330
<v Speaker 5>The QR code is just the address.</v>

3714
01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.540
<v Speaker 5>It's the same number that starts with a one.</v>

3715
01:56:26.541 --> 01:56:29.520
<v Speaker 5>That long series of digits is just in the form of a barcode.</v>

3716
01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:30.373
<v Speaker 5>To make it easier,</v>

3717
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I need to find out how you screenshot with the galaxy.</v>

3718
01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Note three.</v>

3719
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I use mine I,</v>

3720
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 1>there's different ways you can do it.</v>

3721
01:56:36.571 --> 01:56:36.811
<v Speaker 1>Mine,</v>

3722
01:56:36.811 --> 01:56:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I just swipe my hand from left or right eye over the screen and I do the</v>

3723
01:56:41.171 --> 01:56:41.761
<v Speaker 1>screenshot,</v>

3724
01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:41.961
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3725
01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I think I chose to do that through the sections.</v>

3726
01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3727
01:56:46.410 --> 01:56:47.191
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way,</v>

3728
01:56:47.191 --> 01:56:48.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3729
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3730
01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.270
<v Speaker 1>But there's got to be like an easier way.</v>

3731
01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3732
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Was like a button you press or something like that.</v>

3733
01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Open settings,</v>

3734
01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.830
<v Speaker 1>motions and gestures.</v>

3735
01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:55.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3736
01:56:55.981 --> 01:56:56.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way to do it.</v>

3737
01:56:58.230 --> 01:56:59.063
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3738
01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:00.660
<v Speaker 5>That's s five.</v>

3739
01:57:00.661 --> 01:57:01.494
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't always work.</v>

3740
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:01.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3741
01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:03.540
<v Speaker 5>But before we're done with the show,</v>

3742
01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:03.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3743
01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:06.570
<v Speaker 5>I'll get that barcode ready for you.</v>

3744
01:57:06.571 --> 01:57:08.700
<v Speaker 5>You could post it on this show and see what happens.</v>

3745
01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:09.171
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3746
01:57:09.171 --> 01:57:13.010
<v Speaker 1>You press the power button and the home button at the same time.</v>

3747
01:57:13.730 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Power.</v>

3748
01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:15.740
<v Speaker 1>But so how did he get those?</v>

3749
01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:17.990
<v Speaker 1>How did he get that cool bar on his,</v>

3750
01:57:19.190 --> 01:57:19.790
<v Speaker 1>the Barcode?</v>

3751
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3752
01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:22.790
<v Speaker 1>You just touched the Barcode on the home screen of your application.</v>

3753
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3754
01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:23.990
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3755
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to it.</v>

3756
01:57:24.521 --> 01:57:25.354
<v Speaker 1>We'll make it bigger.</v>

3757
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send this image,</v>

3758
01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put it on Instagram and then we'll see what's up.</v>

3759
01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if this does something.</v>

3760
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:40.580
<v Speaker 1>If you click on the receive button,</v>

3761
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.510
<v Speaker 1>right Ben?</v>

3762
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:42.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3763
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And then I think it's one of the tabs at the bottom.</v>

3764
01:57:44.571 --> 01:57:45.404
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

3765
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:48.710
<v Speaker 5>when you do,</v>

3766
01:57:48.710 --> 01:57:49.220
<v Speaker 5>you've got the,</v>

3767
01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:49.491
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3768
01:57:49.491 --> 01:57:53.120
<v Speaker 5>The problem is they won't let us make new iPhone application as is lagging</v>

3769
01:57:53.121 --> 01:57:53.850
<v Speaker 5>behind.</v>

3770
01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:54.111
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3771
01:57:54.111 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>

3772
01:57:54.570 --> 01:57:55.041
<v Speaker 5>Stay still.</v>

3773
01:57:55.041 --> 01:57:56.090
<v Speaker 5>Let me download it though,</v>

3774
01:57:56.091 --> 01:57:59.690
<v Speaker 5>because I got a new iPhone the other day and they still let me download the old</v>

3775
01:57:59.691 --> 01:58:01.250
<v Speaker 5>program off the iTunes store.</v>

3776
01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:01.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3777
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:03.650
<v Speaker 5>maybe because you already had it on your iTunes.</v>

3778
01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:04.790
<v Speaker 5>If you already own something,</v>

3779
01:58:04.791 --> 01:58:05.511
<v Speaker 5>you are still allowed to,</v>

3780
01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:05.650
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3781
01:58:05.650 --> 01:58:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Redownload it for somehow.</v>

3782
01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:07.913
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3783
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3784
01:58:09.010 --> 01:58:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3785
01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:10.750
<v Speaker 1>So even if it's gone.</v>

3786
01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3787
01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.460
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3788
01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:12.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3789
01:58:12.671 --> 01:58:13.241
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like,</v>

3790
01:58:13.241 --> 01:58:15.130
<v Speaker 1>so people that spent money on something,</v>

3791
01:58:15.131 --> 01:58:15.530
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

3792
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:17.980
<v Speaker 1>they still own that product so they can't really take it away.</v>

3793
01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:18.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3794
01:58:18.611 --> 01:58:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I just instagrammed it,</v>

3795
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:23.500
<v Speaker 1>which means it also went to my Twitter and my Facebook.</v>

3796
01:58:23.501 --> 01:58:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So almost 2 million people have access to that image right now.</v>

3797
01:58:28.211 --> 01:58:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if my phone exploded.</v>

3798
01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:31.671
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3799
01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:32.031
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3800
01:58:32.031 --> 01:58:33.680
<v Speaker 5>I've had that happen with an explosive,</v>

3801
01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.680
<v Speaker 5>let me tell you a great story of a fundraising using bitcoin.</v>

3802
01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:40.970
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear about this story with music week where they came out and said,</v>

3803
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 5>we found the</v>

3804
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 6>creator of Bitcoin?</v>

3805
01:58:43.230 --> 01:58:43.531
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

3806
01:58:43.531 --> 01:58:44.364
<v Speaker 9>The Comodo</v>

3807
01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.470
<v Speaker 1>the thing I wanted to talk to you about most today.</v>

3808
01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3809
01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.840
<v Speaker 6>I have a great story for you,</v>

3810
01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.470
<v Speaker 6>exactly about what happens and we've got a video online to share as well.</v>

3811
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:53.343
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3812
01:58:53.490 --> 01:58:57.750
<v Speaker 6>So I was a conference the morning I found out about this and I looked into it</v>

3813
01:58:57.751 --> 01:59:01.890
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of people in the bitcoin space are interested in who Satoshi Nakamoto</v>

3814
01:59:01.891 --> 01:59:02.041
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

3815
01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:03.600
<v Speaker 6>There have been a lot of research.</v>

3816
01:59:03.930 --> 01:59:07.830
<v Speaker 6>I think we should leave the person alone and it's probably not going to be good</v>

3817
01:59:07.831 --> 01:59:10.740
<v Speaker 6>to find out who it is because all it's gonna do is smear that person.</v>

3818
01:59:11.370 --> 01:59:13.080
<v Speaker 6>They're going to try and smear him.</v>

3819
01:59:13.110 --> 01:59:15.840
<v Speaker 6>So I would rather not know because it doesn't matter.</v>

3820
01:59:15.841 --> 01:59:17.430
<v Speaker 6>It's the math is what matters,</v>

3821
01:59:17.431 --> 01:59:18.330
<v Speaker 6>not who it is,</v>

3822
01:59:19.170 --> 01:59:22.080
<v Speaker 6>but people are all variously curious.</v>

3823
01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:23.213
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3824
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:25.470
<v Speaker 6>when I found out about this,</v>

3825
01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:25.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>There's no doubt in anyone's mind at this point and was awake,</v>

3972
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:12.370
<v Speaker 6>fucked up big time and they got it wrong and worse.</v>

3973
02:03:12.490 --> 02:03:13.330
<v Speaker 6>They doxed him,</v>

3974
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:14.470
<v Speaker 6>as we say on the Internet,</v>

3975
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:19.450
<v Speaker 6>they produce pictures of his home address and his car registration plate.</v>

3976
02:03:19.690 --> 02:03:21.750
<v Speaker 6>And so he got swamped and not just by journalists,</v>

3977
02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:23.950
<v Speaker 6>he got swamped by crazies,</v>

3978
02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.630
<v Speaker 6>by a really crazy dangerous people who suddenly thought he was a rich person and</v>

3979
02:03:28.631 --> 02:03:30.100
<v Speaker 6>wanted a piece of the action.</v>

3980
02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:31.533
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3981
02:03:32.170 --> 02:03:33.970
<v Speaker 6>it was a really horrible thing to do.</v>

3982
02:03:34.090 --> 02:03:35.740
<v Speaker 6>Very responsible journalism.</v>

3983
02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:39.010
<v Speaker 6>And I'm a very big supporter of free speech and I thank him as well.</v>

3984
02:03:39.010 --> 02:03:42.460
<v Speaker 6>But if Newsweek does responsible about that kind of thing,</v>

3985
02:03:42.490 --> 02:03:42.790
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3986
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:45.220
<v Speaker 6>If News Week does crappy journalism,</v>

3987
02:03:45.221 --> 02:03:46.600
<v Speaker 6>they have every right to do that.</v>

3988
02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:51.020
<v Speaker 6>And we have every right to call it crappy journalism's not crappy journals.</v>

3989
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:52.240
<v Speaker 6>I'm that guy deserves a sue.</v>

3990
02:03:52.241 --> 02:03:54.400
<v Speaker 6>The fucking shit out of them will work.</v>

3991
02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:55.331
<v Speaker 6>Not Work.</v>

3992
02:03:55.331 --> 02:03:56.230
<v Speaker 6>Not In this country,</v>

3993
02:03:56.231 --> 02:03:57.190
<v Speaker 6>not in California.</v>

3994
02:03:57.191 --> 02:03:58.024
<v Speaker 6>You why not?</v>

3995
02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.970
<v Speaker 6>First Amendment is very powerful,</v>

3996
02:04:00.971 --> 02:04:03.340
<v Speaker 6>but there's you out at a guy.</v>

3997
02:04:03.341 --> 02:04:05.860
<v Speaker 6>He gave his home address out and you were wrong.</v>

3998
02:04:06.070 --> 02:04:08.350
<v Speaker 6>I feel like for sure he should be able to sue.</v>

3999
02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:09.340
<v Speaker 6>You don't think he would.</v>

4000
02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:13.030
<v Speaker 6>I think it won't be effective is especially because the California has the anti</v>

4001
02:04:13.031 --> 02:04:18.031
<v Speaker 6>slap statutes against strategic lawsuits for against public participation.</v>

4002
02:04:18.570 --> 02:04:21.330
<v Speaker 6>It's really strong protections for the first amendment,</v>

4003
02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:22.810
<v Speaker 6>especially with journalistic organization.</v>

4004
02:04:22.811 --> 02:04:23.770
<v Speaker 6>You have to show malice.</v>

4005
02:04:23.771 --> 02:04:25.690
<v Speaker 6>You have to show that he's not in the public interest.</v>

4006
02:04:25.690 --> 02:04:29.500
<v Speaker 6>You have to show deliberate harm and he has to show damages.</v>

4007
02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:30.580
<v Speaker 6>It wouldn't work.</v>

4008
02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:31.360
<v Speaker 6>Here's the point.</v>

4009
02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:32.440
<v Speaker 6>Here's the important point.</v>

4010
02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:34.690
<v Speaker 6>What did the Bitcoin community do with that?</v>

4011
02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:36.610
<v Speaker 6>They immediately said,</v>

4012
02:04:36.611 --> 02:04:39.090
<v Speaker 6>how can we help this man?</v>

4013
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:39.901
<v Speaker 6>People said,</v>

4014
02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 6>let's buy a model trains.</v>

4015
02:04:41.041 --> 02:04:42.330
<v Speaker 6>He really likes model trains.</v>

4016
02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:43.470
<v Speaker 6>Let's send them cash.</v>

4017
02:04:43.650 --> 02:04:44.610
<v Speaker 6>And some people started saying,</v>

4018
02:04:44.611 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 6>let's do a fundraiser.</v>

4019
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:46.320
<v Speaker 6>Let's do a fundraiser.</v>

4020
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:47.250
<v Speaker 6>Let's do a fundraiser.</v>

4021
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:49.740
<v Speaker 6>But who's going to do the fundraiser needs?</v>

4022
02:04:49.741 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 6>Someone trusted in the community.</v>

4023
02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.500
<v Speaker 6>And I looked at this and I thought,</v>

4024
02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:53.790
<v Speaker 6>I really don't want to get involved,</v>

4025
02:04:53.791 --> 02:04:56.220
<v Speaker 6>but this guy really deserves a break.</v>

4026
02:04:56.250 --> 02:04:57.540
<v Speaker 6>So I started a fundraiser.</v>

4027
02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:59.640
<v Speaker 6>Two days after this story broke,</v>

4028
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:03.030
<v Speaker 6>I created an address which started with one Dorian,</v>

4029
02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:04.920
<v Speaker 6>a bit coin address of Vanity address.</v>

4030
02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:05.491
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

4031
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:06.900
<v Speaker 6>let's do a fundraiser for Dorian.</v>

4032
02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:08.310
<v Speaker 6>And it's six hours.</v>

4033
02:05:08.311 --> 02:05:13.311
<v Speaker 6>That morning we raised 30 bitcoin and seen thousand dollars and over and over a</v>

4034
02:05:14.881 --> 02:05:19.110
<v Speaker 6>period of one month we raised a 50 bitcoin 47.</v>

4035
02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:20.910
<v Speaker 6>Some are for Dorian.</v>

4036
02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.260
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4037
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:23.280
<v Speaker 6>that's incredible.</v>

4038
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:28.670
<v Speaker 6>He could have now and it really started pouring in like exactly what you saw</v>

4039
02:05:28.891 --> 02:05:29.990
<v Speaker 6>just now on air.</v>

4040
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:30.511
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

4041
02:05:30.511 --> 02:05:31.344
<v Speaker 6>What's the address?</v>

4042
02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:32.521
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

4043
02:05:32.521 --> 02:05:32.791
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4044
02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:33.240
<v Speaker 6>let's uh,</v>

4045
02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:34.280
<v Speaker 6>let's post it on air.</v>

4046
02:05:34.290 --> 02:05:34.560
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

4047
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.270
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure he would like some more.</v>

4048
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:37.223
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4049
02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:39.000
<v Speaker 6>as I got the video pulled up,</v>

4050
02:05:39.001 --> 02:05:41.400
<v Speaker 6>if you wanted to watch play the video,</v>

4051
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:42.210
<v Speaker 6>so let me just,</v>

4052
02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:43.950
<v Speaker 6>let me just say what we did next,</v>

4053
02:05:43.951 --> 02:05:44.700
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>

4054
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:45.533
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4055
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:48.570
<v Speaker 6>we need to make sure we got this money to the right person.</v>

4056
02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 6>And I couldn't do that because a lot of people came to me and they said,</v>

4057
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:52.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm Dorian giving the money.</v>

4058
02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:53.401
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4059
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:54.234
<v Speaker 6>you're not.</v>

4060
02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 6>Not that stupid.</v>

4061
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.110
<v Speaker 6>The only thing I knew is what he looked like.</v>

4062
02:05:58.111 --> 02:06:03.111
<v Speaker 6>So I visited him at his home yesterday and completed my part of the deal and</v>

4063
02:06:03.571 --> 02:06:05.550
<v Speaker 6>gave him the fund raiser.</v>

4064
02:06:05.551 --> 02:06:06.420
<v Speaker 6>And I haven't announced this.</v>

4065
02:06:06.421 --> 02:06:06.631
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

4066
02:06:06.631 --> 02:06:09.930
<v Speaker 6>I just did a posting with the video and he made a little video for us.</v>

4067
02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 6>So I'd like to play that video is for the bitcoin community.</v>

4068
02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:14.251
<v Speaker 6>And while you're doing that,</v>

4069

4087
02:06:58.730 --> 02:07:03.730
<v Speaker 11>And I'm not Satoshi Nakamoto as portrayed as a creator.</v>

4117
02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:08.470
<v Speaker 11>Thank you.</v>

4118
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:09.430
<v Speaker 9>That's so cool.</v>

4119
02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:11.020
<v Speaker 9>That's so cool.</v>

4120
02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:11.740
<v Speaker 9>I love,</v>

4121
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:13.060
<v Speaker 9>I love his sentiment.</v>

4122
02:09:13.061 --> 02:09:14.440
<v Speaker 9>I love what he just said.</v>

4123
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:15.130
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

4124
02:09:15.130 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 9>you could tell that's not a,</v>

4125
02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:19.510
<v Speaker 9>I wasn't a canned speech that that guy was really touched.</v>

4126
02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:19.961
<v Speaker 9>Yes,</v>

4127
02:09:19.961 --> 02:09:20.291
<v Speaker 9>it was a,</v>

4128
02:09:20.291 --> 02:09:20.860
<v Speaker 9>it was a,</v>

4129
02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.390
<v Speaker 9>he is really sweet,</v>

4130
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:26.320
<v Speaker 9>really sweet person and this wasn't fair what happened to him,</v>

4131
02:09:26.321 --> 02:09:31.321
<v Speaker 9>but the bitcoin community came through with a really great fundraiser that will</v>

4132
02:09:32.951 --> 02:09:35.080
<v Speaker 9>have a material impact on this person's life.</v>

4133
02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:36.213
<v Speaker 9>That's so cool.</v>

4134
02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:40.540
<v Speaker 9>And do ops some of the damage that was caused by irresponsible journalism.</v>

4135
02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:40.801
<v Speaker 9>And I,</v>

4136
02:09:40.801 --> 02:09:41.201
<v Speaker 9>I can tell you,</v>

4137
02:09:41.201 --> 02:09:42.280
<v Speaker 9>I mean I spend three hours with him.</v>

4138
02:09:42.281 --> 02:09:44.480
<v Speaker 9>He is not the tuition to come out of the creative bitcoin.</v>

4139
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:45.430
<v Speaker 9>No question about it.</v>

4140
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:45.640
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4141
02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:48.130
<v Speaker 9>just setting up his Internet connection was a huge struggle.</v>

4142
02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:49.810
<v Speaker 9>Is that his a bitcoin address,</v>

4143
02:09:49.811 --> 02:09:50.111
<v Speaker 9>Brian?</v>

4144
02:09:50.111 --> 02:09:50.800
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4145
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:51.190
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

4146
02:09:51.190 --> 02:09:55.210
<v Speaker 9>can you text me that so I could put it online or email me that so I to put it</v>

4147
02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:55.690
<v Speaker 9>online,</v>

4148
02:09:55.690 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 9>I female both sent it to me.</v>

4149
02:09:58.210 --> 02:09:58.890
<v Speaker 9>Nope,</v>

4150
02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:01.660
<v Speaker 9>please send it to me and I'll throw it up on Twitter right now too.</v>

4151
02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:02.913
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

4152
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:07.960
<v Speaker 9>with the story explaining to everybody who this gentleman is and what went</v>

4153
02:10:07.961 --> 02:10:08.794
<v Speaker 9>wrong,</v>

4154
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:15.360
<v Speaker 9>that's sad that they decided to go ahead and print that story with no,</v>

4155
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:18.630
<v Speaker 9>no substantiation.</v>

4156
02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.590
<v Speaker 9>They're still sticking by the story.</v>

4157
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:22.930
<v Speaker 9>They still saying we got the right person.</v>

4158
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:24.070
<v Speaker 9>How can they do that?</v>

4159
02:10:24.071 --> 02:10:24.301
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

4160
02:10:24.301 --> 02:10:27.970
<v Speaker 9>and it's so obvious to everyone who's got half a brain,</v>

4161
02:10:28.150 --> 02:10:29.110
<v Speaker 9>what does this gentleman do?</v>

4162
02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:30.731
<v Speaker 9>He's retired.</v>

4163
02:10:30.731 --> 02:10:32.260
<v Speaker 9>He used to be involved in,</v>

4164
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:32.800
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

4165
02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.633
<v Speaker 9>I don't want to,</v>

4166
02:10:33.650 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 9>I don't want</v>

4167
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.430
<v Speaker 5>to intrude in his life any,</v>

4168
02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 5>any further.</v>

4169
02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:37.700
<v Speaker 5>He just wants to be left alone.</v>

4170
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.120
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4171
02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:38.871
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

4172
02:10:38.871 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 5>he now has access to this fundraiser so he can,</v>

4173
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 5>he can use this money.</v>

4174
02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

4175
02:10:45.110 --> 02:10:45.351
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4176
02:10:45.351 --> 02:10:45.801
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>

4177
02:10:45.801 --> 02:10:45.981
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4178
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:49.070
<v Speaker 5>they basically intruded into his life and violated his privacy and most</v>

4179
02:10:49.071 --> 02:10:52.040
<v Speaker 5>importantly handled his personal information irresponsibly.</v>

4180
02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4181
02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:54.890
<v Speaker 5>but in the end,</v>

4182
02:10:54.891 --> 02:10:58.640
<v Speaker 5>the bitcoin community came through with generosity and grace and charity.</v>

4183
02:10:58.680 --> 02:10:59.570
<v Speaker 5>And that's the,</v>

4184
02:10:59.630 --> 02:11:01.950
<v Speaker 5>that's really the big thing about bitcoin is,</v>

4185
02:11:01.951 --> 02:11:04.010
<v Speaker 5>is so much charity going on in this space.</v>

4186
02:11:04.270 --> 02:11:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's beautiful.</v>

4187
02:11:05.321 --> 02:11:07.840
<v Speaker 2>And it is cool at the bid corn community came through.</v>

4188
02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.960
<v Speaker 2>But what drives me crazy is that this long established journalism outlet would</v>

4189
02:11:15.551 --> 02:11:17.620
<v Speaker 2>be so irresponsible.</v>

4190
02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Not that long established.</v>

4191
02:11:19.091 --> 02:11:24.091
<v Speaker 5>This is being purchased is the name has been purchased by new management,</v>

4192
02:11:24.161 --> 02:11:26.560
<v Speaker 5>has nothing to do with the previous management.</v>

4193
02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:27.191
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4194
02:11:27.191 --> 02:11:27.731
<v Speaker 5>Newsweek,</v>

4195
02:11:27.731 --> 02:11:28.121
<v Speaker 5>raw.</v>

4196
02:11:28.121 --> 02:11:29.950
<v Speaker 5>This is completely new.</v>

4197
02:11:29.951 --> 02:11:31.960
<v Speaker 5>People running under the same brand.</v>

4198
02:11:32.290 --> 02:11:37.210
<v Speaker 5>When did this and now you know exactly what kind of quality journalism they put</v>

4199
02:11:37.211 --> 02:11:37.630
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

4200
02:11:37.630 --> 02:11:39.820
<v Speaker 5>which is yellow trash.</v>

4201
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:41.240
<v Speaker 2>So they're just trying to make money.</v>

4202
02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:45.170
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to sell magazines at whatever cost.</v>

4203
02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they knew that this guy,</v>

4204
02:11:46.671 --> 02:11:49.190
<v Speaker 2>do you think they are sticking by the story because he can't prove it?</v>

4205
02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're just trying to not be responsible for their actions or not</v>

4206
02:11:54.261 --> 02:11:58.360
<v Speaker 2>be financially responsible for any damages that</v>

4207
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:59.320
<v Speaker 5>he might've suffered?</v>

4208
02:11:59.830 --> 02:12:01.600
<v Speaker 5>They make money the way they make money,</v>

4209
02:12:01.601 --> 02:12:02.590
<v Speaker 5>they make click see the way,</v>

4210
02:12:02.591 --> 02:12:04.470
<v Speaker 5>the more controversy around it,</v>

4211
02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:06.570
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really matter at this point.</v>

4212
02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:07.860
<v Speaker 2>That's very disappointing.</v>

4213
02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:09.090
<v Speaker 2>So this is a new thing.</v>

4214
02:12:09.091 --> 02:12:10.290
<v Speaker 2>People that have bought Newsweek,</v>

4215
02:12:10.291 --> 02:12:11.160
<v Speaker 2>this is fairly new.</v>

4216
02:12:11.730 --> 02:12:11.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4217
02:12:11.881 --> 02:12:14.940
<v Speaker 5>This came out on the 14th of March.</v>

4218
02:12:14.970 --> 02:12:15.431
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

4219
02:12:15.431 --> 02:12:16.650
<v Speaker 5>the purchase of Newsweek.</v>

4220
02:12:17.190 --> 02:12:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4221
02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:18.300
<v Speaker 5>This is their,</v>

4222
02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:19.740
<v Speaker 5>this is their launch edition.</v>

4223
02:12:20.730 --> 02:12:22.020
<v Speaker 5>This is what they launched with.</v>

4224
02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:24.270
<v Speaker 5>This is what they launched with.</v>

4225
02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:25.220
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

4226
02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:28.630
<v Speaker 5>you can't go backwards on your first issue of a nuance because that would make</v>

4227
02:12:28.631 --> 02:12:28.720
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4228
02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:29.130
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

4229
02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:29.551
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

4230
02:12:29.551 --> 02:12:30.031
<v Speaker 5>we suck.</v>

4231
02:12:30.031 --> 02:12:30.864
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

4232
02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:34.320
<v Speaker 5>Their first edition was an absolute stinker.</v>

4233
02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:34.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4234
02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:34.831
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

4235
02:12:34.831 --> 02:12:35.920
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of Dick bags.</v>

4236
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:38.203
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

4237
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.351
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>

4238
02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll never buy a Newsweek.</v>

4239
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:41.114
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>

4240
02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Not you can't do that.</v>

4241
02:12:43.370 --> 02:12:43.791
<v Speaker 2>Can't do.</v>

4242
02:12:43.791 --> 02:12:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't push a guy's fucking home address out there.</v>

4243
02:12:46.401 --> 02:12:51.260
<v Speaker 2>And pictures of them will answer dory and Yakamoto when his lawyers writes us</v>

4244
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:53.173
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

4245
02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:54.013
<v Speaker 5>I like that guy.</v>

4246
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

4247
02:12:56.490 --> 02:12:57.390
<v Speaker 2>You gotta know,</v>

4248
02:12:57.391 --> 02:12:57.781
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4249
02:12:57.781 --> 02:13:00.510
<v Speaker 2>You've got to really be sure you can't just accuse a guy,</v>

4250
02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:04.470
<v Speaker 2>especially in the midst of all this chaos with the Mt Gox collapse</v>

4251
02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:10.180
<v Speaker 5>and the very real physical danger that is implied by first saying that someone</v>

4252
02:13:11.181 --> 02:13:11.931
<v Speaker 5>has a lot of money,</v>

4253
02:13:11.931 --> 02:13:12.764
<v Speaker 5>which he doesn't.</v>

4254
02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:14.080
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4255
02:13:14.090 --> 02:13:17.470
<v Speaker 5>inviting all of the crazies to visit his address by publishing it</v>

4256
02:13:18.810 --> 02:13:19.920
<v Speaker 2>insane amounts of money,</v>

4257
02:13:19.921 --> 02:13:20.221
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4258
02:13:20.221 --> 02:13:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Like $9 million or something,</v>

4259
02:13:22.041 --> 02:13:23.460
<v Speaker 2>something fucking crazy like that.</v>

4260
02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Not even need billion dollars.</v>

4261
02:13:24.841 --> 02:13:25.674
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

4262
02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:26.920
<v Speaker 5>The real subtle,</v>

4263
02:13:26.921 --> 02:13:31.921
<v Speaker 5>she could be a controlling up to $500 million in bitcoin a current price.</v>

4264
02:13:32.751 --> 02:13:33.660
<v Speaker 5>So you can hold it.</v>

4265
02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:37.080
<v Speaker 5>You mean he might have that much a million pick one?</v>

4266
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.790
<v Speaker 5>He might have himself.</v>

4267
02:13:38.791 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 5>He might have a million bitcoin.</v>

4268
02:13:40.050 --> 02:13:40.883
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4269
02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:41.851
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4270
02:13:41.851 --> 02:13:44.460
<v Speaker 5>that's the estimate that Satoshi Nakamoto has a million bitcoin.</v>

4271
02:13:44.490 --> 02:13:44.761
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4272
02:13:44.761 --> 02:13:45.810
<v Speaker 5>But is he real?</v>

4273
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Is there a Satoshi Nakamoto?</v>

4274
02:13:47.610 --> 02:13:48.480
<v Speaker 5>Is there a guy,</v>

4275
02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:49.110
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

4276
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:50.220
<v Speaker 5>let's call Mr x.</v>

4277
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.720
<v Speaker 5>There is a real Mr x.</v>

4278
02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:52.021
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4279
02:13:52.021 --> 02:13:52.261
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4280
02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:53.430
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to think that,</v>

4281
02:13:53.431 --> 02:13:54.264
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4282
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.680
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4283
02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:56.760
<v Speaker 5>well she is real.</v>

4284
02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.890
<v Speaker 5>She okay.</v>

4285
02:13:59.000 --> 02:13:59.833
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4286
02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

4287
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:00.841
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

4288
02:14:00.841 --> 02:14:01.674
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

4289
02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:03.090
<v Speaker 5>She has a Ba.</v>

4290
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:05.820
<v Speaker 5>I usually say she's have to one of the conferences.</v>

4291
02:14:05.821 --> 02:14:07.470
<v Speaker 5>So make sure you treat all the ladies right.</v>

4292
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:08.970
<v Speaker 5>Because one of them might be Sitoshi.</v>

4293
02:14:08.971 --> 02:14:09.804
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine?</v>

4294
02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:10.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4295
02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:13.590
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if Satoshi was just a really smart who's growing?</v>

4296
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:15.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

4297
02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:15.331
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4298
02:14:15.331 --> 02:14:15.511
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4299
02:14:15.511 --> 02:14:15.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4300
02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:17.370
<v Speaker 5>you can say it's a pseudonym,</v>

4301
02:14:17.371 --> 02:14:18.061
<v Speaker 5>so it could be male,</v>

4302
02:14:18.061 --> 02:14:18.391
<v Speaker 5>female,</v>

4303
02:14:18.391 --> 02:14:18.811
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter.</v>

4304
02:14:18.811 --> 02:14:20.160
<v Speaker 5>It could be several folks.</v>

4305
02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:20.700
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4306
02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:25.530
<v Speaker 5>And I think the most likely explanation is that it was a group of researchers,</v>

4307
02:14:25.531 --> 02:14:26.430
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter.</v>

4308
02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:27.770
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what it is.</v>

4309
02:14:27.771 --> 02:14:28.700
<v Speaker 1>That group of researchers,</v>

4310
02:14:28.701 --> 02:14:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that group of researchers is in control of $500 million worth of Bitcoin,</v>

4311
02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 5>potentially potentially in control because we don't know what's happened with</v>

4312
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:36.631
<v Speaker 5>the keys.</v>

4313
02:14:36.631 --> 02:14:38.250
<v Speaker 5>None of it has been moved.</v>

4314
02:14:38.490 --> 02:14:39.990
<v Speaker 5>None of it has been touched.</v>

4315
02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:42.330
<v Speaker 5>So it's just sitting there.</v>

4316
02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:44.163
<v Speaker 5>It's just sitting there.</v>

4317
02:14:44.730 --> 02:14:45.360
<v Speaker 5>We'll test it.</v>

4318
02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:47.330
<v Speaker 5>We'll be the first car that you could buy with bitcoin.</v>

4319
02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:49.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4320
02:14:49.130 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 5>He probably can already.</v>

4321
02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:51.001
<v Speaker 5>I think they,</v>

4322
02:14:51.001 --> 02:14:53.870
<v Speaker 5>there's some dealers are selling a bunch of cars for bitcoin.</v>

4323
02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:56.430
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be surprised that they're selling cars for bitcoin.</v>

4324
02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:58.820
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of lumbar kidneys have been sold for bitcoin already.</v>

4325
02:14:59.790 --> 02:15:04.790
<v Speaker 5>People are buying apartments and property and planes and then of course in trade</v>

4326
02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:07.321
<v Speaker 5>it in for money.</v>

4327
02:15:07.321 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 5>So you can pretty much buy anything with bitcoins with an exchange.</v>

4328
02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.000
<v Speaker 5>And Virgin Galactic,</v>

4329
02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:12.721
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4330
02:15:12.721 --> 02:15:13.500
<v Speaker 5>cells,</v>

4331
02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:13.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4332
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:18.830
<v Speaker 5>seats on their flights to space of a bitcoin and they've sold seven already.</v>

4333
02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:21.001
<v Speaker 5>All it's happening.</v>

4334
02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:23.220
<v Speaker 5>People are going to space with bitcoin</v>

4335
02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:25.070
<v Speaker 1>allegedly going to space.</v>

4336
02:15:25.071 --> 02:15:27.470
<v Speaker 1>They might just get launched on the end of a bomb.</v>

4337
02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:32.440
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker's going to have to fly for a long time before daddy goes to</v>

4338
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:33.303
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

4339
02:15:34.130 --> 02:15:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm so not interested in being an early adopter of the fucking spaceship.</v>

4340
02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really space either coins and Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

4341
02:15:41.601 --> 02:15:42.720
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it's kind of do it.</v>

4342
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4343
02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:47.870
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it's kind of a goof to spend $100,000 to go like a little higher than</v>

4344
02:15:47.871 --> 02:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>a plane and look down and then dropped back down again.</v>

4345
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:51.740
<v Speaker 5>Well you do go into zero G.</v>

4346
02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:52.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4347
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:57.550
<v Speaker 5>and so I think it's interesting because it's that reusable reentry capability,</v>

4348
02:15:57.981 --> 02:16:02.380
<v Speaker 5>which is revolutionary in the way they've done it is very visionary approach</v>

4349
02:16:02.410 --> 02:16:03.180
<v Speaker 5>real time.</v>

4350
02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:03.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4351
02:16:03.481 --> 02:16:04.201
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

4352
02:16:04.201 --> 02:16:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson's a bad mother fucker.</v>

4353
02:16:05.850 --> 02:16:06.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4354
02:16:06.211 --> 02:16:07.200
<v Speaker 1>a no argument there.</v>

4355
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I just think until you can go to the moon,</v>

4356
02:16:10.110 --> 02:16:11.190
<v Speaker 1>you can go fuck yourself.</v>

4357
02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:12.451
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

4358
02:16:12.451 --> 02:16:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Or until you can go zoom around a few con,</v>

4359
02:16:15.210 --> 02:16:15.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4360
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:17.310
<v Speaker 1>hang out there for a day,</v>

4361
02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:18.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4362
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.750
<v Speaker 1>sit a luxury suite on a top of the earth and look down.</v>

4363
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:24.420
<v Speaker 1>You can only go there for like a minute and then you got to come flying back</v>

4364
02:16:24.421 --> 02:16:24.811
<v Speaker 1>down again.</v>

4365
02:16:24.811 --> 02:16:25.021
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4366
02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the idea behind that?</v>

4367
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:27.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4368
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.661
<v Speaker 5>I would agree.</v>

4369
02:16:27.661 --> 02:16:29.040
<v Speaker 5>The ultimate goal is to the,</v>

4370
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:29.951
<v Speaker 5>to the moon.</v>

4371
02:16:29.951 --> 02:16:30.784
<v Speaker 5>Alice</v>

4372
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:31.490
<v Speaker 9>having nice,</v>

4373
02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:32.470
<v Speaker 9>I like hotel.</v>

4374
02:16:32.471 --> 02:16:32.891
<v Speaker 9>They're like,</v>

4375
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:35.890
<v Speaker 9>I didn't like a really nice hotel that you can stay out for a weekend.</v>

4376
02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:37.271
<v Speaker 9>Some Moon,</v>

4377
02:16:37.271 --> 02:16:38.020
<v Speaker 9>hotel,</v>

4378
02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 9>g zero g swimming pools,</v>

4379
02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:41.230
<v Speaker 9>zero g sex.</v>

4380
02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:42.420
<v Speaker 9>How about that?</v>

4381
02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:43.180
<v Speaker 9>Coming here?</v>

4382
02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 9>Facials,</v>

4383
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:46.540
<v Speaker 9>zero g squirt.</v>

4384
02:16:46.541 --> 02:16:48.670
<v Speaker 9>She's ducks like she's no matrix.</v>

4385
02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:52.493
<v Speaker 9>You would have a,</v>

4386
02:16:52.810 --> 02:16:53.081
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

4387
02:16:53.081 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 9>I guess it would still propel.</v>

4388
02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:57.220
<v Speaker 9>It would probably go on for ever and if you could stick your dick outside of the</v>

4389
02:16:57.221 --> 02:16:58.240
<v Speaker 9>spaceship and just shoot,</v>

4390
02:16:58.241 --> 02:16:59.074
<v Speaker 9>went into space,</v>

4391
02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.120
<v Speaker 9>it would just take off forever,</v>

4392
02:17:01.430 --> 02:17:02.830
<v Speaker 9>but it'd be frozen instantly.</v>

4393
02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 9>Girls on a rag and being on your bed.</v>

4394
02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:07.320
<v Speaker 9>It's floating around in your whole entire room.</v>

4395
02:17:07.350 --> 02:17:09.530
<v Speaker 9>You're not going to discuss what if she squirts?</v>

4396
02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:10.473
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

4397
02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:11.343
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

4398
02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:11.801
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

4399
02:17:11.801 --> 02:17:12.720
<v Speaker 9>You don't want to upset.</v>

4400
02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:16.690
<v Speaker 9>This is the Joe Rogan experience podcast.</v>

4401
02:17:16.691 --> 02:17:17.860
<v Speaker 9>That's how we do things over here.</v>

4402
02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:18.993
<v Speaker 9>I'm sorry.</v>

4403
02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:19.720
<v Speaker 9>I mean a,</v>

4404
02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:21.090
<v Speaker 9>we're going to help you promote bitcoin,</v>

4405
02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:22.330
<v Speaker 9>but we're not going to change the format.</v>

4406
02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:22.950
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

4407
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:23.231
<v Speaker 9>no.</v>

4408
02:17:23.231 --> 02:17:24.130
<v Speaker 9>I love loving it.</v>

4409
02:17:24.131 --> 02:17:24.964
<v Speaker 9>No worries.</v>

4410
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:27.310
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

4411
02:17:27.310 --> 02:17:29.350
<v Speaker 9>so Lamborghini doesn't take it.</v>

4412
02:17:29.351 --> 02:17:30.390
<v Speaker 9>It's like a third party thing.</v>

4413
02:17:30.391 --> 02:17:31.224
<v Speaker 9>Is that how you close?</v>

4414
02:17:31.230 --> 02:17:36.230
<v Speaker 9>Who are selling you ships that are taking that crazy accepting bitcoin?</v>

4415
02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:36.490
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

4416
02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:36.880
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

4417
02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:37.930
<v Speaker 9>How crazy is the risk?</v>

4418
02:17:37.931 --> 02:17:38.250
<v Speaker 9>Listen,</v>

4419
02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:41.450
<v Speaker 9>you'd get a lot of a lot of publicity and marketing and then you take the big</v>

4420
02:17:41.451 --> 02:17:44.320
<v Speaker 9>coin and you convert it the same day to us dollar.</v>

4421
02:17:44.321 --> 02:17:46.300
<v Speaker 9>So you don't get any exchange rate risk.</v>

4422
02:17:46.301 --> 02:17:47.740
<v Speaker 9>And what's the difference?</v>

4423
02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:48.670
<v Speaker 9>Nothing.</v>

4424
02:17:48.670 --> 02:17:49.390
<v Speaker 9>Good point.</v>

4425
02:17:49.390 --> 02:17:50.320
<v Speaker 9>It's a very good point.</v>

4426
02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.030
<v Speaker 9>A lot of merchants are doing,</v>

4427
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:53.650
<v Speaker 9>I kind of see it,</v>

4428
02:17:53.651 --> 02:17:54.251
<v Speaker 9>but man,</v>

4429
02:17:54.251 --> 02:17:54.511
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>

4430
02:17:54.511 --> 02:17:55.240
<v Speaker 9>you would,</v>

4431
02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:56.680
<v Speaker 9>I would put a tap on it.</v>

4432
02:17:56.890 --> 02:17:57.161
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

4433
02:17:57.161 --> 02:17:58.420
<v Speaker 9>if it was my dealership,</v>

4434
02:17:58.421 --> 02:18:01.190
<v Speaker 9>I'd say we're allowed to sell one a month with bitcoin.</v>

4435
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:05.800
<v Speaker 9>Everything else has to be with good old American dollars back by blood and</v>

4436
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:06.634
<v Speaker 9>eagles</v>

4437
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:10.323
<v Speaker 9>fucking,</v>

4438
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:12.340
<v Speaker 9>you can't just bank the whole thing on these,</v>

4439
02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:14.000
<v Speaker 9>these weird digital currencies.</v>

4440
02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:15.310
<v Speaker 9>I bet.</v>

4441
02:18:15.310 --> 02:18:18.430
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to be sending Justin wren 1000 bucks by the end of this day.</v>

4442
02:18:18.610 --> 02:18:18.840
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

4443
02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:20.260
<v Speaker 9>I might be a lot more than that.</v>

4444
02:18:20.650 --> 02:18:21.071
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

4445
02:18:21.071 --> 02:18:22.180
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to have to decipher it.</v>

4446
02:18:22.181 --> 02:18:23.014
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to need your help.</v>

4447
02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

4448
02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.270
<v Speaker 9>After this podcast is over,</v>

4449
02:18:25.271 --> 02:18:27.650
<v Speaker 9>we're going to have to go over how much I need to write a check for.</v>

4450
02:18:28.390 --> 02:18:28.630
<v Speaker 9>What?</v>

4451
02:18:28.630 --> 02:18:30.310
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to leave the money in there though.</v>

4452
02:18:30.311 --> 02:18:31.570
<v Speaker 9>So if you keep sending it to him,</v>

4453
02:18:31.571 --> 02:18:31.991
<v Speaker 9>he'll kill,</v>

4454
02:18:31.991 --> 02:18:32.824
<v Speaker 9>keep getting money.</v>

4455
02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:34.323
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

4456
02:18:34.510 --> 02:18:38.530
<v Speaker 9>what else has happened in the last two and a half months besides these?</v>

4457
02:18:38.531 --> 02:18:41.290
<v Speaker 9>A really fantastic innovations that,</v>

4458
02:18:41.291 --> 02:18:41.800
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

4459
02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:42.910
<v Speaker 9>that you're excited about?</v>

4460
02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:43.961
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

4461
02:18:43.961 --> 02:18:44.200
<v Speaker 9>there's,</v>

4462
02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:45.880
<v Speaker 9>there's the whole environment,</v>

4463
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:48.280
<v Speaker 9>which is weird in terms of media,</v>

4464
02:18:48.281 --> 02:18:49.061
<v Speaker 9>on regulation.</v>

4465
02:18:49.061 --> 02:18:50.440
<v Speaker 9>It's been good news,</v>

4466
02:18:50.441 --> 02:18:50.831
<v Speaker 9>bad news,</v>

4467
02:18:50.831 --> 02:18:51.191
<v Speaker 9>good news,</v>

4468
02:18:51.191 --> 02:18:52.024
<v Speaker 9>bad news,</v>

4469
02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:53.160
<v Speaker 9>trying to stay.</v>

4470
02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:54.940
<v Speaker 9>You were talking about China's spending it,</v>

4471
02:18:54.941 --> 02:18:55.541
<v Speaker 9>not bending it.</v>

4472
02:18:55.541 --> 02:18:57.160
<v Speaker 9>Russia's banning it and not battling it.</v>

4473
02:18:57.161 --> 02:18:58.900
<v Speaker 9>Vietnam spending it and not panning it.</v>

4474
02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:03.070
<v Speaker 9>And this is really funny because of course the countries in which these iron</v>

4475
02:19:03.071 --> 02:19:06.940
<v Speaker 9>fist bands are happening at the countries where the rule of law is least</v>

4476
02:19:06.941 --> 02:19:07.774
<v Speaker 9>respected.</v>

4477
02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:09.281
<v Speaker 9>So true.</v>

4478
02:19:09.281 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 9>Right,</v>

4479
02:19:09.610 --> 02:19:09.881
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

4480
02:19:09.881 --> 02:19:11.350
<v Speaker 9>So it's like boots and bandits.</v>

4481
02:19:11.351 --> 02:19:11.740
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

4482
02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:12.573
<v Speaker 9>you know what?</v>

4483
02:19:12.730 --> 02:19:15.010
<v Speaker 9>Hard dollars were bands in the 80s,</v>

4484
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.903
<v Speaker 9>in,</v>

4485
02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:16.901
<v Speaker 9>in Russia.</v>

4486
02:19:16.901 --> 02:19:17.520
<v Speaker 9>You couldn't,</v>

4487
02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.660
<v Speaker 9>you were not allowed to have foreign currency,</v>

4488
02:19:19.661 --> 02:19:21.430
<v Speaker 9>hard currency throughout the Soviet Union.</v>

4489
02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:22.570
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

4490
02:19:22.570 --> 02:19:23.950
<v Speaker 9>it was banned from very,</v>

4491
02:19:23.951 --> 02:19:25.270
<v Speaker 9>very seriously band,</v>

4492
02:19:25.450 --> 02:19:25.721
<v Speaker 9>I guess,</v>

4493
02:19:25.721 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 9>who started stuffing their suitcases with hard dollars</v>

4494
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:28.581
<v Speaker 6>first,</v>

4495
02:19:28.581 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 6>the politburo.</v>

4496
02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:29.721
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4497
02:19:29.721 --> 02:19:30.080
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>

4498
02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:34.360
<v Speaker 6>And then the army generals and then the cops and then all of the people who are</v>

4499
02:19:34.361 --> 02:19:35.870
<v Speaker 6>in those countries are above the law.</v>

4500
02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.320
<v Speaker 6>And then the people who were below the law then bribes that people who are above</v>

4501
02:19:39.321 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 6>the law in dollars of course,</v>

4502
02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:41.960
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4503
02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:45.050
<v Speaker 6>to also hold dollars and the whole thing becomes a mockery.</v>

4504
02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Puente is like a gigantic Russian version of John Gotti.</v>

4505
02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4506
02:19:50.130 --> 02:19:51.330
<v Speaker 1>he really is like,</v>

4507
02:19:51.331 --> 02:19:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you remember how God,</v>

4508
02:19:52.181 --> 02:19:56.070
<v Speaker 1>he was like so flamboyant about the fact that he was the head of the mob.</v>

4509
02:19:56.370 --> 02:19:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Like there was the heads of the mom before God.</v>

4510
02:19:58.701 --> 02:20:00.180
<v Speaker 1>He were like real secretive.</v>

4511
02:20:00.181 --> 02:20:02.160
<v Speaker 1>There was that Guy Vincent the chin,</v>

4512
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:03.990
<v Speaker 1>good Janti or however you say his name,</v>

4513
02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.060
<v Speaker 1>who would walk around the neighborhood pretending to be crazy.</v>

4514
02:20:06.061 --> 02:20:08.570
<v Speaker 1>He would wear a bathrobe and slippers and you,</v>

4515
02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:11.640
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't even like say his name because they,</v>

4516
02:20:11.641 --> 02:20:14.850
<v Speaker 1>he told everybody that everything was being tapped all the time.</v>

4517
02:20:14.970 --> 02:20:17.310
<v Speaker 1>So don't ever say my name when you're talking about me.</v>

4518
02:20:17.370 --> 02:20:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Point point to your chin.</v>

4519
02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So people would just like go and you know,</v>

4520
02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:22.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to take that he's going to,</v>

4521
02:20:22.861 --> 02:20:23.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4522
02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it's going to want to do something for our friends.</v>

4523
02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:27.260
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

4524
02:20:27.390 --> 02:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a good idea.</v>

4525
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:30.690
<v Speaker 1>They had pointed a Chin because his name is Vincent the chin,</v>

4526
02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:32.970
<v Speaker 1>good Janti or gigante or whatever the hell it was.</v>

4527
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:34.170
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

4528
02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:34.911
<v Speaker 1>but then God,</v>

4529
02:20:34.911 --> 02:20:39.570
<v Speaker 1>he came along and just wearing fucking $10,000 suits and you know,</v>

4530
02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:44.150
<v Speaker 1>it was an obvious mobster and had obvious mobsters with a,</v>

4531
02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:47.790
<v Speaker 1>when there was public kits and all this crazy shit and everybody loved him</v>

4532
02:20:47.791 --> 02:20:49.080
<v Speaker 1>because he was the face of the mob.</v>

4533
02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:52.080
<v Speaker 1>This Putin guy is sort of like that in a way.</v>

4534
02:20:52.081 --> 02:20:55.590
<v Speaker 1>But on I'll crazier scale because he's running a whole country.</v>

4535
02:20:55.890 --> 02:20:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's essentially just grabbed the whole country</v>

4536
02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:01.430
<v Speaker 6>and not just that,</v>

4537
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:03.020
<v Speaker 6>here's the little secret.</v>

4538
02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:08.021
<v Speaker 6>I think that the thing that most people miss is the elephant in the room.</v>

4539
02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:09.830
<v Speaker 6>And that's Gazprom.</v>

4540
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.350
<v Speaker 6>That's what natural gas,</v>

4541
02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:13.700
<v Speaker 6>natural gas Gazprom.</v>

4542
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:16.910
<v Speaker 6>So basically they've nationalized the gas industry.</v>

4543
02:21:16.911 --> 02:21:20.450
<v Speaker 6>The gas industry then supplies a natural gas,</v>

4544
02:21:20.451 --> 02:21:21.284
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>

4545
02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:21.830
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4546
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:26.510
<v Speaker 6>one of the ways that we've avoided the impact of peak oil and energy</v>

4547
02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:30.360
<v Speaker 6>constriction that is killing worldwide economies right now because oil's gotten</v>

4548
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:31.580
<v Speaker 6>vastly expensive,</v>

4549
02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:34.460
<v Speaker 6>but cast Scott cheaper because of fracking and other things.</v>

4550
02:21:34.461 --> 02:21:36.680
<v Speaker 6>And Gazprom produces most of the gas in the world.</v>

4551
02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:41.390
<v Speaker 6>So much so that they supply all of Europe with natural gas and they supply them</v>

4552
02:21:41.391 --> 02:21:46.010
<v Speaker 6>through pipelines that go through which country Africanize the Ukraine and</v>

4553
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan and various other places.</v>

4554
02:21:47.961 --> 02:21:52.961
<v Speaker 6>But the line of pipelines of gas are the hot spots of war and civil war and the</v>

4555
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 6>occupation all across eastern Europe.</v>

4556
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:03.260
<v Speaker 6>And right now there's this huge power play going on,</v>

4557
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:04.040
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4558
02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:05.180
<v Speaker 6>around the Ukraine.</v>

4559
02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:10.280
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of that has to do with a routes of gas.</v>

4560
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.941
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

4561
02:22:10.941 --> 02:22:15.941
<v Speaker 6>and it's a massive geopolitical power play between a world powers.</v>

4562
02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:19.820
<v Speaker 6>And Putin can basically say,</v>

4563
02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:23.180
<v Speaker 6>we just doubled the price of gas in the Ukraine,</v>

4564
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:24.170
<v Speaker 6>which is exactly what they did.</v>

4565
02:22:24.171 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 6>I think they quadrupled in fact,</v>

4566
02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:29.010
<v Speaker 6>which plunged the country into a recession.</v>

4567
02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:30.240
<v Speaker 6>And then they said to Europe,</v>

4568
02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:30.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4569
02:22:30.451 --> 02:22:31.950
<v Speaker 6>you don't threaten us with sanctions,</v>

4570
02:22:31.951 --> 02:22:33.210
<v Speaker 6>we're going to turn off your gas.</v>

4571
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:34.140
<v Speaker 6>And if you do,</v>

4572
02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:37.740
<v Speaker 6>all of you are going into recession because that's the only form of cheap energy</v>

4573
02:22:37.741 --> 02:22:38.574
<v Speaker 6>you have.</v>

4574
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.121
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4575
02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:40.530
<v Speaker 6>we got to go into world war three</v>

4576
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>is that it seems like some weird shit is happening.</v>

4577
02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Japan is upping its military now.</v>

4578
02:22:45.971 --> 02:22:48.160
<v Speaker 2>It's navy is getting larger and larger by the day.</v>

4579
02:22:48.490 --> 02:22:49.090
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4580
02:22:49.090 --> 02:22:49.510
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

4581
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:52.870
<v Speaker 2>they're changing their whole policies as far as how they deal with other</v>

4582
02:22:52.871 --> 02:22:57.250
<v Speaker 2>countries because China is encroaching on a lot of these islands that Japan has</v>

4583
02:22:57.251 --> 02:22:58.150
<v Speaker 2>been controlling.</v>

4584
02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:03.720
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me like more and more every day the powers are moving into</v>

4585
02:23:03.851 --> 02:23:06.730
<v Speaker 2>position to dominate portions of the world.</v>

4586
02:23:06.731 --> 02:23:07.564
<v Speaker 2>And it just seems,</v>

4587
02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:09.730
<v Speaker 2>it seems like some shit is about to happen.</v>

4588
02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:15.190
<v Speaker 6>The era of cheap energy is over and the world has to reshuffle to accept that</v>

4589
02:23:15.191 --> 02:23:16.024
<v Speaker 6>fact.</v>

4590
02:23:16.390 --> 02:23:16.930
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4591
02:23:16.930 --> 02:23:19.600
<v Speaker 6>cheap peak oil changes everything.</v>

4592
02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:21.220
<v Speaker 6>You can't sustain the same,</v>

4593
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:22.061
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4594
02:23:22.061 --> 02:23:27.061
<v Speaker 6>consumerists behavior in developed countries and that together with climate</v>

4595
02:23:27.311 --> 02:23:28.060
<v Speaker 6>change,</v>

4596
02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:28.451
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

4597
02:23:28.451 --> 02:23:29.440
<v Speaker 6>it's a combination.</v>

4598
02:23:29.441 --> 02:23:33.940
<v Speaker 6>The creates upheaval all around the world and at the same time you have the</v>

4599
02:23:33.941 --> 02:23:38.941
<v Speaker 6>world's worst currency crisis in three generations and we are currently living</v>

4600
02:23:39.551 --> 02:23:44.320
<v Speaker 6>through the most significant currency crisis with dozens of countries suffering</v>

4601
02:23:44.321 --> 02:23:46.900
<v Speaker 6>from hyperinflation with our currency is about to collapse,</v>

4602
02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:47.770
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4603
02:23:47.770 --> 02:23:49.900
<v Speaker 6>Europe and the euro hanging from a threads,</v>

4604
02:23:49.901 --> 02:23:54.400
<v Speaker 6>the British sterling hanging from a thread and the US dollar going crazy with</v>

4605
02:23:54.401 --> 02:23:57.190
<v Speaker 6>printing and into that environment.</v>

4606
02:23:57.730 --> 02:23:58.930
<v Speaker 6>You now have bitcoin.</v>

4607
02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.400
<v Speaker 6>It's a really interesting time to live in because there's so much change going</v>

4608
02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:05.990
<v Speaker 6>on as an escort service accepts bit coin.</v>

4609
02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:07.280
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4610
02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.300
<v Speaker 2>He's very excited.</v>

4611
02:24:08.301 --> 02:24:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Now did you put up your bitcoin address?</v>

4612
02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4613
02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:13.850
<v Speaker 2>you should say that.</v>

4614
02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll donate it all to Justin ran.</v>

4615
02:24:15.981 --> 02:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>You'll didn't donate it all to hookers,</v>

4616
02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:22.210
<v Speaker 2>corvette to all Lexis.</v>

4617
02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:27.620
<v Speaker 2>So I'm glad that we didn't get very far with a conversation about empowering the</v>

4618
02:24:27.621 --> 02:24:32.380
<v Speaker 2>poor and discussions about bitcoin can do before Brian Duff,</v>

4619
02:24:32.890 --> 02:24:33.910
<v Speaker 2>an escort site.</v>

4620
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:37.490
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to empower the poor.</v>

4621
02:24:37.491 --> 02:24:39.200
<v Speaker 2>But guess who else was poor hookers?</v>

4622
02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:40.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4623
02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4624
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.931
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4625
02:24:41.931 --> 02:24:42.764
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

4626
02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:44.993
<v Speaker 6>The best way to do it.</v>

4627
02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:48.810
<v Speaker 6>One thing that you can say about that particular cases that um,</v>

4628
02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:53.610
<v Speaker 6>women in those professions are exploited by,</v>

4629
02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:54.653
<v Speaker 6>by the men.</v>

4630
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:56.543
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

4631
02:24:56.940 --> 02:24:58.770
<v Speaker 2>The kid just sneakily post that,</v>

4632
02:24:58.980 --> 02:24:59.731
<v Speaker 2>put it on your Twitter.</v>

4633
02:24:59.731 --> 02:25:02.130
<v Speaker 2>You fuck put it on your Twitter and I'll retweet it.</v>

4634
02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:03.013
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4635
02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:06.373
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

4636
02:25:06.490 --> 02:25:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4637
02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:07.161
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

4638
02:25:07.161 --> 02:25:07.990
<v Speaker 2>They're exploited.</v>

4639
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.823
<v Speaker 2>All the money,</v>

4640
02:25:08.930 --> 02:25:12.560
<v Speaker 6>all the money flows to the men who control and exploit them.</v>

4641
02:25:12.561 --> 02:25:13.130
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4642
02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:17.040
<v Speaker 6>And so bitcoin is being used already in,</v>

4643
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:22.150
<v Speaker 6>in many cases for women to be able to keep control of their money so he can't be</v>

4644
02:25:22.461 --> 02:25:24.790
<v Speaker 6>stolen pimps and exploited,</v>

4645
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.350
<v Speaker 6>exploited boyfriends and,</v>

4646
02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:30.880
<v Speaker 6>and a hustler is in all of the other criminals who are around them who take</v>

4647
02:25:30.881 --> 02:25:31.701
<v Speaker 6>advantage of these women.</v>

4648
02:25:31.701 --> 02:25:35.830
<v Speaker 6>So actually it is quite an empowering technology even in that particular</v>

4649
02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.380
<v Speaker 6>occupation or related occupations.</v>

4650
02:25:38.381 --> 02:25:40.780
<v Speaker 6>I was having this conversation on Twitter and people with teasing me.</v>

4651
02:25:40.781 --> 02:25:41.614
<v Speaker 6>So I did a,</v>

4652
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:42.623
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4653
02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:43.553
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4654
02:25:44.770 --> 02:25:46.030
<v Speaker 6>a satirical shot.</v>

4655
02:25:46.210 --> 02:25:46.571
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4656
02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:47.020
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

4657
02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:48.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to start at the same business.</v>

4658
02:25:48.161 --> 02:25:53.161
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to post the a half naked shot of me and I'm going to make people pay</v>

4659
02:25:54.161 --> 02:25:59.161
<v Speaker 6>me to stop because I'm a pasty middle aged male and nobody wants to see that</v>

4660
02:25:59.441 --> 02:26:03.720
<v Speaker 6>shit and I'm going to donate all of the money that I raised and now it's it.</v>

4661
02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:04.900
<v Speaker 6>It went viral on Twitter.</v>

4662
02:26:04.901 --> 02:26:08.340
<v Speaker 6>It's me doing a Miley Cyrus impersonation of looking at hammer.</v>

4663
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:09.970
<v Speaker 6>It's just like from hero,</v>

4664
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:14.050
<v Speaker 6>but it's a smart move.</v>

4665
02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.490
<v Speaker 6>But I raised and,</v>

4666
02:26:15.491 --> 02:26:19.750
<v Speaker 6>and I'm pretty proud of that photo because I ridiculed and exploited myself and</v>

4667
02:26:19.751 --> 02:26:20.770
<v Speaker 6>raise $600,</v>

4668
02:26:20.771 --> 02:26:24.250
<v Speaker 6>which I donated to the rape and incest national network,</v>

4669
02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:26.410
<v Speaker 6>which is a network that helps exploited women,</v>

4670
02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:27.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4671
02:26:27.130 --> 02:26:30.370
<v Speaker 6>extract themselves from the abusive environments and gives them shelter.</v>

4672
02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:34.750
<v Speaker 6>And essentially it's like a underground railroad to get them away from people</v>

4673
02:26:34.751 --> 02:26:38.290
<v Speaker 6>who are exploiting them or abusing them badly.</v>

4674
02:26:38.470 --> 02:26:39.161
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

4675
02:26:39.161 --> 02:26:39.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4676
02:26:39.431 --> 02:26:42.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that we've talked about on this podcast before and I think</v>

4677
02:26:42.431 --> 02:26:44.140
<v Speaker 3>applies here is that there's,</v>

4678
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:49.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain morality to a lot of these big tech companies and to tech in</v>

4679
02:26:49.781 --> 02:26:53.970
<v Speaker 3>general that I don't think exists in a lot of other industries and that there's</v>

4680
02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:55.690
<v Speaker 3>a lot of companies that are coming up now.</v>

4681
02:26:55.691 --> 02:26:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Tech companies that are founded by very intelligent,</v>

4682
02:26:58.781 --> 02:27:03.781
<v Speaker 3>very educated people also have pretty strong ethics and I think that's rare for,</v>

4683
02:27:04.410 --> 02:27:06.960
<v Speaker 3>for businesses to have like a,</v>

4684
02:27:06.980 --> 02:27:11.680
<v Speaker 3>like a fairly established trend of ethical consideration involved in their</v>

4685
02:27:11.681 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 3>business practices.</v>

4686
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:16.720
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why I think is because no one understands transparency</v>

4687
02:27:16.721 --> 02:27:18.460
<v Speaker 3>more than people that are really into the Internet.</v>

4688
02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:23.740
<v Speaker 3>No one understands the implications or the ramifications rather of your actions,</v>

4689
02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:26.590
<v Speaker 3>whether positive or negative more than people that are,</v>

4690
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:28.000
<v Speaker 3>that are on the Internet.</v>

4691
02:27:28.390 --> 02:27:29.223
<v Speaker 3>What are you looking up at you?</v>

4692
02:27:29.490 --> 02:27:30.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm waiting for red vans.</v>

4693
02:27:30.531 --> 02:27:33.020
<v Speaker 6>Pull up some embarrassing photos and moment to do that.</v>

4694
02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.390
<v Speaker 6>You have that same photos then will the fe,</v>

4695
02:27:36.410 --> 02:27:37.700
<v Speaker 6>the picture that he was talking about?</v>

4696
02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:38.081
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

4697
02:27:38.081 --> 02:27:38.231
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4698
02:27:38.231 --> 02:27:38.361
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

4699
02:27:38.361 --> 02:27:38.721
<v Speaker 6>Don't,</v>

4700
02:27:38.721 --> 02:27:39.260
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>

4701
02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:39.531
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4702
02:27:39.531 --> 02:27:40.364
<v Speaker 6>I'll think.</v>

4703
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:43.130
<v Speaker 6>See he's being really nice to me today.</v>

4704
02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:43.810
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

4705
02:27:43.810 --> 02:27:44.990
<v Speaker 6>It was nice to see buddy.</v>

4706
02:27:44.991 --> 02:27:45.824
<v Speaker 6>He's always nice.</v>

4707
02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Believe me,</v>

4708
02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:47.330
<v Speaker 6>I did read though,</v>

4709
02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:50.570
<v Speaker 6>I was doing some research about the Ip of thing cause that's the only thing I</v>

4710
02:27:50.571 --> 02:27:51.051
<v Speaker 6>did have.</v>

4711
02:27:51.051 --> 02:27:54.920
<v Speaker 6>But there is some people saying that you could find the Ip if you were devoted</v>

4712
02:27:54.921 --> 02:27:55.370
<v Speaker 6>to it.</v>

4713
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:58.580
<v Speaker 6>Like meaning if I really wanted to find out what your IPO address it's using the</v>

4714
02:27:58.581 --> 02:27:59.660
<v Speaker 6>bitcoin currency,</v>

4715
02:27:59.661 --> 02:28:03.530
<v Speaker 6>I could just probably figure it out if I was really detailed about it.</v>

4716
02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:05.030
<v Speaker 6>No you can't.</v>

4717
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.510
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4718
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:08.930
<v Speaker 6>I think that's entirely wrong because um,</v>

4719
02:28:09.860 --> 02:28:11.690
<v Speaker 6>if you were doing transactions,</v>

4720
02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:16.610
<v Speaker 6>those transactions would be communicated across the peer to peer network,</v>

4721
02:28:16.611 --> 02:28:20.030
<v Speaker 6>kind of like bittorrent and they spread through that peer to peer network in</v>

4722
02:28:20.031 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 6>such a way that you can't even with the transaction happened.</v>

4723
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:25.400
<v Speaker 5>But in your particular case you're not even doing any transactions.</v>

4724
02:28:25.810 --> 02:28:26.643
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4725
02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:31.660
<v Speaker 5>there is no way to associate a bit coin address to an Ip address unless you're</v>

4726
02:28:31.791 --> 02:28:34.350
<v Speaker 5>monitoring that person specific communication.</v>

4727
02:28:34.351 --> 02:28:35.184
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

4728
02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:37.160
<v Speaker 5>if someone's monitoring your laptop,</v>

4729
02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:39.350
<v Speaker 5>they can figure out your connected to that Ip address.</v>

4730
02:28:39.351 --> 02:28:40.190
<v Speaker 5>But guess what?</v>

4731
02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:41.420
<v Speaker 5>If they're monitoring your laptop,</v>

4732
02:28:41.421 --> 02:28:43.310
<v Speaker 5>they already know that it's not so hard.</v>

4733
02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:46.280
<v Speaker 5>But just monitoring the bitcoin network,</v>

4734
02:28:46.281 --> 02:28:50.390
<v Speaker 5>you cannot associate addresses to bitcoin addresses to Ip addresses.</v>

4735
02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:52.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm putting up Dorian Nakamoto goes,</v>

4736
02:28:52.751 --> 02:28:52.890
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4737
02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:54.140
<v Speaker 5>I retweeted yours,</v>

4738
02:28:54.141 --> 02:28:55.370
<v Speaker 5>Brian and,</v>

4739
02:28:55.371 --> 02:28:56.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4740
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.550
<v Speaker 5>contribute to Dorian Nakamoto</v>

4741
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.750
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

4742
02:29:00.750 --> 02:29:02.270
<v Speaker 5>How do you spell Dorian?</v>

4743
02:29:02.271 --> 02:29:02.691
<v Speaker 5>Dorian?</v>

4744
02:29:02.691 --> 02:29:02.841
<v Speaker 5>T.</v>

4745
02:29:02.841 --> 02:29:05.660
<v Speaker 5>O r I a n and knock a moto.</v>

4746
02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:05.991
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

4747
02:29:05.991 --> 02:29:06.411
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

4748
02:29:06.411 --> 02:29:07.250
<v Speaker 5>How you see you hear it.</v>

4749
02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:12.310
<v Speaker 5>Do you know who damn Kaminsky is a chief scientist for d k h he wrote in 2011</v>

4750
02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:16.093
<v Speaker 5>that you could,</v>

4751
02:29:16.330 --> 02:29:17.163
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4752
02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:19.100
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>

4753
02:29:19.310 --> 02:29:20.210
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I</v>

4754
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:24.200
<v Speaker 5>was basing my findings on.</v>

4755
02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:27.980
<v Speaker 5>He said that unless you're a very careful in the way you use bitcoin and you</v>

4756
02:29:27.981 --> 02:29:32.240
<v Speaker 5>have the technical know how to use it with other anonymizing to technologies</v>

4757
02:29:32.241 --> 02:29:33.860
<v Speaker 5>like tour or ITP,</v>

4758
02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:37.850
<v Speaker 5>you should assume that a persistent motivated attacker will be able to associate</v>

4759
02:29:37.851 --> 02:29:40.520
<v Speaker 5>your IP address with your bitcoin transactions</v>

4760
02:29:42.470 --> 02:29:47.470
<v Speaker 5>and Black Hawk black hat 2011 talk.</v>

4761
02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:48.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4762
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:48.731
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

4763
02:29:48.731 --> 02:29:49.700
<v Speaker 5>and that's not their,</v>

4764
02:29:49.730 --> 02:29:52.400
<v Speaker 5>they're not associating the Ip address,</v>

4765
02:29:52.401 --> 02:29:54.350
<v Speaker 5>the bitcoin address because it's in the network.</v>

4766
02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:59.360
<v Speaker 5>While we're talking about there is a determined attacker who's conducting</v>

4767
02:29:59.991 --> 02:30:04.010
<v Speaker 5>surveillance of the entire network and has the resources to track down what's</v>

4768
02:30:04.011 --> 02:30:04.640
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

4769
02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.280
<v Speaker 5>And so people say that bitcoin is anonymous,</v>

4770
02:30:07.281 --> 02:30:08.420
<v Speaker 5>but in fact it's not.</v>

4771
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:10.860
<v Speaker 5>It's pseudonymous and loosely synonymous.</v>

4772
02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:15.880
<v Speaker 5>That means that if you conduct activities with Bitcoin that associate your</v>

4773
02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:18.680
<v Speaker 5>bitcoin address to other things,</v>

4774
02:30:18.681 --> 02:30:19.610
<v Speaker 5>like for example,</v>

4775
02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:24.080
<v Speaker 5>you use it to buy something and then that's something gets shipped to your home.</v>

4776
02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:27.980
<v Speaker 5>Well now you tied that bitcoin address to your physical address,</v>

4777
02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:29.360
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4778
02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Or um,</v>

4779
02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:33.890
<v Speaker 5>I have a donation address that I publish.</v>

4780
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:35.570
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows that's my address.</v>

4781
02:30:35.571 --> 02:30:37.790
<v Speaker 5>Now if I take money from that bit coin address,</v>

4782
02:30:37.791 --> 02:30:42.320
<v Speaker 5>which my donation address and I move it into my wallets that I use to spend on</v>

4783
02:30:42.321 --> 02:30:42.861
<v Speaker 5>other things.</v>

4784
02:30:42.861 --> 02:30:44.990
<v Speaker 5>Now everyone can track that step by step.</v>

4785
02:30:44.991 --> 02:30:45.171
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4786
02:30:45.171 --> 02:30:48.860
<v Speaker 5>well that's my wallet and then track everything that goes out of that wallet.</v>

4787
02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:54.640
<v Speaker 5>So I have to take some basic privacy precautions to protect against that.</v>

4788
02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:57.590
<v Speaker 5>Now would there be cause like it's kind of like an account number,</v>

4789
02:30:57.591 --> 02:30:58.580
<v Speaker 5>I guess like at a bank,</v>

4790
02:30:58.581 --> 02:30:59.414
<v Speaker 5>like you said.</v>

4791
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.751
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4792
02:30:59.751 --> 02:31:03.470
<v Speaker 5>is there technology or is or hackers that can take knowing your,</v>

4793
02:31:03.471 --> 02:31:08.471
<v Speaker 5>your account number and recreate it in a program that makes it seem like you are</v>

4794
02:31:09.411 --> 02:31:11.240
<v Speaker 5>that person and uh,</v>

4795
02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:13.430
<v Speaker 5>like transfer money out of that account?</v>

4796
02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:13.881
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4797
02:31:13.881 --> 02:31:14.391
<v Speaker 5>because the,</v>

4798
02:31:14.391 --> 02:31:18.890
<v Speaker 5>the address itself is essentially one part of an encryption key.</v>

4799
02:31:19.410 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

4800
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.200
<v Speaker 7>the other part of the pair of keys,</v>

4801
02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:25.680
<v Speaker 7>the private key is the thing you have on your phone wallet,</v>

4802
02:31:26.050 --> 02:31:26.710
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

4803
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:27.720
<v Speaker 7>That's the secret.</v>

4804
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:30.540
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing that allows you to sign transactions.</v>

4805
02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:35.840
<v Speaker 7>And the whole basis of cryptography of encryption systems is that you can't go</v>

4806
02:31:36.211 --> 02:31:38.550
<v Speaker 7>from the public address to the private secret.</v>

4807
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:40.350
<v Speaker 7>You can't go backwards.</v>

4808
02:31:40.650 --> 02:31:42.030
<v Speaker 7>You can go from the private secret,</v>

4809
02:31:42.031 --> 02:31:43.740
<v Speaker 7>you can recreate the public address,</v>

4810
02:31:43.741 --> 02:31:44.790
<v Speaker 7>but you can't go backwards.</v>

4811
02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:49.200
<v Speaker 7>That is the whole basis that technology is the same technology that's used to</v>

4812
02:31:49.201 --> 02:31:50.280
<v Speaker 7>secure a bank networks.</v>

4813
02:31:50.281 --> 02:31:53.790
<v Speaker 7>It's the same technology that's used to secure Tomahawk missiles.</v>

4814
02:31:53.791 --> 02:31:56.460
<v Speaker 7>It's the same technology that's used to secure everything.</v>

4815
02:31:57.090 --> 02:31:57.923
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>

4816
02:31:58.620 --> 02:31:59.250
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4817
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:04.250
<v Speaker 7>you can rest assured that the cryptography at the core of bitcoin is solid</v>

4818
02:32:05.821 --> 02:32:08.820
<v Speaker 7>because it's used across all of the other industries.</v>

4819
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.921
<v Speaker 6>Be better off like,</v>

4820
02:32:09.921 --> 02:32:10.091
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

4821
02:32:10.091 --> 02:32:13.820
<v Speaker 6>when a charged my phone on your laptop and then you just download their phone</v>

4822
02:32:13.821 --> 02:32:16.700
<v Speaker 6>and then re upload it on your phone and then you have their wallet and you</v>

4823
02:32:16.701 --> 02:32:17.534
<v Speaker 6>shave.</v>

4824
02:32:18.410 --> 02:32:21.530
<v Speaker 6>So that's why you have masterminds blueprint,</v>

4825
02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:24.650
<v Speaker 6>so that's why you have a password on that application so that if he,</v>

4826
02:32:24.651 --> 02:32:25.700
<v Speaker 6>if you steal the data,</v>

4827
02:32:25.701 --> 02:32:26.030
<v Speaker 6>if that up</v>

4828
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.601
<v Speaker 7>application,</v>

4829
02:32:26.601 --> 02:32:27.201
<v Speaker 7>it's encrypted,</v>

4830
02:32:27.201 --> 02:32:29.180
<v Speaker 7>then you can't see the keys that are underneath.</v>

4831
02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:29.570
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4832
02:32:29.570 --> 02:32:33.590
<v Speaker 7>That's what the pin number and password do and I have a secondary password.</v>

4833
02:32:33.591 --> 02:32:36.500
<v Speaker 7>Those also prevents from spending specifically for spending.</v>

4834
02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:37.361
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

4835
02:32:37.361 --> 02:32:37.541
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4836
02:32:37.541 --> 02:32:38.830
<v Speaker 2>you want to do this again in three months?</v>

4837
02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:39.841
<v Speaker 6>I'd love to.</v>

4838
02:32:39.841 --> 02:32:41.630
<v Speaker 6>It's about three years in bitcoin time.</v>

4839
02:32:41.631 --> 02:32:42.960
<v Speaker 6>A lot of things will change.</v>

4840
02:32:43.890 --> 02:32:46.020
<v Speaker 6>Well that really appreciate every opportunity.</v>

4841
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it as well.</v>

4842
02:32:47.211 --> 02:32:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were very,</v>

4843
02:32:48.141 --> 02:32:51.950
<v Speaker 2>very informative and we've never be this educated about this stuff.</v>

4844
02:32:51.951 --> 02:32:55.280
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for you and I think you'd do a huge service to not just the tech</v>

4845
02:32:55.281 --> 02:32:56.091
<v Speaker 2>community with this,</v>

4846
02:32:56.091 --> 02:32:58.010
<v Speaker 2>but just the general population,</v>

4847
02:32:58.011 --> 02:32:59.930
<v Speaker 2>giving them an understanding of what this is all about.</v>

4848
02:32:59.931 --> 02:33:03.020
<v Speaker 2>There's so much misinformation and confusion about it.</v>

4849
02:33:03.021 --> 02:33:03.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4850
02:33:03.231 --> 02:33:07.190
<v Speaker 2>we had just Brian and I to fucking dunces sitting there staring at each other,</v>

4851
02:33:07.191 --> 02:33:09.170
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what it was before you came along.</v>

4852
02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:11.240
<v Speaker 2>So it helps us tremendously.</v>

4853
02:33:11.241 --> 02:33:12.051
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

4854
02:33:12.051 --> 02:33:12.321
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4855
02:33:12.321 --> 02:33:13.500
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is,</v>

4856
02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:14.581
<v Speaker 2>is it's,</v>

4857
02:33:14.581 --> 02:33:15.710
<v Speaker 2>it's brave.</v>

4858
02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:16.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4859
02:33:16.041 --> 02:33:16.181
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4860
02:33:16.181 --> 02:33:18.080
<v Speaker 2>you're getting paid through bitcoin.</v>

4861
02:33:18.081 --> 02:33:18.980
<v Speaker 2>It's noble.</v>

4862
02:33:18.981 --> 02:33:19.410
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

4863
02:33:19.410 --> 02:33:21.560
<v Speaker 2>you're using it in great ways.</v>

4864
02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I love what you did for Nakamoto.</v>

4865
02:33:23.601 --> 02:33:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I just posted his,</v>

4866
02:33:24.921 --> 02:33:29.300
<v Speaker 2>a bitcoin address along with an article explaining what went wrong and how he's</v>

4867
02:33:29.301 --> 02:33:30.170
<v Speaker 2>not that guy.</v>

4868
02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:30.891
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4869
02:33:30.891 --> 02:33:31.724
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4870
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's cool as fuck,</v>

4871
02:33:32.961 --> 02:33:33.410
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4872
02:33:33.410 --> 02:33:33.830
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4873
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm honored that you're a part of this.</v>

4874
02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:35.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4875
02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:36.411
<v Speaker 6>thank you so much.</v>

4876
02:33:36.411 --> 02:33:36.501
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4877
02:33:36.501 --> 02:33:40.370
<v Speaker 6>and what I'm doing is I'm just expressing my enthusiasm for this space,</v>

4878
02:33:40.371 --> 02:33:44.780
<v Speaker 6>but let me tell you a couple of quick stories about why this was awesome.</v>

4879
02:33:45.050 --> 02:33:45.620
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4880
02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:47.530
<v Speaker 6>after the first Joe Rogan experience,</v>

4881
02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:48.320
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4882
02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:52.850
<v Speaker 6>suddenly I had people everywhere coming and telling me that they got into</v>

4883
02:33:52.851 --> 02:33:54.410
<v Speaker 6>bitcoin because of that first show,</v>

4884
02:33:54.411 --> 02:33:56.480
<v Speaker 6>because they finally were able to understand it.</v>

4885
02:33:56.481 --> 02:33:57.500
<v Speaker 6>And I'll give you two stories.</v>

4886
02:33:57.860 --> 02:33:58.641
<v Speaker 6>A month ago,</v>

4887
02:33:58.641 --> 02:33:59.780
<v Speaker 6>I was in a Houston airport.</v>

4888
02:33:59.781 --> 02:34:01.160
<v Speaker 6>I was sitting down having lunch.</v>

4889
02:34:01.161 --> 02:34:04.730
<v Speaker 6>I was in transits between flights and I'm sitting there and someone sees my</v>

4890
02:34:04.731 --> 02:34:05.381
<v Speaker 6>watch and they go,</v>

4891
02:34:05.381 --> 02:34:05.421
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4892
02:34:05.421 --> 02:34:06.440
<v Speaker 6>is that the new pebble?</v>

4893
02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:06.801
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

4894
02:34:06.801 --> 02:34:07.131
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4895
02:34:07.131 --> 02:34:07.461
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>

4896
02:34:07.461 --> 02:34:10.490
<v Speaker 6>You could write applications and what kind of applications as well.</v>

4897
02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:11.780
<v Speaker 6>The application I have on here,</v>

4898
02:34:11.781 --> 02:34:15.230
<v Speaker 6>which is pretty cool is I can check bitcoin addresses and like bitcoin</v>

4899
02:34:15.231 --> 02:34:15.800
<v Speaker 6>addresses.</v>

4900
02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:15.921
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4901
02:34:15.921 --> 02:34:16.670
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty cool.</v>

4902
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:17.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4903
02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:17.291
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

4904
02:34:17.291 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 6>you heard a bitcoin?</v>

4905
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.191
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4906
02:34:18.191 --> 02:34:19.024
<v Speaker 6>I've heard of bitcoin.</v>

4907
02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:19.451
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

4908
02:34:19.451 --> 02:34:20.440
<v Speaker 6>hang on a second.</v>

4909
02:34:20.770 --> 02:34:23.350
<v Speaker 6>Is Your name and your absence and all pillows are like,</v>

4910
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:24.333
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4911
02:34:24.470 --> 02:34:25.720
<v Speaker 6>Were you on Joe Rogan?</v>

4912
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:27.880
<v Speaker 6>You're the reason I bought bitcoin.</v>

4913
02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:32.140
<v Speaker 6>I got involved in bitcoin after seeing that episodes and I was just blown away.</v>

4914
02:34:32.141 --> 02:34:32.411
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4915
02:34:32.411 --> 02:34:35.800
<v Speaker 6>this is like I'm sitting down for lunch and a transit area in a restaurant.</v>

4916
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:38.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm not used to being recognized that way,</v>

4917
02:34:38.740 --> 02:34:39.970
<v Speaker 6>so the better part.</v>

4918
02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:41.133
<v Speaker 6>Monday,</v>

4919
02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:43.810
<v Speaker 6>yesterday I landed at lax.</v>

4920
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:45.011
<v Speaker 6>I go to enterprise,</v>

4921
02:34:45.011 --> 02:34:46.330
<v Speaker 6>rent a car to pick up my car.</v>

4922
02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:47.350
<v Speaker 6>I get into my car,</v>

4923
02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:48.400
<v Speaker 6>I drive to the exit.</v>

4924
02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:53.520
<v Speaker 6>I had my driver's license and rental tickets to the booth guy at the exit and he</v>

4925
02:34:53.771 --> 02:34:55.150
<v Speaker 6>takes a look at it and he goes,</v>

4926
02:34:56.140 --> 02:34:57.580
<v Speaker 6>were you in the Joe Rogan experience?</v>

4927
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:59.620
<v Speaker 6>Like yeah,</v>

4928
02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:01.000
<v Speaker 6>you're the reason I bought bitcoin.</v>

4929
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:04.690
<v Speaker 6>You're the reason I got into bitcoin and I follow you on Twitter in the Joe</v>

4930
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:06.130
<v Speaker 6>Rogan experience got me into bitcoin.</v>

4931
02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:11.340
<v Speaker 6>This story has repeated a thousand times for me and not just from 15,000 people</v>

4932
02:35:12.971 --> 02:35:15.370
<v Speaker 6>on Twitter who started following me after the first show.</v>

4933
02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:16.230
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4934
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:20.770
<v Speaker 6>and who got excited about bitcoin but complete strangers in the street and</v>

4935
02:35:20.771 --> 02:35:21.401
<v Speaker 6>things like that.</v>

4936
02:35:21.401 --> 02:35:21.821
<v Speaker 6>And yes,</v>

4937
02:35:21.821 --> 02:35:24.430
<v Speaker 6>I get my share of crazies and stalkers and all of that.</v>

4938
02:35:24.431 --> 02:35:28.480
<v Speaker 6>And it doesn't matter because the vast majority is such a positive experience.</v>

4939
02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:32.920
<v Speaker 6>And what everyone says is that you asked really great questions.</v>

4940
02:35:32.921 --> 02:35:35.350
<v Speaker 6>You asked the every man questions the question,</v>

4941
02:35:35.351 --> 02:35:40.060
<v Speaker 6>everybody wanted to ask the simple questions that to try to understand and grasp</v>

4942
02:35:40.061 --> 02:35:41.380
<v Speaker 6>this topic.</v>

4943
02:35:41.381 --> 02:35:44.470
<v Speaker 6>And for me that was a wonderful opportunity.</v>

4944
02:35:44.471 --> 02:35:45.200
<v Speaker 6>So thank you.</v>

4945
02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:45.891
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

4946
02:35:45.891 --> 02:35:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Listen.</v>

4947
02:35:46.310 --> 02:35:50.480
<v Speaker 2>The beautiful thing about having a podcast is nobody brings anything on the show</v>

4948
02:35:50.481 --> 02:35:51.620
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not interested in.</v>

4949
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:55.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a network demands that I interviewed this guy who was on this</v>

4950
02:35:55.011 --> 02:35:56.180
<v Speaker 2>sitcom or something like that.</v>

4951
02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:57.530
<v Speaker 2>If I'm talking to somebody,</v>

4952
02:35:57.531 --> 02:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>it's because the subject is fascinating and that it's actually something I'm</v>

4953
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:07.030
<v Speaker 2>truly interested in and that's not having all those sort of like ladders and</v>

4954
02:36:08.301 --> 02:36:12.460
<v Speaker 2>steps that you have to climb to put content out is really what it's all about in</v>

4955
02:36:12.470 --> 02:36:14.900
<v Speaker 2>in a way that sort of mirrors what bitcoin is.</v>
