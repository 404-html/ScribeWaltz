<v Speaker 1>A pot.</v>

11
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

12
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>what was a fight companion?</v>

13
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a podcast.</v>

14
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

16
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it is definitely a podcast,</v>

17
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>but we're sort of watching the fights and calling the fights,</v>

18
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but probably most likely not that much,</v>

19
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's fun and the nonsense meter hits red hot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I did Duncan [inaudible] Duncan Duncan trussell's podcast,</v>

39
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>and he introduced me to the world of virtual reality goggles.</v>

40
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Ho Lee Shit.</v>

41
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you something,</v>

42
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>going to show you this game.</v>

43
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a boxing game.</v>

44
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Look up in the upper left hand corner.</v>

45
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

46
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>This is a boxing game.</v>

47
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>So I have these gloves on and it's kind of wacky because a,</v>

48
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>the gloves aren't the way you punch your,</v>

49
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>you're holding onto these handles and I'm,</v>

50
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting this,</v>

51
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>this Russian boxing coach.</v>

52
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

53
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you're punching looks good.</v>

54
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

55
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>But here's what's goofy about it.</v>

56
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>In order for your fist to B level,</v>

57
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>like parallel with the ground,</v>

58
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you have to hold them like this.</v>

59
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Like a joy stick.</v>

60
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So you're looking at your,</v>

62
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.081
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

63
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're holding your hands like this,</v>

64
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I sold in your hands with your,</v>

65
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>

67
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

68
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

69
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>the heel of your hand facing the ground and your songs up in the air.</v>

70
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

71
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Like your skiing's.</v>

72
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>That's if you're holding your hands like that,</v>

73
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>your punches are parallel with the floor.</v>

74
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

76
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.103
<v Speaker 1>it's twisted.</v>

77
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

78
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>They should make it so that you could hold your hand like an actual punch.</v>

79
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.511
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

80
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>So like wherever your hands are,</v>

81
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>that's where your gloves are.</v>

82
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>So I'm holding it like this and I'm punching like this.</v>

83
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird cause you're not,</v>

84
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it looks like really good exercise though.</v>

85
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that a prototype shop by the,</v>

86
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>by that there's a bunch of games for these things now.</v>

87
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>But here's my point.</v>

88
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I was moving around this guy like,</v>

89
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>like he's throwing punches at me.</v>

90
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving around.</v>

91
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I kept hitting him in the back of the head.</v>

92
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I would sneak around behind him and beat him in the back of her head and upper</v>

93
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>cut them and I'm,</v>

94
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:50.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this.</v>

95
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

96
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.961
<v Speaker 1>oh my foot words.</v>

97
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:52.531
<v Speaker 1>All awkward.</v>

98
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

99
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I felt weird like I'm in this virtual world.</v>

100
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>But after I did it a few times,</v>

101
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I started to get the feeling of it.</v>

102
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

103
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.230
<v Speaker 1>this is an amazing shadow boxing programs.</v>

104
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>But he's sick.</v>

105
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

106
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I think you can do more tie with it too.</v>

107
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I think you could have it so that you could throw kicks,</v>

108
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>because it was getting me,</v>

109
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>it was getting all my movement from these two cameras that Dunkin has set up in</v>

110
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.281
<v Speaker 1>the room there,</v>

111
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>motion detectors,</v>

112
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>so the cameras,</v>

113
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>they scan you when you're standing there and then they build a perimeter around</v>

114
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>you and there's a blue line on the ground.</v>

115
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You look down and you're in this three d world,</v>

116
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>but you see this blue line on the ground.</v>

117
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't go pass that Blue Line because that's the amount of free space that</v>

118
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.001
<v Speaker 1>you have in your area.</v>

119
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

120
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

121
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.273
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

122
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You could download the opponent you're going to fight and they can come shadow</v>

123
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.901
<v Speaker 1>box against.</v>

124
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

125
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly</v>

126
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.883
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying.</v>

127
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>If you could make a a training simulation of a god,</v>

128
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you could fight him a hundred times before you ever actually fight him.</v>

129
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>That when I was seeing him in front of you,</v>

130
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:50.321
<v Speaker 1>and I'm telling you,</v>

131
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

132
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>what I was looking at was kind of cartoonish.</v>

133
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Like this Russian boxing guys [inaudible] he's got a wife beater on and headgear</v>

134
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.851
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

135
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:58.601
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cartoonish,</v>

136
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have to be,</v>

137
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

138
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>It's only cartoonish now.</v>

139
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Like you could get to a point within a few years where you know you're going to</v>

140
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>be boxing and it looks exactly like Joe Schilling and has his tendencies,</v>

141
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>big of a deal.</v>

143
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.981
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>

144
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you can do that can be a big of an advantage.</v>

145
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.523
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

146
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Certainly be a great training tool often Stein,</v>

147
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but we got a ways to go look at it.</v>

148
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:20.561
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

149
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>this is what it looks like.</v>

150
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.761
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

151
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.211
<v Speaker 1>so your,</v>

152
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

153
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>your gloves.</v>

154
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like you have to kind of turn your gloves fucky so that they look</v>

155
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>normal on the screen.</v>

156
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

157
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

158
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda dope.</v>

159
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to do.</v>

160
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what,</v>

161
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>this isn't nearly as fun as the archery program.</v>

162
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>There was an archery one.</v>

163
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:43.561
<v Speaker 1>When you're in a castle and you all a roof and you hear and he's fucking</v>

164
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>warriors come storming at you and they have helmets on and they have shields and</v>

165
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting arrows at them.</v>

166
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Sounds send you.</v>

167
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And you have,</v>

168
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's the same handles though,</v>

169
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Or do you have the same goofy hand?</v>

171
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

172
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.861
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

173
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>but there's haptic feedback.</v>

174
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>So this is the archery one that I was playing.</v>

175
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Those graphics are fucking tough too.</v>

176
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like an a tall,</v>

177
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like Nintendo 64 but I'm telling you,</v>

178
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're dealing with massive amounts of rendering in real time,</v>

179
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>360 degrees,</v>

180
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.763
<v Speaker 1>up and down.</v>

181
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>And these are all new things,</v>

182
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>but you get to use them.</v>

183
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>But I was jacking these motherfuckers up.</v>

184
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.913
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hey,</v>

185
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I was giving some angle on horseback.</v>

186
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I am so,</v>

187
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.211
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

188
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So when you pull the bow back,</v>

189
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no resistance,</v>

190
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's this vibration,</v>

191
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like shaking as you pull it back.</v>

192
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So it really feels like you're pulling it back and then it gets to the point</v>

193
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.531
<v Speaker 1>where it's locked out.</v>

194
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>You feel it like click as a fucking cool dude.</v>

195
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:39.664
<v Speaker 1>It's dope.</v>

196
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I shot,</v>

197
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>I shot this stupid fucking game until my arms were so sore.</v>

198
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>They were shaking.</v>

199
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna say homes now video.</v>

200
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Now gamers are probably going to look like MMA fighters,</v>

201
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.701
<v Speaker 1>or at least runners.</v>

202
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:52.391
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna be in shape.</v>

203
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:52.931
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

204
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:53.201
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

205
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>if you remember last dance dance revolution,</v>

206
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

207
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.540
<v Speaker 1>hell that we're losing like 30 pounds on dance dance.</v>

208
00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

209
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>First fight is on.</v>

210
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's between two ladies.</v>

211
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.211
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

212
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>we do not have the names yet.</v>

213
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Jay.</v>

214
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Jay Mckee pull up the card.</v>

215
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>So we'll uh,</v>

216
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>let people know.</v>

217
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen this tall woman fight in a,</v>

218
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I think tough round one of three.</v>

219
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's at four 43,</v>

220
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>two one zero harmful rash guy.</v>

221
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:19.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

223
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>they've just passed new rules today.</v>

224
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make women wear a tight fitting clothing.</v>

225
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:27.090
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to allow a loose fitting clothing worn loose.</v>

226
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>This girl's got shorts.</v>

227
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>how tied of those,</v>

229
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I think they should all wear spend X.</v>

230
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I think mentioned too,</v>

231
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I've seen guys grab shorts.</v>

232
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

233
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>if you go back to the chill son and Anderson Silva fight is a famous picture of</v>

234
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva straps on short round check Congo.</v>

235
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.191
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

236
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like last year alone,</v>

237
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like women have gotten exponentially better.</v>

238
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

239
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.660

251
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Chanko the woman who just beat Holly Holm,</v>

252
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.570

<v Speaker 1>You can be trouble for lunch.</v>

258
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.300
<v Speaker 1>She's got it in her DNA where she's throwing them spinning back fist calendar.</v>

259
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 1>She's got that down better than anybody,</v>

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.211
<v Speaker 1>girls like Holly,</v>

276
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.730

284
00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:14.331
<v Speaker 1>She's strong.</v>

285
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>She's not like Ameesha is loves far as grappling.</v>

286
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>But when she fought Sarah Kaufman and her first fight,</v>

287
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>she out grappled her.</v>

288
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like I did.</v>

289
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>She's a Pfizer with the date.</v>

291
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>if I remember what she's a beast man.</v>

292
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I feel like Holly's hesitant lately.</v>

293
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.143
<v Speaker 1>Hey Man,</v>

294
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.690
<v Speaker 1>no joke dude.</v>

295
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

296
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 1>She called crap with that counter right hook.</v>

297
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>That lead counter hook.</v>

298
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>She kept taking her head off the sound line and just</v>

299
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>was Holly though?</v>

300
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

302
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>she has.</v>

303
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that Holly is in more of a boxing world but she's a 19 time</v>

304
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>boxing champion?</v>

305
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Like Holly's boxing,</v>

306
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>like as far as her footwork or speed or movement especially are counters like</v>

307
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:59.510
<v Speaker 1>when someone should count it after she's brilliant.</v>

308
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.433
<v Speaker 1>Counter striker.</v>

309
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I feel like Holly is the fastest,</v>

310
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>probably the fastest Stryker as far as just being able to get her shots off,</v>

311
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>like if you were at a time.</v>

312
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>She said when she throws to somebodies face,</v>

313
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>she's certainly fast,</v>

314
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but I mean in her weight class maybe she's the fastest is going,</v>

315
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.490
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

316
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to shut your fucking mouth.</v>

317
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen you want to do those videos on Twitter where her trainers holding</v>

318
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>pads and she's ripping into him?</v>

319
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:23.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 1>it's fake dude.</v>

321
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>She's insane.</v>

322
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.110
<v Speaker 1>She's the best striker in there.</v>

323
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

324
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

325
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>if you could pull some of those up,</v>

326
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>if you could try this even even among guys,</v>

327
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge thing to say.</v>

328
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

329
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say Wonderboy would argue with that.</v>

330
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

331
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.460
<v Speaker 1>would say that there's a few other fighters that are just strikers over and</v>

332
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 1>being k one Grand Prix champion.</v>

333
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know what man?</v>

334
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>You want it just like what the real problem is like saying she's the best or at</v>

335
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:54.800
<v Speaker 1>one person's the best.</v>

336
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so subjective,</v>

337
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>especially if they'd never gonna fight each other.</v>

338
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

339
00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 1>We all love to do it.</v>

340
00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It all depends.</v>

341
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 1>A caliber of person you're fighting to watch this live this,</v>

342
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>she's doing these sprawls and then she's getting up fire combinations.</v>

343
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>You look at pure technique though,</v>

344
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:07.651
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

345
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking nightmare.</v>

346
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

347
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>She's so sharp in the fight too.</v>

348
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 1>she's super don't see over in with that same technique.</v>

350
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:15.841
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>

351
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 1>he's a k one world champion.</v>

352
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:17.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

353
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>it's different too,</v>

354
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to compare 115 pound girl,</v>

355
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 1>202 Gilliam pound man and kind of tough.</v>

356
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>He smoked junior dos Santos with one shot to Kilian bound that.</v>

357
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

358
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:28.224
<v Speaker 1>That's funny to me.</v>

359
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>He smoked junior dos Santos one left hook.</v>

360
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean Alistair Overeem is a beast.</v>

361
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

362
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>he's a beast of the beast.</v>

363
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard,</v>

364
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to look at him the same way you look at anybody else because first of</v>

365
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:41.341
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

366
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>he's in a division where anyone connects,</v>

367
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes night night,</v>

368
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

370
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's such finding different,</v>

371
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:51.530
<v Speaker 1>such a totally different kind of see his technique because at one of his jabs</v>

372
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll knock him the fuck out.</v>

373
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>So you don't see five rounds of over him like you do with y'all.</v>

374
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Like y'all will go the distance and her technique will be flawless from minute</v>

375
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>one in the first round to minute one in the neck.</v>

376
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.911
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

377
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>But she can also tend to be somebody at that size can afford to be and take more</v>

378
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>chances and actually standing in the pocket and,</v>

379
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.441
<v Speaker 1>and throw out.</v>

380
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you guys at your weight,</v>

381
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be so careful because one mistake the market is,</v>

382
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I got other,</v>

383
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying heavyweights one,</v>

384
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.473
<v Speaker 1>the margin for error.</v>

385
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's so much smaller.</v>

386
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent you're totally right.</v>

387
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.823
<v Speaker 1>100% Brian.</v>

388
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that these guys,</v>

389
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like Ben Rothwell,</v>

391
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>like Ben Rothwell knocked out over him and the first round and now Overeem was</v>

392
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>going to be fighting.</v>

393
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>So the title against steeping,</v>

394
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>but Ben Rothwell just got like a full five round beating by junior dos.</v>

395
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Santos dealt with Juno sentos boxes face off.</v>

396
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

397
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It was like the best junior has looked in you and kicked him front kick and then</v>

398
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think that Alister knocked down junior.</v>

399
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

400
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.051
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

401
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Math and the heavyweight division is bananas.</v>

402
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

403
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 1>There's silly,</v>

404
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.321
<v Speaker 1>super silly.</v>

405
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is so powerful.</v>

407
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is so big like Steve Bay knocking out for doom like that.</v>

408
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

409
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

410
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>nothing crazy ass division in the craziest sport.</v>

411
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's also an older division.</v>

412
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:12.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what's amazing to me to meet any young heavyweight tour,</v>

413
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 1>2122 like that age,</v>

414
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.980

<v Speaker 1>He looks like straight Predator.</v>

436
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I am telling you when that dude moves in on guys and he throws bombs on them,</v>

437
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

438
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for a really solid opponent for him because like we have not seen</v>

439
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.281
<v Speaker 1>him test.</v>

440
00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 1>He's fought all scrubs.</v>

441
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>We have and starched.</v>

442
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:52.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>We have not seen him tested,</v>

444
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.680

445
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

446
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And he's got very sharp technique.</v>

447
00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.673
<v Speaker 1>How old is he?</v>

448
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>He's young.</v>

449

<v Speaker 1>He's 28 28 how old is he?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

461
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster though.</v>

462
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

463
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.593
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

464
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>he's in his prime for sure.</v>

465
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:21.221

468
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Derrick Lewis with the BBC that Derrick Lewis looks so good in that Roy Nelson</v>

469
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

470
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.031
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

471
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:28.631

00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:29.381
<v Speaker 1>Fight to man.</v>

474
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It's combinations were fast.</v>

475
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.531
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

476
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>he looked like really improved.</v>

477
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:34.541
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

478
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you see a guy fight and you go,</v>

480
00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:36.731
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

481
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 1>this guy hit another level.</v>

482
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how it was he the guy who got knocked out by Mitzrian?</v>

483
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

484
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:41.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

485
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:42.061
<v Speaker 1>we were in the,</v>

486
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:43.330
<v Speaker 1>he just wasn't ready for that.</v>

487
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.410
<v Speaker 1>But that Roy Nelson is a huge step and to go three rounds with Roy,</v>

488
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>there couldn't be a better thing for his career because he's just starching</v>

489
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:51.491
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

490
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn shit.</v>

491
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:52.841
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

492
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn shit.</v>

493
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you go three rounds with a vet.</v>

494
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Like Roy.</v>

495
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I was just so impressed with his combinations is most impressive.</v>

496
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.281
<v Speaker 1>So like wow.</v>

497
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>The way he's putting it together and his endurance too.</v>

498
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause I thought it was just a meathead like throwing bombs but down for a lot</v>

499
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>with you look at his previous sites kind of like,</v>

500
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

501
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Speaker 1>He's just a big powerful guy.</v>

502
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:09.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

503
00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:10.271
<v Speaker 1>You went through at hand.</v>

504
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>The guy's going to sleep,</v>

505
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but you look at Roy like shitty splitting combos together,</v>

506
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:13.541
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

507
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

508
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.553
<v Speaker 1>he was carted.</v>

509
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh He,</v>

510
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

511
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>he put real good combination so you can see him for sure.</v>

512
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:20.944
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

513
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>the Predator,</v>

514
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

515
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 1>that would be a very interesting fight.</v>

516
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

517
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>he's had much more experience against,</v>

518
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

519
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like higher level guys,</v>

520
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:30.101
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd say.</v>

521
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

522
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Mitre own.</v>

523
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>And now Roy Nelson,</v>

524
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>but Mitchell and stuff can you got starched so didn't get a lot of experience.</v>

525
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really learn as true.</v>

526
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Speaker 1>But how many fights is Derek had now in the UFC?</v>

527
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I to say four.</v>

528
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Five fibers.</v>

529
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.703
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

530
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 1>The thing is with both those guys,</v>

531
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>if you give them,</v>

532
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:51.250
<v Speaker 1>cause we can get the top,</v>

534
00:14:51.251 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>not every guy's going to sit there and bang with you.</v>

535
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:53.601
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

536
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 1>You can get a wrestler.</v>

537
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

538
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.511
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about good,</v>

539
00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:56.730
<v Speaker 1>no is his Moy Tai.</v>

540
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.101
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

541
00:14:57.101 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 1>what makes me super interested in him,</v>

542
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.411
<v Speaker 1>not just his,</v>

543
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:01.244
<v Speaker 1>his speed,</v>

544
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 1>his size,</v>

545
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 1>his ability to put guys away.</v>

546
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Like what we're seeing.</v>

547
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean he puts guys away,</v>

548
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the way you're watching a movie.</v>

549
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Very like fluid athlete.</v>

550
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's doing things,</v>

551
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>everything's f shoes and he throws blooded hard fucking kicks man.</v>

552
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 1>The only x factor with him as the grappling.</v>

553
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

554
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>So he's had,</v>

555
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 1>so Derek's had four more wins.</v>

556
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>He beat Gavriel Gunza Gabriel Gonzaga.</v>

557
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>He beat a Grabowski and he'd beat up Victor Becka before he fought.</v>

558
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Nelson looks good man.</v>

559
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 1>He looks real good dude.</v>

560
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Real good for or fight win streak and getting wins over Gonzaga Nelson.</v>

561
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad.</v>

562
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Remember that fight was Shawn Jordan too,</v>

563
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 1>but I think Shawn Jordan Hook kicked him in the head.</v>

564
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah did.</v>

565
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

566
00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that a short time anybody has ever,</v>

567
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and he's a huge guy,</v>

568
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 1>but the first time anybody ever like hey owed somebody with a hook kick.</v>

569
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:52.364
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

570
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Did he change your like you did maybe.</v>

571
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

572
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Great guy though.</v>

573
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:57.981
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice.</v>

574
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Calm like and he was,</v>

575
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.490
<v Speaker 1>he's short for heavyweight man.</v>

576
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>A large man.</v>

577
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a tank though.</v>

578
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.850
<v Speaker 1>What does he play?</v>

579
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.261
<v Speaker 1>Football.</v>

580
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Lsu Full back on the national championship.</v>

581
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.021

654
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be guys who figured out how to push them off.</v>

655
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be more defensive.</v>

656
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 1>These guys are forced to engage with them.</v>

657
00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

658
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be guys that are not gonna wanna engage at all.</v>

659
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to have much more distance.</v>

660
00:18:25.331 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 1>They're doing are going to be easy to take down.</v>

736
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:43.621
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

737
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>say he does get down to two 65 and then he starts fighting and MMA and if he's</v>

738
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:51.630

<v Speaker 1>This one sending out the Brian Signal.</v>

871
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I just forgot what the fuck I was going to ask you guys about.</v>

872
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.780
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about Rico in the Russian doorbell.</v>

873
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to talk about the Russian doping program because they almost pulled the</v>

874
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 1>entire Russian team out of the Olympic because the government was in on it.</v>

875
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.570
<v Speaker 1>But I got,</v>

876
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I got a great Russian doping story.</v>

877
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.800
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

878
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.633
<v Speaker 1>we'll wait on it.</v>

879
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole fight going on.</v>

880
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 1>We're not even pay attention.</v>

881
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see any campaign is not,</v>

882
00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I've been balls deep in this Russian.</v>

883
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen one fucking ounce of this bite back to this fight real quick,</v>

884
00:24:58.911 --> 00:24:59.990
<v Speaker 1>unless you guys got more shit.</v>

885
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 1>But you were talking about a new rule change about tight,</v>

886
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>tighter clothes and like,</v>

887
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:03.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

888
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:04.230
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

889
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I,</v>

890
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I might have read it wrong.</v>

891
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure I get it right,</v>

892
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that one of the new rule changes is no loose clothing for female</v>

893
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

894
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.813
<v Speaker 1>It's been a problem.</v>

895
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.553
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

896
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 1>You would think that,</v>

897
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.070
<v Speaker 1>we gotta stop them.</v>

899
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>How do they like doing changes to six elbows might've happened once or twice.</v>

900
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

901
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 1>They know they change all these rules,</v>

902
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:24.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

903
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

904
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 1>the sanctioning body changed a bunch of rules like,</v>

905
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

906
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.390
<v Speaker 1>what wins around 10,</v>

907
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:29.841
<v Speaker 1>eight round,</v>

908
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:30.674
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

909
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.161
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

910
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:31.551
<v Speaker 1>sweet.</v>

911
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:32.061
<v Speaker 1>I bet they do.</v>

912
00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 1>12 to six elbows.</v>

913
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

914
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:34.311
<v Speaker 1>they should have done that.</v>

915
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:35.031
<v Speaker 1>But what they did do,</v>

916
00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>that's even more interesting honestly,</v>

917
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>

918
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 1>this new rule about putting your hands down the mat.</v>

919
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to have both your hands flat on the Mat,</v>

920
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>both hands to constitute being in a position where you can't get kicked her</v>

921
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:48.494
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

922
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.383
<v Speaker 1>That's better.</v>

923
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

924
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 1>that's way better because it makes it less of a fucking gay man.</v>

925
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.041
<v Speaker 1>Real Shit.</v>

926
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

927
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the beginning of just crushing that altogether.</v>

928
00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:58.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

929
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be crushed because we have to be honest about what the sport is.</v>

930
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

931
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 1>And there's a sport of fighting and if you take away some really super effective</v>

932
00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:09.164
<v Speaker 1>maneuvers,</v>

933
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but you leave in a bunch of other super effective maneuvers,</v>

934
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 1>like we got to be consistent and we're not consistent.</v>

935
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And there's a position where you can be kind of safe when you have your hand on</v>

936
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 1>the mat and you can't be needing the face.</v>

937
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>He can't be kicked in the face,</v>

938
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 1>but that causes like safety first kind of behavior,</v>

939
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but also guys are taking advantage of it.</v>

940
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So higher game,</v>

941
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.280
<v Speaker 1>it's super unrealistic.</v>

942
00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Gone from this point on.</v>

943
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck,</v>

944
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.350
<v Speaker 1>it's super unrealistic,</v>

945
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

946
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

947
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.250
<v Speaker 1>And then there are also a,</v>

948
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 1>they're putting more emphasis on 10,</v>

949
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:37.101
<v Speaker 1>eight rounds.</v>

950
00:26:37.101 --> 00:26:38.360
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna see more frequently,</v>

951
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:38.571
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

952
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:39.260
<v Speaker 1>eight rounds now,</v>

953
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:39.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:39.681
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

955
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:39.971
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>

956
00:26:39.971 --> 00:26:42.330
<v Speaker 1>what if they decided to not fucking finally,</v>

957
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 1>that's way better.</v>

958
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Way Better.</v>

959
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 1>12 to six elbows.</v>

960
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:45.391
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

961
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the one thing I went through the list.</v>

962
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

963
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do they know how to address that?</v>

964
00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

965
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 1>But they did allow this new rule,</v>

966
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>the hands on the mat rule.</v>

967
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I think soon to be more,</v>

968
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:55.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

969
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be more of a factor than even the 12 to six elbow.</v>

970
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very smart that they did it because I think you can still protect</v>

971
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:04.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself in those positions.</v>

972
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

973
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:04.771
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

974
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about someone who's trying to make their way back up to their</v>

975
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 1>feet and ideally to strike or to grapple again,</v>

976
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a transitionary period.</v>

977
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:12.811
<v Speaker 1>So to say,</v>

978
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 1>this guy can't kick you in a transitionary moving period.</v>

979
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:16.351
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

980
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:16.981
<v Speaker 1>It's very stupid.</v>

981
00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

982
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

983
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 1>they also changed a open hand policy.</v>

984
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.590
<v Speaker 1>You Know Jon Jones and trash brown.</v>

985
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.070
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

986
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you open it,</v>

987
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.970
<v Speaker 1>they're going to warn you and then I take a point.</v>

988
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're fighting with open hands,</v>

989
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have some issues that smart.</v>

990
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I think they should change.</v>

991
00:27:28.831 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 1>The gloves are really do I think should be bad and pride.</v>

992
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I think they can go back to pride gloves.</v>

993
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to be a,</v>

994
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at the amount of,</v>

995
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I pokes in pride versus the amount of Ipos in the UFC.</v>

996
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>

997
00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:42.760
<v Speaker 1>That's because those guys are so juiced up.</v>

998
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 1>If you hit their eyes,</v>

999
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:44.634
<v Speaker 1>they didn't give a fuck.</v>

1000
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1001
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:46.880
<v Speaker 1>it was like sharps.</v>

1002
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't care what the rule.</v>

1003
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I would like change as well,</v>

1004
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 1>and this sounds brutal,</v>

1005
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:54.870
<v Speaker 1>but when you have someone's back,</v>

1006
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to elbow him in the back of the fucking head.</v>

1007
00:27:56.851 --> 00:28:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Why can't can you can front of the head that's so intense.</v>

1008
00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:01.904
<v Speaker 1>In the front,</v>

1009
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the back of the heads to no,</v>

1010
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:03.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1011
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:03.561
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1012
00:28:03.561 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1013
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 1>It's to tap quick.</v>

1014
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1015
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>back in the day when that shit was legal,</v>

1016
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you didn't even have to have a good rear naked choke.</v>

1017
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You put your own,</v>

1018
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you get on their back,</v>

1019
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you throw a couple of these and we're tapping quick,</v>

1020
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:15.211
<v Speaker 1>different game.</v>

1021
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Now my man,</v>

1022
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't have that back to the lab.</v>

1023
00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 1>You could had kicked someone with your Shin,</v>

1024
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.913
<v Speaker 1>but here's the,</v>

1025
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I kick them in the eyes,</v>

1026
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but not just no,</v>

1027
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.470
<v Speaker 1>but you can't kick him in the back of the head.</v>

1028
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's weird transition.</v>

1029
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 1>When you're fighting,</v>

1030
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:32.580
<v Speaker 1>you're standing up.</v>

1031
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 1>If you throw a head kick and you hit a guy in the back of the head and he goes</v>

1032
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:35.940
<v Speaker 1>to sleep,</v>

1033
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't get penalized at all.</v>

1034
00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You won by knockout every single time.</v>

1035
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

1036
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.770
<v Speaker 1>brutal sport.</v>

1037
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Almost always when they throw high kicks,</v>

1038
00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:44.394
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>

1039
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.030
<v Speaker 1>especially if like it goes like over the left shoulder safety,</v>

1040
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 1>both sand an orthodox and you throw a right high kick and it goes over the left</v>

1041
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 1>shoulder,</v>

1042
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.210
<v Speaker 1>the first place it's hitting as the back of your head a lot with it wraps around</v>

1043
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:59.211
<v Speaker 1>to imagine what everyone's records would look like in the history of MMA.</v>

1044
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.810
<v Speaker 1>If that was never taken out and you'd been,</v>

1045
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 1>there would have been a lot of wins and losses switched up.</v>

1046
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1047
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.300
<v Speaker 1>People forget that in the beginning when you'd get the back,</v>

1048
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.820
<v Speaker 1>he's getting naked.</v>

1049
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.773
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

1050
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You just ride the duty,</v>

1051
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you fuck them up and they tap.</v>

1052
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather see knees to a down opponent.</v>

1053
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Is it was the guy saying,</v>

1054
00:29:17.621 --> 00:29:18.331
<v Speaker 1>what's the big deal?</v>

1055
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it Ben Spiker versus Henzel Gracie?</v>

1056
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Is that who it was?</v>

1057
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And it was a judo guy and I remember John Lewis did it to somebody and the</v>

1058
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.480
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>

1059
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.313
<v Speaker 1>John Lewis,</v>

1060
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.521
<v Speaker 1>the guy tapped him,</v>

1061
00:29:30.521 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 1>was fucking over.</v>

1062
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.870
<v Speaker 1>That was done back of the head.</v>

1063
00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:33.301
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

1064
00:29:33.301 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Eddy with the elbows,</v>

1065
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1066
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1067
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.550
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it really effective?</v>

1068
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Explain how you people are getting kicked in the back of that and no one's</v>

1069
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:41.580
<v Speaker 1>complaining about excuse.</v>

1070
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.490
<v Speaker 1>You can control it.</v>

1071
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 1>If you kick,</v>

1072
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:43.940
<v Speaker 1>you can control that.</v>

1073
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>If you throw a head kick and she goes over the shoulder,</v>

1074
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 1>lands with the instep,</v>

1075
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.560
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always hitting the back of that.</v>

1076
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.901
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1077
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:50.490
<v Speaker 1>But same thing,</v>

1078
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're throwing a huge right hand,</v>

1079
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:53.420
<v Speaker 1>the guy goes to slip back of the head,</v>

1080
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference.</v>

1081
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't control that.</v>

1082
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't control for game.</v>

1083
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's on purpose or an [inaudible].</v>

1084
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.070
<v Speaker 1>We just saw a guy get hit happens it guy,</v>

1085
00:30:03.071 --> 00:30:04.750
<v Speaker 1>it was just exactly what we were looking at.</v>

1086
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Someone did a cartwheel kick and kick the back of someone's head.</v>

1087
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1088
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Speaker 1>he did a cartwheel kick and it's not intentional,</v>

1089
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but that back of the head gets hit all the time with kicks gets hit with wheel</v>

1090
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:16.414
<v Speaker 1>kicks to</v>

1091
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.920
<v Speaker 1>what if you add,</v>

1092
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1093
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

1094
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Hit it with a hard impact.</v>

1095
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.320
<v Speaker 1>One of those kicks that you're talking about or when you're riding on someone's</v>

1096
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:27.490
<v Speaker 1>back and you're throwing an elbow,</v>

1097
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 1>those aren't nearly as hard as the head kicks there.</v>

1098
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Not nearly as hard as her way on her stationary and you're really stuck dudes.</v>

1099
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>But really they should come gel up and they should.</v>

1100
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.950
<v Speaker 1>You got to realize they can't just sit in that position and defend the choke.</v>

1101
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.373
<v Speaker 1>No guys,</v>

1102
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 1>guys are punching away anyways.</v>

1103
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at,</v>

1104
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.670
<v Speaker 1>you look at a cane,</v>

1105
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Travis Browne,</v>

1106
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Cain just punches.</v>

1107
00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 1>They're going to stop the fight when they get back there.</v>

1108
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Guys really aren't going for the choke and let's sort of Jujitsu based.</v>

1109
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.533
<v Speaker 1>they're really just rain down.</v>

1111
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a big fucking difference between punching someone in the back of the</v>

1112
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 1>head on the band and then Jack is Elvin,</v>

1113
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:03.790
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have so much fun last smash.</v>

1114
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to tap unless you're rumble Johnson Rumble Johnson to brutal</v>

1115
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.300
<v Speaker 1>leap when he had his back in that same way.</v>

1116
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1117
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy hits so God damn hard,</v>

1118
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.940
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sort of shame Carlin Eddie in a lot of ways.</v>

1119
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

1120
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean we should really consider it like it is a very effective technique.</v>

1121
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.310
<v Speaker 1>The real question is like how dangerous is it?</v>

1122
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Why is it more dangerous?</v>

1123
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's cause the brainstem is there.</v>

1124
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 1>There's not as much for and pulling back the brainstem.</v>

1125
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.913
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1126
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 1>well it seems that that is an area that's vulnerable.</v>

1127
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Much like your eyeballs,</v>

1128
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 1>much like your temple.</v>

1129
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are vulnerable areas and it's weird,</v>

1130
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 1>real weird to me that we take like even if it's the most vulnerable one,</v>

1131
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 1>why are we taking that spot and not really taking it out of the game either.</v>

1132
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Like you can still hit guys there with head kicks and you did.</v>

1133
00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Why not just get guys in the dental thing?</v>

1134
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.440
<v Speaker 1>If you want to end the fight,</v>

1135
00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 1>just forget the cup.</v>

1136
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's just start kicking the Dick.</v>

1137
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it a real fuck.</v>

1138
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.603
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1139
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.560
<v Speaker 1>You stop right there.</v>

1140
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 1>You stop at the Watson Man.</v>

1141
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good question.</v>

1142
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>It is a good question.</v>

1143
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:14.711
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1144
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question because honestly,</v>

1145
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the early UFC,</v>

1146
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.240
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of Dick fucking kick in.</v>

1147
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Keith Hackney and Joe Sawn Buck Yas Hackney's inside control</v>

1148
00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 1>drop him bombs on Joe Sons',</v>

1149
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Dick</v>

1150
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1151
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.413
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

1152
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 1>A big difference.</v>

1153

1166
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 2>he turned us nuts second that peanut butter.</v>

1167
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.083
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

1168
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.400
<v Speaker 2>That's unacceptable.</v>

1169
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:08.234
<v Speaker 2>The back of the head.</v>

1170
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.420
<v Speaker 2>So how,</v>

1171
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:11.130
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1172
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.930
<v Speaker 2>how do you not understand the difference between your Johnson and the back of</v>

1173
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:15.320
<v Speaker 2>your head?</v>

1174
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:15.771
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel?</v>

1175
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably get kicked in the fucking Johnson in the back of my brain.</v>

1176
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1180
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.000

1182
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I let them kick my head.</v>

1183
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1184
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:35.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1185
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 2>pick your poison.</v>

1186
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.543
<v Speaker 2>Both aren't,</v>

1187
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1188
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320
<v Speaker 2>If he kicks you in the head,</v>

1189
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:43.220
<v Speaker 2>your Dick might never work for him or you won't remember fucking again.</v>

1190
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.830
<v Speaker 2>He would choose the Dick over the back of the head.</v>

1191
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent.</v>

1192
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.443
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1193
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1194
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.093

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the back of the head.</v>

1196
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.621
<v Speaker 2>The head.</v>

1197
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna remember doing shit.</v>

1198
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.100
<v Speaker 2>She could uh,</v>

1199
00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Speaker 2>potentially can die.</v>

1200
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Die from being kicked in the Dick.</v>

1201
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 2>It depends on like where is he kicking you in the Dick.</v>

1202
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>What if he kicks you like across the,</v>

1203
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.920
<v Speaker 2>the like if your Dick is like kicks you like the Shin across the top.</v>

1204
00:34:12.811 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Bring it.</v>

1205
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I say bring it.</v>

1206
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>You know you might be able to deal with that.</v>

1207
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to smash your Dick down a little bit and then let it go.</v>

1208
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 2>The trunk.</v>

1209
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:20.750

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>selling it or this is what I know they're selling it and Dana stays on.</v>

1345
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 1>he's still the president and the Fertittas are no longer involved in it at all.</v>

1346
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.850
<v Speaker 1>There's different guys and all,</v>

1347
00:37:23.851 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 1>if there's a bunch of people involved now,</v>

1348
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but nothing changes really.</v>

1349
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1350
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:27.691
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1351
00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Dana's still still,</v>

1352
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 1>he's still on board as the president.</v>

1353
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1354
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>He's somehow to make all the decisions,</v>

1355
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:32.943
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1356
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know as much power.</v>

1362
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:40.430
<v Speaker 1>but for one franker out done.</v>

1370
00:37:55.861 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 1>what they call it.</v>

1371
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>If it's a new organization that's bought the UFC,</v>

1372
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works if they just came together and formed the new</v>

1373
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.003
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>

1378
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 1>we owe the Fertittas everything.</v>

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

1381
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1382
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.860
<v Speaker 1>the risk taking an acumen.</v>

1383
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know when to stay in and when to bail and how they could turn this</v>

1384
00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:30.924
<v Speaker 1>thing around.</v>

1385
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.793
<v Speaker 1>They're brilliant.</v>

1386
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 1>They deserve,</v>

1387
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.760
<v Speaker 1>if they are with Eddie and I used to always dream of every Eddie and I when we</v>

1388
00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:39.670

<v Speaker 1>You had to get direct TV.</v>

1393
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I had direct TV specifically so I can get the UFC.</v>

1394
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 1>You need a two scrooge McDuck to go.</v>

1395
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:50.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1403
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 1>smart promotional decisions,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1488
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.510
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that I'd never bought it.</v>

1489
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I was real close.</v>

1490
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1491
00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1492
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I had to make sure that I was thinking about it correctly.</v>

1493
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:18.931
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1494
00:41:18.931 --> 00:41:22.190
<v Speaker 1>I really had to spend time thinking about what I was doing.</v>

1495
00:41:22.191 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I definitely knew that I had a reduced the schedule that was a,</v>

1496
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 1>there was no way I was going to go back to doing as many times as I was doing it</v>

1497
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:28.621
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1498
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:29.454
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1499
00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's good for you,</v>

1500
00:41:31.111 --> 00:41:31.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1501
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think flying that much is good for you.</v>

1502
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1503
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1504
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not nothing.</v>

1505
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:35.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1506
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 1>we're not made to be in there.</v>

1507
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And anything that recycled air and shit flying every week.</v>

1508
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1509
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 1>road guys like comics too.</v>

1510
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.630
<v Speaker 1>They have this look about them.</v>

1511
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:45.464
<v Speaker 1>They look like shit.</v>

1512
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 1>They look weary.</v>

1513
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1514
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think it's good for you and by the way,</v>

1515
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1516
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about radiation and space.</v>

1517
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure.</v>

1518
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I'm an expert.</v>

1519
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is radiation though,</v>

1520
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:56.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1521
00:41:56.241 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 1>When you go up in space,</v>

1522
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably worse,</v>

1523
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.563
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1524
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I think I read that it's more radiation than you get when you get an x ray every</v>

1525
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.481
<v Speaker 1>time you get to plan.</v>

1526
00:42:04.481 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1527
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1528
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.201
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if that's true.</v>

1529
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 1>It might've made that up and then you're on the plane for what,</v>

1530
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.330
<v Speaker 1>12 hours?</v>

1531
00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.470
<v Speaker 1>14 hours on time.</v>

1532
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.241
<v Speaker 1>I just went to Italy.</v>

1533
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1534
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that was at least keep that shit.</v>

1535
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't fly along the five hours,</v>

1536
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.063
<v Speaker 1>five hours,</v>

1537
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's in Italy.</v>

1538
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.021
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

1539
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It's worth getting a little radiated.</v>

1540
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:20.443
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1541
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't think so?</v>

1542
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:22.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1543
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it real now.</v>

1544
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 1>What did you go through?</v>

1545
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Do we have great Italian food and security line?</v>

1546
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:28.904
<v Speaker 1>Do you opt out,</v>

1547
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but do you opt out in the security line?</v>

1548
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:31.571

1554
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1555
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:42.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1556
00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:43.484
<v Speaker 1>you can opt out,</v>

1557
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.260

<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1559
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing how they're allowed to touch your Dick.</v>

1560
00:42:51.411 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's with the back of the hand they tell you.</v>

1561
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:53.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1562
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 1>cause we're going to have to check on my hand.</v>

1563
00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'm going to hit your sensitive areas.</v>

1564
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:58.094
<v Speaker 1>Is that cool?</v>

1565
00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

1566
00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's the back of the hands.</v>

1567
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

1568
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.323
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1569
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 1>There's less nerves on the back of your hand.</v>

1570
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel good?</v>

1571
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.133
<v Speaker 1>It's not</v>

1572
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:11.361
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>

1573
00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:12.260
<v Speaker 1>it's the back of my head.</v>

1574
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:12.951
<v Speaker 1>If I did this,</v>

1575
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:14.460
<v Speaker 1>that now it's up now.</v>

1576
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:15.603
<v Speaker 1>Well there you go.</v>

1577
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Risk on a flight as small as cosmic rays sound scary,</v>

1578
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but radiation risk on a flight as small.</v>

1579
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.530
<v Speaker 1>See if that was right about you get as much as you get when you get x Ray.</v>

1580
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 1>See if that's correct.</v>

1581
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That might be total bullshit.</v>

1582
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is pilots and the flight attendants or get twice the incidence of</v>

1583
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 1>melanoma compared to general population,</v>

1606
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo p case in point,</v>

1611
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:18.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1612
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.140
<v Speaker 1>You have that shit on Fox son,</v>

1613
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:20.491
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1614
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:20.871
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1615
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

1616
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Saved the back of the head.</v>

1617
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.370
<v Speaker 1>But wouldn't it be a position where you would have to protect that?</v>

1618
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:26.743
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1619
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:27.231
<v Speaker 1>no cup.</v>

1620
00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.030
<v Speaker 1>How about you just fucking,</v>

1621
00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:30.050
<v Speaker 1>he'll kick him in the nuts.</v>

1622
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 1>How seriously,</v>

1623
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:32.730
<v Speaker 1>how come it's okay to,</v>

1624
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:35.320
<v Speaker 1>he'll kick a guy in the temple because you didn't say,</v>

1625
00:44:35.321 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 1>well the elbow guy,</v>

1626
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the guy could have his head sideways and you could smash down the point of your</v>

1627
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 1>elbow into his temple and that's illegal strike because I think with the</v>

1628
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:46.440
<v Speaker 1>brainstem and you don't have as much protection back here.</v>

1629
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.343
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1630
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.941
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1631
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Well sits like the connections,</v>

1632
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.330
<v Speaker 1>the critical connection to the brain.</v>

1633
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1634
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:52.943
<v Speaker 1>The fight would be over.</v>

1635
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1636
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like what,</v>

1637
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously it's dangerous to get hit anywhere in the head,</v>

1638
00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder like how much more dangerous it is a bit to you.</v>

1639
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.243
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1640
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:06.280
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1641
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It's already happening all the time.</v>

1642
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.080
<v Speaker 1>What's your on promoting it?</v>

1643
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.531
<v Speaker 1>No one's,</v>

1644
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:11.460
<v Speaker 1>no one's promoting it,</v>

1645
00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but we're not,</v>

1646
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.010
<v Speaker 1>we're not changing the result of a fight.</v>

1647
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.250
<v Speaker 1>If somebody wheel kicks a guy and clips the back of his head,</v>

1648
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 1>if he says shit happens all the time.</v>

1649
00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1650
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it's almost that serious.</v>

1651
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 1>They should like Dq,</v>

1652
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the guy for those head kicks and they,</v>

1653
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 1>if they do the replay,</v>

1654
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the instant replay that goes,</v>

1655
00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:27.544
<v Speaker 1>you know what you lost.</v>

1656
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see a Ernesto hoost versus a Maury Smith God forever ago.</v>

1657
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.320

1658
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:34.860

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.413
<v Speaker 1>This is um,</v>

1661
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.410
<v Speaker 1>this is like a classic example of a behind the head head kick.</v>

1662
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

1670
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.610

1673
00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's right on the back of them.</v>

1674
00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1675
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean absolutely perfectly.</v>

1676
00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 1>This is exchange,</v>

1677
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:04.830
<v Speaker 1>but look how good who's two is,</v>

1678
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 1>check this exchange out in the middle of it blocks the knee and Kinda hip</v>

1679
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.491
<v Speaker 1>dexterity.</v>

1680
00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:11.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1681
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 1>he's always done a full split.</v>

1682
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Well look how he comes back down.</v>

1683
00:46:14.941 --> 00:46:15.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1684
00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:16.104
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

1685
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:16.801
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1686
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:17.090
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>

1687
00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 1>look at this distance though.</v>

1688
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Me and check.</v>

1689
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.263
<v Speaker 1>Check this.</v>

1690
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Uhmm I mean that is just artwork or was it over the top of the shoulder?</v>

1691
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the correct reaction.</v>

1692
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Your opponent throws a knee.</v>

1693
00:46:29.891 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 1>You know that you got time,</v>

1694
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no way he's going to get that neat back.</v>

1695
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 1>He just timing the movement and like a guy like Anderson,</v>

1696
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:38.970
<v Speaker 1>like he would time like when,</v>

1697
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.301
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1698
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>when you would put your feet down when you would,</v>

1699
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:41.820
<v Speaker 1>when you would mill.</v>

1700
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 1>So he knows that if you're doing this,</v>

1701
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you're going here and then maybe you have a pattern.</v>

1702
00:46:46.891 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have something to do afterwards.</v>

1703
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you stay in the pocket and grab,</v>

1704
00:46:49.771 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe you back up.</v>

1705
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.710
<v Speaker 1>But he just timed it perfect.</v>

1706
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:55.620
<v Speaker 1>As soon as that knee came down he had a feeling more east would be there.</v>

1707
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was just on that kick 10,000 times too.</v>

1708
00:46:58.161 --> 00:46:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1709
00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And the way brought it around behind his shoulder but from that so hard crazy</v>

1710
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.610
<v Speaker 1>thing there is from that distance is fucking nuts.</v>

1711
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.001
<v Speaker 1>They'll do,</v>

1712
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1713
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 1>like uppercut.</v>

1714
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1715
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>

1716
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And he can't catch it head and is the,</v>

1717
00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 1>the flexibility of the hips as what you really have to have.</v>

1718
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause you've got to have that ability to drop down over God.</v>

1719
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:17.521
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

1720
00:47:17.521 --> 00:47:18.031
<v Speaker 1>that was beautiful.</v>

1721
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:18.864
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>

1722
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Fucking clip.</v>

1723
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And he's such a beast.</v>

1724
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:22.111
<v Speaker 1>Ernesto,</v>

1725
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:24.690
<v Speaker 1>who's was so I sat him.</v>

1726
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:25.524
<v Speaker 1>Bob Sapp.</v>

1727

<v Speaker 1>he's gotten like really into being healthy,</v>

1886
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Joey's sound out like five shows before he even gets into town.</v>

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy for that guy.</v>

1892
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so happy.</v>

1893
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:21.344
<v Speaker 1>I know him.</v>

1894
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.140
<v Speaker 1>His jujitsu story of how he got into it is very,</v>

1895
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 1>the most inspirational digit two story ever.</v>

1896
00:51:27.681 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1897

1902
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and following,</v>

1903
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.153
<v Speaker 1>following him around,</v>

1904
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.930

1907
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 1>That's so inspirational.</v>

1908
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 1>His story.</v>

1909
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.613
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1911
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to that story and you don't want to do Jujitsu,</v>

1912
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:49.010
<v Speaker 1>you need a psychiatric evaluation.</v>

1913
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 1>This is a good fight,</v>

1914
00:51:50.481 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1915
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.950
<v Speaker 1>We're missing a good fight.</v>

1916
00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1917
00:51:54.191 --> 00:51:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I agree man.</v>

1918
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1919
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:56.223
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1920
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.320
<v Speaker 1>kind of Jujitsu has that effect on people,</v>

1921
00:51:59.321 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 1>so it's a really exciting,</v>

1922
00:52:01.421 --> 00:52:02.830
<v Speaker 1>fun thing to do.</v>

1923
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing me?</v>

1924
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Their buddy?</v>

1925
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Is that Japanese necktie?</v>

1926
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1927
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:09.613
<v Speaker 1>I can't see.</v>

1928
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1929
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 1>it looks a like a Doris.</v>

1930
00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Let me see it again.</v>

1931
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:13.743
<v Speaker 1>It looked like a,</v>

1932
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:14.890
<v Speaker 1>like a guilt.</v>

1933
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 1>You gotta take it from the top,</v>

1934
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:16.761
<v Speaker 1>go back,</v>

1935
00:52:16.761 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 1>go back,</v>

1936
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:17.900
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>

1937
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:18.950
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like it.</v>

1938
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1939
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:20.474
<v Speaker 1>not as is,</v>

1940
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like a guillotine type doors,</v>

1941
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.403
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1942
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:28.940
<v Speaker 1>The body.</v>

1943
00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1944
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.680
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing with his body is he's placing it in the exact same place as you</v>

1945
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:35.080
<v Speaker 1>would with the Japanese necktie.</v>

1946
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Just his grip is different.</v>

1947
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1948
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a Japanese necktie with a different grip but similar.</v>

1949
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like a guillotine.</v>

1950
00:52:41.601 --> 00:52:42.331
<v Speaker 1>Japanese men.</v>

1951
00:52:42.331 --> 00:52:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1952
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It's in between and Jamie for all the people that are listening,</v>

1953
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 1>what was that fight that we were just watching them and just talking about some</v>

1954
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 1>retarded and I couldn't tell by that name or something.</v>

1955
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a Japanese necktie.</v>

1956
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Say it one more time,</v>

1957
00:52:54.891 --> 00:52:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1958
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I was pulled out and you can look and read them.</v>

1959
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 1>We'll say it one more time anyway.</v>

1960
00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a Japanese name.</v>

1961
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Talk to me.</v>

1962
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at his placement of his left elbow.</v>

1963
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1964
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:03.771
<v Speaker 1>his left shoulder.</v>

1965
00:53:03.771 --> 00:53:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Those way down.</v>

1966
00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.890
<v Speaker 1>See how far down his left shoulder,</v>

1967
00:53:06.891 --> 00:53:07.690
<v Speaker 1>his and his,</v>

1968
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:08.950
<v Speaker 1>his perfect dickheads.</v>

1969
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly locked in.</v>

1970
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Go back.</v>

1971
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Go back.</v>

1972
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.501
<v Speaker 1>Here it is again.</v>

1973
00:53:12.501 --> 00:53:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

1974
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You're saying this,</v>

1975
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.390
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese necktie.</v>

1976
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1977
00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1978
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1979
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1980
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It's close.</v>

1981
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like in between and between a guillotine and the Japanese actor.</v>

1982
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 1>He might have his own version of his work.</v>

1983
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:23.763
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1984
00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite the same,</v>

1985
00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's still the fact that you could see his hands in the front.</v>

1986
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.500
<v Speaker 1>It has got to stay in the back of the form of guilt.</v>

1987
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1988
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it interesting though that there's like a lot of different ways to</v>

1989
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 1>grip the guillotine?</v>

1990
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1991
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different ways to hold your hand,</v>

1992
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:37.883
<v Speaker 1>but they're all,</v>

1993
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 1>they're all considered gay teens but this choke,</v>

1994
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 1>which is like pretty similar,</v>

1995
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:43.410
<v Speaker 1>like the head is trapped.</v>

1996
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's twisted,</v>

1997
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:45.840
<v Speaker 1>left shoulders down,</v>

1998
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 1>hands are coming up like this.</v>

1999
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 1>The neck is getting wrench and crank.</v>

2000
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 1>It's getting wrench and cranked in both positions.</v>

2001
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2002
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Manpower for that.</v>

2003
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It's getting cranked and [inaudible] has arm evolved because the guy got that</v>

2004
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:57.684
<v Speaker 1>under hook on you.</v>

2005
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.510
<v Speaker 1>He's got like say if I'm getting it and he's got his under hook on the left</v>

2006
00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:00.830
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

2007
00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2008
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

2009
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:05.280
<v Speaker 1>my arm is a over hooking his arm and then that's going behind his head and</v>

2010
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:06.450
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm clamping down.</v>

2011
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I clamped down with like a scissors grip,</v>

2012
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 1>but that guy looked like he had like something like this.</v>

2013
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It was like almost like a gable grip right out on.</v>

2014
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong,</v>

2015
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't look like a Japanese Necktie,</v>

2016
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't.</v>

2017
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:19.703
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to tell what the,</v>

2018
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what it runs like an arm and guillotine,</v>

2019
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.611
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was.</v>

2020
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 1>That guy's neck was getting cranked too.</v>

2021
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just a the choke.</v>

2022
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:28.861
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2023
00:54:28.861 --> 00:54:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it was a neck crank.</v>

2024
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Real bad trap.</v>

2025
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.433
<v Speaker 1>Where the chest?</v>

2026
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.250
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>

2027
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Let me see it one more time.</v>

2028
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 1>It's super similar.</v>

2029
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Look at his right elbow.</v>

2030
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.250
<v Speaker 1>If he's doing a Japanese Necktie,</v>

2031
00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 1>his right elbow should be t rex here,</v>

2032
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but he looked like he was like that.</v>

2033
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2034
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he just has a wide open way of doing it.</v>

2035
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Can we see it again Jamie?</v>

2036
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just not the best way to do it.</v>

2037
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.311
<v Speaker 1>Mother Fucker,</v>

2038
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:51.170
<v Speaker 1>her Amy do.</v>

2039
00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to show it to him and y'all talk to him on the show.</v>

2040
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

2041
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't do this like he gets passionate about his work.</v>

2042
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.100
<v Speaker 1>This is important as Kim is calen stomping on the grapes or some shells coming.</v>

2043
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I know it's coming in my sink.</v>

2044
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:07.270
<v Speaker 1>A teenage girl,</v>

2045
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.710
<v Speaker 1>he went in there and got blueberries and cheese.</v>

2046
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:11.760
<v Speaker 1>You I'm wrong.</v>

2047
00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Are So strange.</v>

2048
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start with a light by bad ESCO.</v>

2049
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm wrong about that though.</v>

2050
00:55:19.081 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 1>The right elbow wouldn't be t rex in it because he couldn't be,</v>

2051
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:22.570
<v Speaker 1>because you have the overlook.</v>

2052
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:25.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a way it can be can be t rex cause it's got the overhead.</v>

2053
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So it is a Japanese necktie.</v>

2054
00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:26.941
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2055
00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:27.774
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to tell.</v>

2056
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 1>But he got the left shoulder down.</v>

2057
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:29.641
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2058
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:30.381
<v Speaker 1>which is where you,</v>

2059
00:55:30.381 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be necessarily there in a Doris,</v>

2060
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you would want the right shoulder down.</v>

2061
00:55:34.201 --> 00:55:34.441
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2062
00:55:34.441 --> 00:55:35.274
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2063
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So the way he's doing it is totally a Japanese necktie.</v>

2064
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it did because the head's trap the exact same way.</v>

2065
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Trap the head.</v>

2066
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 1>The neck is cranked in the exact same direction and also he's got the leg tied</v>

2067
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:46.831
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2068
00:55:46.831 --> 00:55:47.341
<v Speaker 1>which I like.</v>

2069
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I liked how he did it to how he tied up the near side leg.</v>

2070
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 1>It's for sure not a dark because his hips,</v>

2071
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 1>his shoulder always wondered gentlemen,</v>

2072
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.180
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen to fight companions.</v>

2073
00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Companions.</v>

2074
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 1>That actually answered a question that I had.</v>

2075
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at it right now and I was always like,</v>

2076
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 1>what's the best leg to tie up?</v>

2077
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause I would always tie up whatever legacy matter.</v>

2078
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.121
<v Speaker 1>I always said that.</v>

2079
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at that,</v>

2080
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:11.610
<v Speaker 1>if he ties up the left leg,</v>

2081
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.110
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have that.</v>

2082
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:15.540
<v Speaker 1>He can't move with that right leg.</v>

2083
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Or excuse me if he ties up the right leg,</v>

2084
00:56:17.581 --> 00:56:18.011
<v Speaker 1>the way he's got it,</v>

2085
00:56:18.011 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 1>like there,</v>

2086
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.141
<v Speaker 1>he can't,</v>

2087
00:56:19.141 --> 00:56:20.520
<v Speaker 1>that other legs aren't helping them as much.</v>

2088
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:20.821
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2089
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 1>If he ties up the other leg,</v>

2090
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 1>then he can get that right leg under him and he can use it to manipulate.</v>

2091
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Is Russia more pressures is he wasn't using.</v>

2092
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 1>He immediately,</v>

2093
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Shit stomped on dudes.</v>

2094
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Right thigh with his left foot and that's how you escape you.</v>

2095
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 1>You'd get your leg out and spin.</v>

2096
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You got to get,</v>

2097
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.380
<v Speaker 1>if you can get that leg free,</v>

2098
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

2099
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:42.341
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2100
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>

2101
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.870
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2102
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 1>look how he has his legs.</v>

2103
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.820
<v Speaker 1>He's got to kick his leg free.</v>

2104
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 1>He's got to kick it free or you're done.</v>

2105
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing you gotta do this.</v>

2106
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.140
<v Speaker 1>You would kick it.</v>

2107
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 1>He would kick out the right leg.</v>

2108
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2109
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:52.583
<v Speaker 1>Push it away.</v>

2110
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:53.620
<v Speaker 1>The leg that's caught.</v>

2111
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Use your free leg.</v>

2112
00:56:54.561 --> 00:56:55.331
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a leg lock.</v>

2113
00:56:55.331 --> 00:56:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Someone's attacking that leg.</v>

2114
00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Kick it free.</v>

2115
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:57.940
<v Speaker 1>But here's a question.</v>

2116
00:56:57.970 --> 00:56:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's a real good question.</v>

2117
00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:01.630
<v Speaker 1>If you were in a position like that or somewhere similar,</v>

2118
00:57:01.631 --> 00:57:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and will you have access to kick the knee?</v>

2119
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Can you kick someone's knee on the ground when you're grappling with it?</v>

2120
00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2121
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.350
<v Speaker 1>How come no one's ever done that?</v>

2122
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.780
<v Speaker 1>No one's like attack the knee.</v>

2123
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's ever been in a position.</v>

2124
00:57:15.521 --> 00:57:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe they have site control or something like that and they'd drop acts</v>

2125
00:57:18.281 --> 00:57:19.570
<v Speaker 1>kicks down on someone's knee,</v>

2126
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 1>just attack their knee from there.</v>

2127
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.773
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to see it,</v>

2128
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 1>but it feels like you should be able to definitely attack the thighs.</v>

2129
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>

2130
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you're saying in a grappling tournament like,</v>

2131
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:28.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2132
00:57:28.031 --> 00:57:28.151
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2133
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:28.481
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2134
00:57:28.481 --> 00:57:28.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2135
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:28.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2136
00:57:28.991 --> 00:57:29.111
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2137
00:57:29.111 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 1>In a grappling position,</v>

2138
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:33.520
<v Speaker 1>someone who has someone in but does it,</v>

2139
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:34.363
<v Speaker 1>you ever see it?</v>

2140
00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:36.423
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2141
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that'll fuck up your balance,</v>

2142
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2143
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:41.731
<v Speaker 1>but in that guy,</v>

2144
00:57:41.731 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 1>in that situation where that guy is getting choked,</v>

2145
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:45.790
<v Speaker 1>if he could have kicked,</v>

2146
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 1>if he kicked at the knee itself,</v>

2147
00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:49.151
<v Speaker 1>like that would be,</v>

2148
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a good position for it.</v>

2149
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:50.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2150
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:51.300
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2151
00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.133
<v Speaker 1>can do his job.</v>

2152
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:53.640
<v Speaker 1>He's got his shit that like free.</v>

2153
00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:54.580
<v Speaker 1>He's got to kick that leg.</v>

2154
00:57:54.581 --> 00:57:55.414
<v Speaker 1>Freeing and it's,</v>

2155
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:56.021
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

2156
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess not going to exam.</v>

2157
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 1>You have flat on your back.</v>

2158
00:57:57.821 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Is there ever a time where you can kick someone's legs when you're holding them</v>

2159
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:03.214
<v Speaker 1>down</v>

2160
00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:07.403
<v Speaker 1>and pride.</v>

2161
00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 1>A good combo would be if you get them out,</v>

2162
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:10.640
<v Speaker 1>pop off,</v>

2163
00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 1>stand up stones.</v>

2164
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:12.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2165
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Walk away.</v>

2166
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:14.980
<v Speaker 1>He did that to Dan Henderson.</v>

2167
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Pop up on the mountain and you stand up.</v>

2168
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:17.501
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2169
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Like that's something you'd have to Pratt.</v>

2170
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.091
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2171
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a combo as a combo and it's so effective.</v>

2172
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:22.961
<v Speaker 1>Move.</v>

2173
00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:23.794
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2174
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.030
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2175
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Like what effective moves are legal and what are not.</v>

2176
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:29.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the most under utilized kicks,</v>

2177
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2178
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.800
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion are those,</v>

2179
00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:32.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2180
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Hixon those that a trail leg curl kicks while you have someone's back that's</v>

2181
00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:37.331
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>

2182
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it's legal.</v>

2183
00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:39.123
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

2184
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2185
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.460
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a tax to the kidney.</v>

2186
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:43.990
<v Speaker 1>They were considered a tax to the kidney.</v>

2187
00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.090
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the new revisions in this.</v>

2188
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2189
00:58:46.281 --> 00:58:46.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2190
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about from full guard.</v>

2191
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about,</v>

2192
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:49.510
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about from back mouth.</v>

2193
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.410
<v Speaker 1>You have the guys back.</v>

2194
00:58:50.411 --> 00:58:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Remember what Hickson was doing to Zulu.</v>

2195
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:52.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2196
00:58:52.461 --> 00:58:53.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2197
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Those kicks to the abdomen.</v>

2198
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:55.743
<v Speaker 1>So the abdomen,</v>

2199
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:57.070
<v Speaker 1>why aren't they doing it?</v>

2200
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't people doing that?</v>

2201
00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Who was the last guy that did write a book?</v>

2202
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel like Cole Miller did.</v>

2203
00:59:01.301 --> 00:59:02.470
<v Speaker 1>That should be normal shit.</v>

2204
00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:02.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2205
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Cole,</v>

2206
00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Cole Miller do that in front of you and then the guy's defendant and then he</v>

2207
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:08.780
<v Speaker 1>comes up and chokes exactly how you set up the jokes.</v>

2208
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.073
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

2209
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:11.963
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

2210
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.290
<v Speaker 1>budgeted Penn was now at least guys can attack when they're on their back.</v>

2211
00:59:17.291 --> 00:59:20.030
<v Speaker 1>They can kidney kick and it makes someone to bark.</v>

2212
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:21.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh beautiful.</v>

2213
00:59:21.501 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy they're making preps are very good.</v>

2214
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:25.011
<v Speaker 1>Barry shot.</v>

2215
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:25.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2216
00:59:25.151 --> 00:59:25.560
<v Speaker 1>so when you,</v>

2217
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

2218
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 1>when somebody is in your card,</v>

2219
00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:28.544
<v Speaker 1>you can do kidney,</v>

2220
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.910
<v Speaker 1>kidney kicked them rice.</v>

2221
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2222
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2223
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

2224
00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It's got to protect the kid.</v>

2225
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Well you get not going to be able to just lay there.</v>

2226
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 1>There'll be,</v>

2227
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.120
<v Speaker 1>it's another offensive option for the grappler.</v>

2228
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a full guard position and someone has good kicks,</v>

2229
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.210
<v Speaker 1>like say if you get some Anderson silver type character was good kicks,</v>

2230
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 1>he can fuck your backup man.</v>

2231
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.701
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2232
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And when you do get free,</v>

2233
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:48.411
<v Speaker 1>you break free.</v>

2234
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 1>You could be all bunched up and tightened up just from eating those heel kicks,</v>

2235
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.820
<v Speaker 1>danger there that you can actually create.</v>

2236
00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:57.020
<v Speaker 1>You can cause internal bleeding.</v>

2237
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.330
<v Speaker 1>That'll,</v>

2238
00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that'll mess with them later on.</v>

2239
00:59:58.940 --> 00:59:59.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2240
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:00.680
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a lot of internal bleeding,</v>

2241
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:01.250
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

2242
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2243
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>You're in a cage fight,</v>

2244
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.053
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2245
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.650
<v Speaker 1>We gotta stop the kidney injury.</v>

2246
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:07.071
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

2247
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>how can you say you could stop kidney injuries but you won't stop a spinning</v>

2248
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>back kick to the ribs.</v>

2249
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:12.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2250
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's one kick.</v>

2251
01:00:13.371 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was.</v>

2252
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a constitution as goes,</v>

2253
01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2254
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.431
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

2255
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>if someone like some elite guy like a,</v>

2256
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>a Wonderboy spinning back kicks you in the ribs.</v>

2257
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.651

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:26.360

2264
01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:32.990

2265
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2266

<v Speaker 1>When he fought,</v>

2272
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>when he fought Brock was Uber him too.</v>

2273
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:44.901
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

2274
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>when he was at his biggest,</v>

2275
01:00:45.831 --> 01:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>did you notice when Pilo gay take body shots like that?</v>

2276
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a pause.</v>

2277
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>There's that like they're like they go and then they fall.</v>

2278
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.611
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

2279
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>

2280
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but they say that's because your liver gets lifted up and when it falls back</v>

2281
01:00:56.991 --> 01:00:57.231
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2282
01:00:57.231 --> 01:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me that that's why there's that pause.</v>

2283
01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>So you watch guys who get hit so of you guys got watch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's anybody that takes,</v>

2286
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:03.880

2292
01:01:11.511 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2295
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.010
<v Speaker 1>One of his buddies,</v>

2296
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was,</v>

2297
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>lost a fight by getting a body shot and he'd just kind of crumbled,</v>

2298

2301
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>we do this all the time.</v>

2302
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And then showed him like that he kept doing reps like in Hin balling up into</v>

2303
01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>into garden,</v>

2304
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>bringing the guy down and your card to give you time,</v>

2305
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2306
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>is how is he suspended right now?</v>

2307
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

2309
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2310
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I know he just opened up a gym in California,</v>

2311
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2312
01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

2313
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>He tested,</v>

2314
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:43.330
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2315
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Reverse with the same thing.</v>

2316
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:44.931
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson.</v>

2317
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:45.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2318
01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:45.914
<v Speaker 1>And He tests positive.</v>

2319
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:46.903
<v Speaker 1>What was it for?</v>

2320
01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno Jamie.</v>

2321
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find that out.</v>

2322
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That fucking card though.</v>

2323
01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>There's your car to the year.</v>

2324
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>As far as number of white paper,</v>

2325
01:01:53.681 --> 01:01:54.514
<v Speaker 1>the number was</v>

2326
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2327
01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>The cards get better now cause you'd think you get new blood in there.</v>

2328
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I bet the new owners want to go.</v>

2329
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:02.084
<v Speaker 1>Let's fucking,</v>

2330
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>none of that's new blood.</v>

2331
01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:04.643
<v Speaker 1>The blood brother.</v>

2332
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>That's how new blood,</v>

2333
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean the power of you mean,</v>

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.340
<v Speaker 1>oh you only might sailing the suits.</v>

2335
01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:10.971
<v Speaker 1>They might say,</v>

2336
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:11.211
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2339
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get crazy with it or keep it the same.</v>

2340
01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

2341
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Just so much you can do.</v>

2342
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>You need a guy who loves fighting and knows fighting did it.</v>

2343
01:02:23.441 --> 01:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Usually they'll suits,</v>

2344
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

2345
01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:25.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2346
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Corporate big corporations that get involved doesn't necessarily mean that's why</v>

2347
01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Dana stayed on board.</v>

2348
01:02:30.031 --> 01:02:30.151
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking genius with fighting,</v>

2351
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:32.971
<v Speaker 1>so Joe silver,</v>

2352
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>he can't get rid of those guys and have suits who you can never,</v>

2353
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:36.931
<v Speaker 1>it would never work.</v>

2354
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>You can never have a suit run the company either.</v>

2355
01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

2356
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Dana was a complex design to a crazy place.</v>

2357
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.503
<v Speaker 1>They knows.</v>

2358
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2359
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a genius to come up with dream matchup.</v>

2360
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be an interesting fight.</v>

2361
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Average friend.</v>

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2365
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Zak Cummings,</v>

2366
01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting this upon Zenobia Yoga.</v>

2367
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Who is a beast.</v>

2368
01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Tad Cummings is a welterweight.</v>

2369
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

2370
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>That is such a big dude.</v>

2371
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:02.760

2375
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got to walk around well over 200 pounds.</v>

2376
01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an underdog in this fight.</v>

2377
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Ponds and Nobel's.</v>

2378

01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:52.434
<v Speaker 1>If Woodley,</v>

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 1>if I'm scrooge McDuck if I'm Dana,</v>

2409
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.100
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

2410
01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2411
01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:57.510
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

2412
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2413
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2414
01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>the loyal pure.</v>

2415
01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So the sport can say Wonderboy is next,</v>

2416
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:01.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2417
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.470
<v Speaker 1>We can't do that cause cell that paper,</v>

2418
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you get 300 bucks.</v>

2419
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.211
<v Speaker 1>That ain't happen.</v>

2420
01:04:05.211 --> 01:04:06.150
<v Speaker 1>And neither one's a big draw.</v>

2421
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.381
<v Speaker 1>It sucks to say,</v>

2422
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I love both those guys area.</v>

2423
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Let's just be real here.</v>

2424
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So you do the GSP fight to make Woodlea star.</v>

2425
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So he can be a paper view headliner.</v>

2426
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Let's cause he's not a headline.</v>

2427
01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's get more realistic.</v>

2428
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2429
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>if GSP actually wants to fight,</v>

2430
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:20.903
<v Speaker 1>which he does.</v>

2431
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

2432
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>He asked for the fight.</v>

2433
01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2434
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 1>if he actually wants to fight,</v>

2435
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I feel like GSP gets a free pass.</v>

2436
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.560
<v Speaker 1>He gets a free pass right to the front.</v>

2437
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:31.403
<v Speaker 1>Like Lesnar.</v>

2438
01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.181
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2439
01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:32.361
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2440
01:04:32.361 --> 01:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2441
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2442
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2443
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.961
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2444
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:34.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2445
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2446
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to let him fight for the title.</v>

2447
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:37.591
<v Speaker 1>He's George.</v>

2448
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn Saint Peters stepped away as the champion championing title.</v>

2449
01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2450
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:43.703
<v Speaker 1>that's what I feel.</v>

2451
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>So the question is does he fight now and do they,</v>

2452
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>do they fight?</v>

2453
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Does he fight Tyron or does he fight the winner of Tyron versus Wonderboy or</v>

2454
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.110
<v Speaker 1>does Wonderboy get or does rather,</v>

2455
01:04:55.111 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2456
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>does tire and get paid and he fights Nick Diaz.</v>

2457
01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:58.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2458
01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:00.860
<v Speaker 1>he get paid more if he fights nick DSD.</v>

2459
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.171
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2460
01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 1>if I was Tyron Woodley,</v>

2461
01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd be asking for the Nick Diaz fight.</v>

2462
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.191
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing,</v>

2463
01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>why he wants,</v>

2464
01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.790
<v Speaker 1>he wants to GSP or nick,</v>

2465
01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:08.621
<v Speaker 1>if he's a bigger guy,</v>

2466
01:05:08.621 --> 01:05:09.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want wonderful.</v>

2467
01:05:09.511 --> 01:05:09.860
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2468
01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I want money.</v>

2469
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You know how much stoner money is out there?</v>

2470
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Not Nick Diaz.</v>

2471
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>If I don't think the UFC maybe even realizes what they have.</v>

2472
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I think they do because they put up Nick Diaz,</v>

2473
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2474
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>they should be putting up with everything and more.</v>

2475
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2476
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:25.803
<v Speaker 1>he's the best.</v>

2477
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>All this like flying him to press conferences,</v>

2478
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>give him a pass,</v>

2479
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>give them a pass on that.</v>

2480
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what is he going to say this going to be so you're just going to annoy you.</v>

2481
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Just let them try.</v>

2482
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Let them try.</v>

2483
01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.840
<v Speaker 1>We all know what Nick Diaz is capable of real,</v>

2484
01:05:38.841 --> 01:05:39.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2485
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

2486
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It was how much press Nate Diaz is,</v>

2487
01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:42.394
<v Speaker 1>but I love it.</v>

2488
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing a lot,</v>

2489
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:44.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot of progress.</v>

2490
01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:45.221
<v Speaker 1>He's on that.</v>

2491
01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor press tours</v>

2492
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>bashes Wonderboy Thompson says he should be able to pick his next opponent.</v>

2493
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Well as Dana White,</v>

2494
01:05:53.631 --> 01:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>if we want to entertainment and you want numbers,</v>

2495
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you do GSP or or Nikki is 100% if you're appears to have the sport,</v>

2496
01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:00.430
<v Speaker 1>you do Wonderboy.</v>

2497
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2498
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100% but the bottom line is Tyron Woodley is the fucking champion.</v>

2499
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:06.401
<v Speaker 1>And when you're they champion,</v>

2500
01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you can say all the crazy shit you want that you can't take your magic.</v>

2501
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:11.194
<v Speaker 1>My opponent.</v>

2502
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2503
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to get the money.</v>

2504
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:18.030
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking triangle Wonderboy and fucking Fox sports one year on a Wednesday</v>

2505
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 1>night and you're going to shut your fucking mouth.</v>

2506
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:21.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2507
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:21.491
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2508
01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:22.324
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that.</v>

2509
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:24.250
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they can do.</v>

2510
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:28.870
<v Speaker 1>The same car GSP versus Nick Diaz and we'll do versus Wonderboy.</v>

2511
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Same car.</v>

2512
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:29.711
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

2513
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:30.131
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

2514
01:06:30.131 --> 01:06:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're him killing</v>

2515
01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.290
<v Speaker 1>versus Nick Diaz cards,</v>

2516
01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>man call.</v>

2517
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>No super cards.</v>

2518
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.871
<v Speaker 1>No listen,</v>

2519
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:38.704
<v Speaker 1>let it spread it out.</v>

2520
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that John Danaher made a post recently saying that GSP,</v>

2521
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.040
<v Speaker 1>he put it on Instagram saying that GSPS camp for the Nick Diaz fight was one of</v>

2522
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.930
<v Speaker 1>the best camps he ever had came out of it.</v>

2523
01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Injury-Free super healthy.</v>

2524
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>And then the night before the fight drank some watermelon juice that had been</v>

2525
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>sitting out for too long and got deathly ill,</v>

2526
01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:59.800
<v Speaker 1>was throwing up all night.</v>

2527
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.480
<v Speaker 1>The watermelon juice drinking.</v>

2528
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2529
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Probably something crazy bet.</v>

2530
01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And so he was,</v>

2531
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.810
<v Speaker 1>he came to that fight,</v>

2532
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>he came in a fight depleted and they devise a strategy of conserving his energy</v>

2533
01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:10.360
<v Speaker 1>and not engaging too much.</v>

2534
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2535
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And when to time is take down,</v>

2536
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:13.533
<v Speaker 1>she goes crazy.</v>

2537
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.261
<v Speaker 1>And then when the,</v>

2538
01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 1>when they came in to see the wraps,</v>

2539
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about they wrapped GSPs hands and uh,</v>

2540
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:20.703
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2541
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Ds camp wanting to see them wrap his hands.</v>

2542
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>So they had to come in and then he said that George had to like imitate this a</v>

2543
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 1>sense of vitality,</v>

2544
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2545
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2546
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.320
<v Speaker 1>cause he was like so depleted,</v>

2547
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2548
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 1>He had to like pretend he feels fucking great.</v>

2549
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I feel fucking great.</v>

2550
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:36.851
<v Speaker 1>How did it go?</v>

2551
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Kick some ass,</v>

2552
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2553
01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2554
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2555
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>pump it up.</v>

2556
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.230
<v Speaker 1>And then when they left here was like,</v>

2557
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

2558
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2559
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2560
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to do this shit myself,</v>

2561
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.980
<v Speaker 1>champ.</v>

2562
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:48.070
<v Speaker 1>But didn't make DSA that someone drugged him in that fight.</v>

2563
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if someone drug both of them,</v>

2564
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.420
<v Speaker 1>if that's what was going on?</v>

2565
01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know it was so many drug.</v>

2566
01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:55.174
<v Speaker 1>Both guys,</v>

2567
01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>some asshole.</v>

2568
01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like maybe two guys were gamblers.</v>

2569
01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Drug is bro,</v>

2570
01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>fuck gamblers.</v>

2571
01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

2572
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you something man.</v>

2573
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:07.720
<v Speaker 1>If you are around some shady degenerate gamblers and they put some money on you</v>

2574
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.900
<v Speaker 1>and they see Eddie Bravo out for the night in the town and they know that you're</v>

2575
01:08:10.901 --> 01:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be fighting someone the next day and they can drug you and jack the</v>

2576
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2577
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>If you read the book about,</v>

2578
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a book written by David Remnick about um,</v>

2579
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the fight between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston.</v>

2580
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>And in round,</v>

2581
01:08:24.681 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I think seven,</v>

2582
01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 1>they put something on Sonny Liston gloves that blinded him and he said,</v>

2583
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:31.071
<v Speaker 1>I can't see,</v>

2584
01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:31.851
<v Speaker 1>I can't see.</v>

2585
01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:32.581
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was done.</v>

2586
01:08:32.581 --> 01:08:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Dee who said kept moving.</v>

2587
01:08:33.751 --> 01:08:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Just moving.</v>

2588
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2589
01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>just keep moving and keep boxing.</v>

2590
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And it was a huge turning point.</v>

2591
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I said they put something on the gloves.</v>

2592
01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:38.933
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2593
01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>One but they did some shady shit.</v>

2594
01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>But Henry Cooper,</v>

2595
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.770
<v Speaker 1>that's a tinfoil hat.</v>

2596
01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't let anybody touch his water bottle because they thought they were</v>

2597
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:47.451
<v Speaker 1>going to poison him.</v>

2598
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:49.080
<v Speaker 1>So he had his water bottle wrapped.</v>

2599
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I sounds like he rap tape around as well.</v>

2600
01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:51.704
<v Speaker 1>I believe that</v>

2601
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>if you watch the Sonny Liston fight,</v>

2602
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:55.371
<v Speaker 1>it's clear.</v>

2603
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 1>You hear him say it in the corner.</v>

2604
01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:57.404
<v Speaker 1>I've watched the fight.</v>

2605
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:57.801
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2606
01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.660
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting one too because I'm,</v>

2607
01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:00.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2608
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson's old manager was the narrator for the fight.</v>

2609
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:05.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2610
01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson's old manager,</v>

2611
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:06.951
<v Speaker 1>he had that,</v>

2612
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:07.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2613
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish guy that died,</v>

2614
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>who was his confidant?</v>

2615
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.613
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2616
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:13.371
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

2617
01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:17.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple different guys that handled Mike Tyson after something.</v>

2618
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Jacobs,</v>

2619
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>the black Jewish guy.</v>

2620
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a white guy.</v>

2621
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:21.283
<v Speaker 1>It was something,</v>

2622
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:22.570
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>

2623
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:27.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a Kevin Rooney something Jacobs and that was like the whole crew that was</v>

2624
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 1>leftover.</v>

2625
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:28.971
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2626
01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 1>this guy was the,</v>

2627
01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:29.961
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2628
01:09:29.961 --> 01:09:33.290
<v Speaker 1>the narrator for those old fights because they didn't really have audio for them</v>

2629
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.760
<v Speaker 1>to like was correct.</v>

2630
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:38.720
<v Speaker 1>But more interesting example is when Ali's camp cheated,</v>

2631
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:40.880
<v Speaker 1>when Henry Cooper caught him with a left hook,</v>

2632
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Henry Cooper caught him with a left hook and sat him down.</v>

2633
01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Henry Cooper was his bad ass British heavyweight boxer back in the day.</v>

2634
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And when Muhammad Ali was still Cassius clay and recoup or correct him and he</v>

2635
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:55.880
<v Speaker 1>went down and when he went back to the corner,</v>

2636
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:57.400
<v Speaker 1>he had no idea what the fuck was going on.</v>

2637
01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:58.460
<v Speaker 1>He was out on his feet.</v>

2638
01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:01.670
<v Speaker 1>So Angelo Dundee took a razor blade to his gloves,</v>

2639
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.470
<v Speaker 1>cut his gloves open.</v>

2640
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.880
<v Speaker 1>So you got to change the gloves.</v>

2641
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>The gloves are cut.</v>

2642
01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:07.120
<v Speaker 1>It moves smart.</v>

2643
01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 1>That Dante's shit smart dude back then.</v>

2644
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:13.700
<v Speaker 1>So Ali has a chance to recover.</v>

2645
01:10:13.701 --> 01:10:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Several minutes go by.</v>

2646
01:10:14.751 --> 01:10:15.590
<v Speaker 1>They change the gloves,</v>

2647
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:16.630
<v Speaker 1>they retire him up there.</v>

2648
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Retape them several minutes go by and then he fucks.</v>

2649
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Henry Cooper up gets get some cut and winds up stopping.</v>

2650
01:10:22.581 --> 01:10:23.414
<v Speaker 1>I'm on cuts.</v>

2651
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Did it work?</v>

2652
01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2653
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:25.833
<v Speaker 1>but don't want to see it.</v>

2654
01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2655
01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.720
<v Speaker 1>watch Henry Cooper drops Muhammad Ali because I mean dude,</v>

2656
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:34.721
<v Speaker 1>he got Joe romped like that's very similar to your role at UL in the corner.</v>

2657
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 1>By the time you were just that Tim Kennedy fight,</v>

2658
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennedy should have gotten a wheel gate kept Tim Kennedy should have gotten</v>

2659
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>the wind because he was not willing to get off his stool and fight.</v>

2660
01:10:46.011 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the round,</v>

2661
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:47.570
<v Speaker 1>he knew correct.</v>

2662
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.560
<v Speaker 1>It was the end of the,</v>

2663
01:10:48.561 --> 01:10:48.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2664
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:49.603
<v Speaker 1>the buzzer.</v>

2665
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:50.421
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

2666
01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:50.681
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2667
01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:51.800
<v Speaker 1>when are we going to see him fight?</v>

2668
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy Police would fucked up.</v>

2669
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy after that fight.</v>

2670
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that here?</v>

2671
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Those are the gloves,</v>

2672
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:59.330
<v Speaker 1>the actual glove that it was split.</v>

2673
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2674
01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.750
<v Speaker 1>She got the fuck out of that video of him cutting it.</v>

2675
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 1>They like covered each other up.</v>

2676
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And if they weren't doing videos back then,</v>

2677
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:08.780
<v Speaker 1>they had a film of the fight and then you know,</v>

2678
01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:12.680
<v Speaker 1>there was probably one hand you're saying there's no concrete evidence.</v>

2679
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Well that gloves,</v>

2680
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.760
<v Speaker 1>the gloves are caught up and then they have the gloves.</v>

2681
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>It happened naturally.</v>

2682
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>

2683
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:19.223
<v Speaker 1>it could be like,</v>

2684
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.801
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2685

2693
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about too.</v>

2694
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:36.840

2696
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:40.830
<v Speaker 1>The very end of the round he gets up and he sits down.</v>

2697
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:41.131

2706
01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2707
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

2708
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:55.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be legit.</v>

2718
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I never heard of liquid cocaine being drank like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that Guy Panama Lewis was busted for a bunch of different things and one of them</v>

2731
01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2732
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 1>he had this fight,</v>

2733
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:34.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2734
01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:36.270
<v Speaker 1>between a Billy Collins,</v>

2735
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Billy Collins Jr was his name.</v>

2736
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 1>And the other guy was a Louie Resto and um,</v>

2737
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:47.990
<v Speaker 1>they took Louie Resto is padding out of his gloves and when he fought this kid,</v>

2738
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.161
<v Speaker 1>Billy,</v>

2739
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Billy Collins Jr I think that was his name.</v>

2740
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:53.570
<v Speaker 1>GMC,</v>

2741
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.403
<v Speaker 1>if that's correct.</v>

2742
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Louie Resto.</v>

2743
01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a Louie Resto glove controversy.</v>

2744
01:12:59.250 --> 01:12:59.821
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2745
01:12:59.821 --> 01:13:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Panama Lewis was the guy who did that too.</v>

2746
01:13:01.921 --> 01:13:03.360
<v Speaker 1>He was involved in that.</v>

2747
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

2748
01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:05.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2749
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 1>he was banned from boxing after that.</v>

2750
01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:08.000
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't going right.</v>

2751
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:08.721
<v Speaker 1>He was so,</v>

2752
01:13:08.721 --> 01:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it was a cheater.</v>

2753
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.380
<v Speaker 1>He had went through that thing with Aaron Pryor and then he'd went through this,</v>

2754
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:14.070
<v Speaker 1>this new one.</v>

2755
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 1>But who knows what the fuck was in that bottle.</v>

2756
01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:17.280
<v Speaker 1>It could've been anything.</v>

2757
01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It could've been a stimulant,</v>

2758
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:22.260
<v Speaker 1>but it could have been like some sort of fucking sport drink.</v>

2759
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It could have been,</v>

2760
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:23.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2761
01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:28.320
<v Speaker 1>something with some sort of a nutritional supplement in it that maybe is illegal</v>

2762
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2763
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.371
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't illegal then.</v>

2764
01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.031
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

2765
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:30.841
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he put in there.</v>

2766
01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I think they might've used speed a lot.</v>

2767
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I know Andre Agassi in his,</v>

2768
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2769
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:38.930
<v Speaker 1>in his autobiography he talks about how his dad used to give him speed head and</v>

2770
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>like in the middle,</v>

2771
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.690

2775
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 1>four hours,</v>

<v Speaker 1>four hours or whenever it was.</v>

2777
01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And he would,</v>

2778
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:50.280
<v Speaker 1>he would give his son and his brother's,</v>

2779
01:13:50.281 --> 01:13:50.791

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.270
<v Speaker 3>And I think everybody does that.</v>

2992
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 3>I do something even I think I do something even more ridiculous.</v>

2993
01:18:56.450 --> 01:19:01.450
<v Speaker 3>I daily have a fantasy that I live in a part of the world where gangs are</v>

2994
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:06.731
<v Speaker 3>running everything and you are terrorizing my village or my Los Angeles run.</v>

2995
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 3>And what I do then is I secretly,</v>

2996
01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I push a cart of food cart.</v>

2997
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm humble,</v>

2998
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:17.720
<v Speaker 3>but I have a small gun with a silencer and I kill all the bad guys quietly and</v>

2999
01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:17.901
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3000
01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:18.381
<v Speaker 3>well fuck,</v>

01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:20.210
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is going on?</v>

3003
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.960
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3004
01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.060
<v Speaker 3>would you like another plot of the professional?</v>

3005
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3006
01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 3>That's literally how I think about how I protect myself.</v>

3007
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:28.041
<v Speaker 3>Totally Sane.</v>

3008
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:28.874
<v Speaker 3>All of you.</v>

3009
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:29.743

3010
01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:31.673
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

3011
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I thought something similar.</v>

3012
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

3013
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:37.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3014
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:38.190
<v Speaker 3>this isn't what I'm talking.</v>

3015
01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:38.451
<v Speaker 3>What if?</v>

3016
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:43.130
<v Speaker 3>What if you could figure out how long it takes to kill someone with a choke and</v>

3017
01:19:43.131 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 3>then how long it takes to put him in a vegetative state permanently.</v>

3018
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.271

<v Speaker 3>You mastered that.</v>

3021
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:50.600
<v Speaker 3>So like anybody,</v>

3022
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:54.230
<v Speaker 3>like you're like a vigilante and anybody who deserves to be a vegetable,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You didn't kill him.</v>

3028
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:02.220
<v Speaker 3>That's genius to kill him.</v>

3029
01:20:02.221 --> 01:20:03.054
<v Speaker 3>But they're like,</v>

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:05.573
<v Speaker 3>Hold the time.</v>

3033
01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:06.861
<v Speaker 3>One by one.</v>

3034
01:20:06.861 --> 01:20:07.694
<v Speaker 3>You just turn</v>

3035

<v Speaker 2>Would I go to jail for holding the tires?</v>

3065
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:57.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jujitsu Dexter's jet.</v>

3066
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that conversation?</v>

3067
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:03.250
<v Speaker 2>We had ones about guys getting hit so hard that it turns some gay and can</v>

3068
01:21:03.251 --> 01:21:08.251
<v Speaker 2>imagine went off for at least we went off for at least an hour like children</v>

3069
01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:14.010
<v Speaker 2>about how incredible it be if like dude's like how to get revenge because the</v>

3070
01:21:14.011 --> 01:21:17.980
<v Speaker 2>guy turned him gay and they showed up for the next fight with a parasol and like</v>

3071
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.930
<v Speaker 2>pink pink clothes.</v>

3072
01:21:18.931 --> 01:21:20.490
<v Speaker 2>I like holding a handbag.</v>

3073
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:22.860
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't been the same age and they fucks him.</v>

3074
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.083
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

3075
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 2>someone knocked him out so bad that they turned gay and that it was a,</v>

3076
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:29.130
<v Speaker 2>there was a possibility like you can,</v>

3077
01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 2>you know he can get CTE.</v>

3078
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:35.190
<v Speaker 2>The idea is it's like you like imagine if sitting,</v>

3079
01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:35.650
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

3080
01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:36.301
<v Speaker 2>what if it was like,</v>

3081
01:21:36.301 --> 01:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I think what it was the thing like,</v>

3082
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 2>like there was a keep you from breeding.</v>

3083
01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 2>If you got your ass kicked,</v>

3084
01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 2>like in the wolves population,</v>

3085
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:42.960
<v Speaker 2>the Alphas and the Betas,</v>

3086
01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:43.501
<v Speaker 2>Duke it out.</v>

3087
01:21:43.501 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 2>The Beatty gets kicked out of the crew if he gets his ass kicked.</v>

3088
01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:45.960
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3089
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.560
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3090
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it would be something like that with two guys.</v>

3091
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Duke it out.</v>

3092
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 2>One guy beat your ass.</v>

3093
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 2>He turns you gay every time.</v>

3094
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.810
<v Speaker 2>How much movie over the stakes be Nolan's file you love.</v>

3095
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:57.410
<v Speaker 2>No one's fighting anybody.</v>

3096
01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.850
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about like how much do you remember the conversation?</v>

3097
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:00.833
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

3099
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.360
<v Speaker 2>So we were like,</v>

3100
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 2>how much more dangerous would fighting B would if you lost you turn gay.</v>

3101
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:07.721
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3102
01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you'd kill people that carry helmets.</v>

3103
01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Someone Kod you if you became gay.</v>

3104
01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:11.710

<v Speaker 2>He's been knocked out more than anyone know fighters ever.</v>

3108
01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:19.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like starting to slur.</v>

3109
01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:19.630
<v Speaker 2>That worked it.</v>

3112
01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:25.190
<v Speaker 2>You'd see signs of it,</v>

3113
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.770
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to hide it</v>

3114
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:31.180
<v Speaker 2>slowly with like wooden beads,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It'd be more something you'd be like,</v>

3128
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I think over in this is plucking his eyebrows.</v>

3139
01:23:13.271 --> 01:23:16.240
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you have to get a wind back to get your heterosexual back.</v>

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:05.180
<v Speaker 3>the people you're hanging out with.</v>

3255
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I've come across a lot of different people in this world and I think at a</v>

3256
01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.030
<v Speaker 3>certain point in time,</v>

3257
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I personally think we've got to stop like thinking everybody's got to live the</v>

3258
01:26:18.561 --> 01:26:19.260
<v Speaker 3>same way.</v>

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.031
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3261
01:26:20.031 --> 01:26:20.380
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

3262
01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:23.500
<v Speaker 3>if somebody gets pregnant at 18 and they marry the,</v>

3263
01:26:23.501 --> 01:26:27.350
<v Speaker 3>the their high school sweetheart 18 that shit sometimes worked.</v>

3264
01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:28.030

3267
01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:33.020

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:39.710
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that,</v>

3273
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's also everybody's fucking different.</v>

3274
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3275
01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 3>That's like for some people they find the right person like real early and they</v>

3276
01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 3>just grow together.</v>

3277
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:53.270
<v Speaker 3>They figure out a way to be like really open and friendly really early and they</v>

3278
01:26:53.271 --> 01:26:53.900
<v Speaker 3>grow together.</v>

3279
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 3>There's also nothing worse.</v>

3280
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 3>When I meet a 50 year old and we have a friend like this who's not married,</v>

3281
01:26:58.670 --> 01:26:59.620
<v Speaker 3>has no girlfriend,</v>

3282
01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.850
<v Speaker 3>still playing the field and he's lonely as fuck.</v>

3283
01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how this movie ends my mat.</v>

3284
01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone's fucking George Clooney Buddy.</v>

3285
01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3286
01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:06.560
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3287
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 3>It looks fun.</v>

3288
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:08.270
<v Speaker 3>But once they were lonely,</v>

3289
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:09.350
<v Speaker 3>men were,</v>

3290
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:11.030
<v Speaker 3>there were times in my life and,</v>

3291
01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.750
<v Speaker 3>and me and Joe discussed this many times before we had kids like,</v>

3292
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.890

3294
01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.270
<v Speaker 3>do you want,</v>

3295
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:18.470
<v Speaker 3>I think I don't want kids,</v>

3296
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:18.951
<v Speaker 3>but not now,</v>

3297
01:27:18.951 --> 01:27:19.930
<v Speaker 3>but maybe.</v>

3298
01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:21.081
<v Speaker 3>And then a lot of these like,</v>

3299
01:27:21.081 --> 01:27:21.321
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

3300
01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:22.101
<v Speaker 3>I don't want kids.</v>

3301
01:27:22.101 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

3302
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:23.470
<v Speaker 3>And then you'd,</v>

3303
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:26.750
<v Speaker 3>you'd see fathers on planes with their kids are like full.</v>

3304
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:28.100
<v Speaker 3>We're lucky we're not them.</v>

3305
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 3>So there were times,</v>

3306
01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.073
<v Speaker 3>or I,</v>

3307
01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.093
<v Speaker 3>I thought like,</v>

3308
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:31.611
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3309
01:27:31.611 --> 01:27:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any kids.</v>

3310
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.900
<v Speaker 3>I think I was afraid that I was going to feel the same way about my kids is my</v>

3311
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:41.150
<v Speaker 3>real dad felt about me and that would have been a nightmare.</v>

3312
01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:45.830
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like maybe I got that same shit that my dad has that he don't give a fuck</v>

3313
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:46.580
<v Speaker 3>about us kids.</v>

3314
01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.091
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

3315
01:27:47.091 --> 01:27:52.091
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid to have kids cause I'm afraid that my kid is going to feel about me</v>

3316
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:55.220
<v Speaker 3>like I feel about my dad and that would make me want to fucking hang myself.</v>

3317
01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:56.790
<v Speaker 3>So there was a lot of times,</v>

3318
01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.031
<v Speaker 3>no kids,</v>

3319
01:27:59.031 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 3>no kids,</v>

3320
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:00.740
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like maybe kids,</v>

3321
01:28:00.741 --> 01:28:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3322
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:02.091
<v Speaker 3>Same thing Joe.</v>

3323
01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

3324
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:04.630
<v Speaker 3>there's no kids this,</v>

3325
01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:05.301
<v Speaker 3>I will say this,</v>

3326
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:06.134
<v Speaker 3>let me finish real quick.</v>

3327
01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Let me finish this really quick.</v>

3328
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:08.990
<v Speaker 3>If I was,</v>

3329
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.500
<v Speaker 3>if I was,</v>

3330
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.440
<v Speaker 3>if I find out I was going to die in five minutes,</v>

3331
01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.270
<v Speaker 3>one of my messages would be to all of these kids growing up and everything than</v>

3332
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:16.850
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3333
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:17.683
<v Speaker 3>Like my,</v>

3334
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.830
<v Speaker 3>my version of the meaning of life really after all this shit after no kids,</v>

3335
01:28:21.831 --> 01:28:22.970
<v Speaker 3>kids full Kevin kids,</v>

3336
01:28:22.971 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 3>I want to be free and all that shit.</v>

3337
01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I live single up to,</v>

3338
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:31.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm 40 I would say having kids is the meaning of life.</v>

3339
01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:32.180
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3340
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:32.991
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would say.</v>

3341
01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:33.711
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm wrong,</v>

3342
01:28:33.711 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I would say.</v>

3343
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:36.100
<v Speaker 3>So the reason why we're here,</v>

3344
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 3>I would leave,</v>

3345
01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I would leave my advice like you're all confused and all that shit.</v>

3346
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.870
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day when you,</v>

3347
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:45.020
<v Speaker 3>when you're getting old and everyone's going to get old unless they die young,</v>

3348
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.130
<v Speaker 3>but when you get old,</v>

3349
01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:46.993
<v Speaker 3>watch,</v>

3350
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 3>your kids are everything there.</v>

3351
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked there.</v>

3352
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.363
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>

3353
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.510
<v Speaker 3>And then your grandkids.</v>

3354
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.613
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

3355
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:55.521
<v Speaker 3>without kids.</v>

3356
01:28:55.521 --> 01:28:57.680
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to grow old and alone in my,</v>

3357
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:58.511
<v Speaker 3>if I was going to die,</v>

3358
01:28:58.511 --> 01:28:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I would say don't do,</v>

3359
01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.093
<v Speaker 3>try to have,</v>

3360
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 3>don't die old and alone.</v>

3361
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:05.521
<v Speaker 3>You only have one though.</v>

3362
01:29:05.521 --> 01:29:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3363
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:07.170

<v Speaker 3>Let's pop out more than yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's 10 I'm going to stop with this.</v>

3382

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:40.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you might feel the same way if you're with your kids and you feel sometimes</v>

3385
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 3>you're with your kid and you're spending these beautiful moments together,</v>

3386
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:49.650
<v Speaker 3>but you're thinking about all this stressful shit and all these decisions you've</v>

01:29:56.581 --> 01:29:59.370
<v Speaker 3>I thought this was all that fight pass.</v>

3394
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.240
<v Speaker 3>This is stressful shit and I'm thinking I'm here,</v>

3397
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.390
<v Speaker 3>these are the moments I'm going to be thinking about when I'm dying and I'm</v>

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:13.853
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3400
01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:17.550
<v Speaker 3>this is a moment that I would want to come back to if there was a time machine</v>

3401
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:18.503
<v Speaker 3>and I can get back,</v>

3403
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I would be thinking about every millisecond I had with my son on the beach</v>

3404
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 3>playing in the water and shit.</v>

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.200

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.033
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3421
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:47.933
<v Speaker 3>I want more.</v>

3422
01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3423
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.093
<v Speaker 3>I'm done</v>

3424
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:53.970
<v Speaker 3>to what you're saying is all beautiful.</v>

3425
01:30:53.971 --> 01:30:54.451
<v Speaker 3>For sure,</v>

3426
01:30:54.451 --> 01:30:54.691
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3427
01:30:54.691 --> 01:30:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried.</v>

3428
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:56.100
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important thing.</v>

3429
01:30:56.101 --> 01:30:57.120
<v Speaker 3>When I find myself,</v>

3430
01:30:57.230 --> 01:30:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3431
01:30:57.450 --> 01:30:57.631
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

3432
01:30:57.631 --> 01:30:58.231
<v Speaker 3>I got all this shit.</v>

3433
01:30:58.231 --> 01:30:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3434
01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.593
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3435
01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:00.623
<v Speaker 3>US.</v>

3436
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.830
<v Speaker 3>I think for all of us,</v>

3437
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:05.220
<v Speaker 3>like living in the moment is very important and it's tough to do.</v>

3438
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:05.671
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

3439
01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:06.210
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do.</v>

3440
01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:09.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like something you've got to be real conscious of because it's so easy to</v>

3441
01:31:09.391 --> 01:31:11.880
<v Speaker 3>get trapped up with your thoughts.</v>

3442
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:15.060

3621
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:11.240
<v Speaker 2>What what she's capable of doing is,</v>

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3626
01:37:19.281 --> 01:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>size as her.</v>

3627
01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>She would kill him.</v>

3707
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.300
<v Speaker 3>there's not saying that women can't beat the fuck out of men.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They absolutely can,</v>

3709
01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.640
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain weight,</v>

3710
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.350
<v Speaker 3>it becomes weird.</v>

3711
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.970
<v Speaker 3>And it depends on what kind of athlete you're talking about.</v>

01:39:46.891 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 3>it depends if they have any,</v>

3715
01:39:48.690 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 3>any experience in moving their body at all.</v>

4018
01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:25.290
<v Speaker 2>any woman in the world that wants to get crazy could step up</v>

4020
01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:31.170
<v Speaker 2>No training camp.</v>

4021
01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.460
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about a fucking train again.</v>

4022
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 2>What does you just Ray Lewis,</v>

4023
01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:35.693
<v Speaker 2>you took my training</v>

4024
01:49:37.610 --> 01:49:38.443
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

4025
01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:42.750
<v Speaker 2>He finds out.</v>

4026
01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4027
01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.090
<v Speaker 2>and then you fight cyborg versus rate.</v>

4028
01:49:47.130 --> 01:49:49.420
<v Speaker 2>My money would be on Ray Lewis 100% of the time.</v>

4029
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.313
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

4030
01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm shocked.</v>

4031
01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Really standing.</v>

4032
01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 2>You're shocked with my do not want football.</v>

4033
01:49:55.710 --> 01:49:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Watch football.</v>

4034
01:49:56.230 --> 01:49:56.471
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4035
01:49:56.471 --> 01:49:57.370
<v Speaker 2>but let me tell you this.</v>

4036
01:49:57.371 --> 01:50:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I got my money on Cyborg 100% a hundred times in a row against Ben Affleck.</v>

4037
01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Throw down a house on the Brazilian Dow.</v>

4038
01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent a hundred percent gotta reset.</v>

4039
01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.470
<v Speaker 2>You would Paul the money on Ray Lewis though.</v>

4040
01:50:14.471 --> 01:50:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Ray Lewis is so much bigger and I think he probably knows how to fight.</v>

4041
01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not totally unskilled.</v>

4042
01:50:20.111 --> 01:50:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

4043
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:21.223
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

4044
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you got listen to the shot.</v>

4045
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she can stop the shot?</v>

4046
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Ray Lewis is a bad example.</v>

4047
01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.970
<v Speaker 2>You can stop the shot if a staff champion Rashad,</v>

4048
01:50:31.770 --> 01:50:33.610
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to tackle</v>

4049
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:41.220
<v Speaker 2>the Superbowl.</v>

4050
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Ray Ray though.</v>

4051
01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.271
<v Speaker 2>Sit Bad example.</v>

4052
01:50:43.271 --> 01:50:44.860
<v Speaker 2>He's just such a freak athlete.</v>

4053
01:50:44.861 --> 01:50:45.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4054
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:45.844

4061
01:51:09.491 --> 01:51:10.900
<v Speaker 2>She's 100% clean now.</v>

4062
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:11.793
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

4063
01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:13.270
<v Speaker 2>she's not,</v>

4064
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:16.900
<v Speaker 2>she's not crazy up no more cause cyborg get beat Louis like this.</v>

4065
01:51:16.901 --> 01:51:17.734

4066
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

4067
01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Because not because we live in the real world,</v>

4068

4075
01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.151
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

4076
01:51:34.151 --> 01:51:34.870
<v Speaker 2>You would kill him.</v>

4077
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:35.370

4081
01:51:38.681 --> 01:51:39.514
<v Speaker 2>If he'd never trained,</v>

4082
01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.740
<v Speaker 2>you would choke him.</v>

4083
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:41.920
<v Speaker 2>We till he's trained.</v>

4150
01:53:40.761 --> 01:53:42.650
<v Speaker 2>but that's why he's so great at everything he does.</v>

4151
01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 2>He's also right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>gets obsessed with things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He is right.</v>

4154
01:53:44.961 --> 01:53:45.591
<v Speaker 2>He's also right.</v>

4155
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:50.591
<v Speaker 2>But he gets obsessed with things and it's why it's why he's this Jujitsu.</v>

01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

4159
01:53:54.181 --> 01:53:56.210
<v Speaker 2>And his mind works like that with everything and it's,</v>

4160
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:58.340
<v Speaker 2>it's working like that with parenthood too,</v>

4161
01:53:58.341 --> 01:54:01.370
<v Speaker 2>which is a beautiful thing if you're not obsessed with a kid that I kind of</v>

4162
01:54:01.371 --> 01:54:02.204
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>

4163
01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people aren't.</v>

4164
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:07.100
<v Speaker 2>It's uncommon for sure to think that there's said that we don't really care and</v>

4165
01:54:07.101 --> 01:54:09.300
<v Speaker 2>they don't love people that are with them and they're don't,</v>

4166
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 2>don't love their families.</v>

4167
01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

4168
01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.491
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>

4169
01:54:12.491 --> 01:54:13.201
<v Speaker 2>I brightened their day.</v>

4170
01:54:13.201 --> 01:54:13.461
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

4171
01:54:13.461 --> 01:54:14.210
<v Speaker 2>that's not fair.</v>

4172
01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:15.043
<v Speaker 2>Hey Bro.</v>

4173
01:54:17.230 --> 01:54:19.670
<v Speaker 2>I said it twice in a really weird way.</v>

4174
01:54:19.671 --> 01:54:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Like in a movie I went,</v>

4175
01:54:20.511 --> 01:54:23.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people aren't Brennan Brennan.</v>

4176
01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:24.920
<v Speaker 2>When you say something twice,</v>

4177
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:26.570
<v Speaker 2>it's always kind of like one of those things.</v>

4178
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:27.623
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

4179
01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:30.620
<v Speaker 2>know it means something else that you can take.</v>

4180
01:54:30.621 --> 01:54:31.011
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

4181
01:54:31.011 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Ready Joe?</v>

4182
01:54:32.781 --> 01:54:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Rogan's a strong hold on Joe Rogan's a strong guy.</v>

4183
01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:37.880
<v Speaker 2>He's a strong guy.</v>

4184
01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.171
<v Speaker 2>You're dead.</v>

4185
01:54:39.171 --> 01:54:39.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4186
01:54:39.391 --> 01:54:40.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to live.</v>

4187
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:42.110
<v Speaker 2>You can sarcastically expect,</v>

4188
01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:44.610
<v Speaker 2>especially if you flatly,</v>

4189
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:45.111
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4190
01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:46.130
<v Speaker 2>you can do a lot of different things.</v>

4191
01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:51.140
<v Speaker 2>What I thought sometimes it's dead serious if you like overemphasize the second</v>

4192
01:54:51.141 --> 01:54:51.974
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

4193
01:54:52.330 --> 01:54:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Did you like Conor McGregor is a bad motherfucker,</v>

01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Can you say it three times and change the third times?</v>

4203
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:05.264
<v Speaker 2>Meaning</v>

4204
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:10.280
<v Speaker 2>like what do you mean Greg is Bama is bad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That mother fucker is bad.</v>

4206
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:14.050
<v Speaker 2>You see I'm just pulling boat.</v>

01:55:17.631 --> 01:55:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Aurora.</v>

4210
01:55:18.370 --> 01:55:19.203
<v Speaker 2>What we do,</v>

4211
01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:21.940
<v Speaker 2>remember when Kimbo slice asked you if you were black,</v>

4212
01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:23.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4213
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of my favorite steps.</v>

4214
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.350
<v Speaker 2>The way,</v>

4215
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:28.160
<v Speaker 2>say mostly stuff that he was black.</v>

4216
01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:32.330
<v Speaker 2>They had heard that there was a guy on the podcast or on the podcast on the</v>

4217
01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:33.290
<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighter.</v>

4218
01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.153
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4219
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Tell slate does us Kamozi he taps</v>

4220

<v Speaker 2>Dallas's Jujitsu's legitimate farts.</v>

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:45.090
<v Speaker 1>ladies,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's a big win for [inaudible].</v>

4225
01:55:47.630 --> 01:55:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4226
01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him in a long time.</v>

4227
01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:54.240
<v Speaker 1>So there was a guy on the ultimate fighter that was a possibly a Nazi.</v>

4228
01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:54.900
<v Speaker 1>He went full,</v>

<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And they got together and they were,</v>

4232
01:55:57.930 --> 01:55:58.380
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

4233
01:55:58.380 --> 01:55:59.310
<v Speaker 1>they were all talking about it.</v>

4234
01:55:59.311 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 1>And they went to Brendon cause it said,</v>

4235
01:56:01.351 --> 01:56:01.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4236
01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:02.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4237
01:56:02.281 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 1>they thought that Brendan was black and Brown is like,</v>

4238
01:56:04.021 --> 01:56:04.201
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4239
01:56:04.201 --> 01:56:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not black.</v>

4240
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:07.140
<v Speaker 1>So you ain't black and Kimbo so what did he say?</v>

4241
01:56:07.141 --> 01:56:07.411
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4242
01:56:07.411 --> 01:56:08.244
<v Speaker 1>that's why</v>

4243
01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I love the chuck is until,</v>

4244
01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you</v>

4245
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:20.800

4246
01:56:21.170 --> 01:56:23.020
<v Speaker 1>has always had a nasty Cho.</v>

4247

<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

4249
01:56:26.661 --> 01:56:28.520
<v Speaker 1>If he would have held that in for 30 more seconds,</v>

4250
01:56:28.521 --> 01:56:30.020
<v Speaker 1>he would have turned them into a vegetable.</v>

4251
01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:31.011
<v Speaker 1>Get chance.</v>

4252
01:56:31.011 --> 01:56:31.721
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's rafts.</v>

01:56:31.721 --> 01:56:32.554
<v Speaker 1>They're red here.</v>

4254
01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.411
<v Speaker 1>There's a play,</v>

4255
01:56:33.411 --> 01:56:38.411
<v Speaker 1>a sick play called the Toyer and it's about this guy who has been coming into</v>

4256
01:56:38.811 --> 01:56:43.640
<v Speaker 1>women's houses and he sticks a needle in their back that caused them to become</v>

4257
01:56:43.641 --> 01:56:45.170
<v Speaker 1>vegetables like you're talking about.</v>

4258
01:56:45.171 --> 01:56:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And then he like dresses them up like galls bevy.</v>

01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Look up there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you Jamie,</v>

4263
01:56:56.170 --> 01:56:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

4264
01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.773

4270
01:57:08.811 --> 01:57:13.550

4271
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:15.620
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of work.</v>

4272
01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Listen to Photoshop,</v>

4273
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Steve.</v>

4274
01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:22.820
<v Speaker 2>They're already doing it right and there people are doing it right now.</v>

4275
01:57:22.821 --> 01:57:23.690
<v Speaker 2>When you get out of here,</v>

4276
01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have 40 of them</v>

4277
01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:27.231
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>

4278
01:57:27.231 --> 01:57:28.064
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>

4279
01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Just regard that</v>

4280
01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:30.661
<v Speaker 1>request.</v>

4281
01:57:30.661 --> 01:57:31.301
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz,</v>

4282
01:57:31.301 --> 01:57:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor too.</v>

4283
01:57:32.321 --> 01:57:34.600
<v Speaker 1>What's your call and give a call it,</v>

4284
01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever yell.</v>

4285
01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

4286
01:57:35.890 --> 01:57:36.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm being dramatic.</v>

4287
01:57:36.581 --> 01:57:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Listen man.</v>

4288
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz has a full camp,</v>

4289
01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:40.660
<v Speaker 1>but he also has all that goddamn press.</v>

4290
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He's also got all that pressure and Connor has an opportunity to prepare</v>

4291
01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:47.200
<v Speaker 1>exclusively just for him.</v>

4292
01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like he didn't have some success in the first fight because a lot</v>

4293
01:57:50.631 --> 01:57:52.450
<v Speaker 1>of pretty much dominated the first round.</v>

4294
01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:53.441
<v Speaker 1>He looked beautiful,</v>

4295
01:57:53.441 --> 01:57:58.441
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was he tried to use those one hitter quitter punches.</v>

4296
01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:01.060
<v Speaker 1>He tried to just crack them and drop them.</v>

4297
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:02.980
<v Speaker 1>And Nate is a bigger,</v>

4298
01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:06.340
<v Speaker 1>stronger man than most of the people that Connor's fought.</v>

4299
01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.200
<v Speaker 1>And he knows how to absorb punches.</v>

4300
01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:13.210

01:58:15.791 --> 01:58:16.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the results.</v>

4313
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:27.580
<v Speaker 1>He's so God damn smart.</v>

4314
01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.080
<v Speaker 1>When he breaks down boxing,</v>

4315
01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:31.740
<v Speaker 1>like when he does a the analyst position on each photo,</v>

4316
01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>

4340
01:59:00.821 --> 01:59:03.070
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about played for the Detroit Lions Yas.</v>

4341

01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:04.223
<v Speaker 1>Call it.</v>

4343
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with Andre Berto in camp confused.</v>

4344
01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

4345
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:12.243
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

4346
01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I had this conversation with Andre Berto.</v>

4347
01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:19.120
<v Speaker 1>What about Andre Ward and because they're in the same camp and their buddies,</v>

4348
01:59:19.121 --> 01:59:23.020
<v Speaker 1>they came together and he was telling me that he learned a lot just watching</v>

4349
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:23.831
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward,</v>

4350
01:59:23.831 --> 01:59:25.750
<v Speaker 1>like when the wave version of hunter has him do it.</v>

4351
01:59:25.751 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 1>If you watch him warm up,</v>

4352
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:28.600
<v Speaker 1>he'll do things.</v>

4353
01:59:28.630 --> 01:59:32.530
<v Speaker 1>He's so technical where he like literally will just,</v>

4354
01:59:32.531 --> 01:59:34.510
<v Speaker 1>he won't throw punches when shadow boxes.</v>

4355
01:59:34.511 --> 01:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>He spends a lot of time literally just doing the perfect kind of hooks.</v>

4356
01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is like he's obsessed with people and not watching it.</v>

4357
01:59:43.271 --> 01:59:43.571
<v Speaker 1>You do it.</v>

4358
01:59:43.571 --> 01:59:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Everything super slow in the air and she has everything.</v>

4359
01:59:46.151 --> 01:59:48.550
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed with perfect technique,</v>

4360
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:53.790
<v Speaker 1>like every detail where his feet are and he always does that and he obsesses</v>

4361
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:59.011
<v Speaker 1>over exactly where his body is going to be in almost slow motion for a long time</v>

4362
01:59:59.321 --> 02:00:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and then he'll start doing things.</v>

4363
02:00:01.001 --> 02:00:03.700
<v Speaker 1>But well I didn't fundamentals when I was a kid.</v>

4364
02:00:03.701 --> 02:00:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that forms were stupid and I should think that like even</v>

4365
02:00:06.971 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>throwing kicks in the air couldn't compare to doing things like throwing kicks</v>

4366
02:00:11.081 --> 02:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>on the bag and they're like a lot of the decorative aspects of martial arts like</v>

4367
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4368
02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>throw a side kick and you hold it up there and then you throw second sidekick</v>

4369
02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and then you do all these different combinations that you'd have to do in these</v>

4370
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:20.680
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

4371
02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I just think they're stupid,</v>

4372
02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>but now understand that it's almost like you're doing like a form of yoga.</v>

4373
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4374
02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Throwing those kicks out there and you're holding them in place and even though</v>

4375
02:00:29.891 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>that's not how you would ever fight,</v>

4376
02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>these are all important movements.</v>

4377
02:00:34.181 --> 02:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>If you could figure out how to do that and make it beautiful.</v>

4378
02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Float while also body control.</v>

4379
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4380
02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:41.200
<v Speaker 1>control body control.</v>

4381
02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Hey Jamie and bring up to Andre Ward for like sidekicks.</v>

4382
02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>That is like one of the most important aspects of throwing a sidekick is</v>

4383
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>throwing it in the air.</v>

4384
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Learning how to throw it in the air while your body is moving forward because if</v>

4385
02:00:54.671 --> 02:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you use a bag prematurely,</v>

4386
02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you grow up customed to bouncing off of it and that's the difference between</v>

4387
02:01:01.571 --> 02:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>someone who bounces off of that technique and drives through it and the person</v>

4388
02:01:05.921 --> 02:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>who drives through it,</v>

4389
02:01:07.031 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 1>when they drive with their hip,</v>

4390
02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.040
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more power and it takes the same amount of time.</v>

4391
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference in the amount of time,</v>

4392
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of force that someone who knows how to really drive their hip</v>

4393
02:01:17.681 --> 02:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

4394
02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>that you developed that a lot of is by kicking the air cause you snap and you</v>

4395
02:01:22.811 --> 02:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>extend that side kick out and you pull it back and you snap and it's all about</v>

4396
02:01:26.771 --> 02:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>doing it as fast as you can.</v>

4397
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And then once you developed the technique perfectly,</v>

4398
02:01:31.031 --> 02:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>then you start moving to kicking things.</v>

4399
02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>And usually it's a person with a cushion.</v>

4400
02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>They moves towards you slowly or it's a really light bag and you slowly develop</v>

4401
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>ability to move your weight into it.</v>

4402
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't do it right,</v>

4403
02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>you can develop.</v>

4404
02:01:43.641 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>This is this one aspect of that kick that most people have,</v>

4405
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>which is they kick off of people.</v>

4406
02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>They kicked him and they push off.</v>

4407
02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:50.841
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

4408
02:01:50.841 --> 02:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>The woman,</v>

4409
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4410
02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

4411
02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>in who's responsible for the Russian revolution and tennis,</v>

4412
02:01:56.210 --> 02:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>like she came out with a sharp pauvre off and all the,</v>

4413
02:01:58.551 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4414
02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Poba and all these movies,</v>

4415
02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>these amazing tennis player.</v>

4416
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>She will have her students in a group before they even hit a ball.</v>

4417
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Just slowly,</v>

4418
02:02:09.590 --> 02:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4419
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>literally just practicing their stroke in a really slow manner.</v>

4420
02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the same exact thing that clutch goes.</v>

4421
02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Does the same thing the first week there?</v>

4422
02:02:17.751 --> 02:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the first two weeks of the camp is all basics and super slowly.</v>

4423
02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4424
02:02:21.190 --> 02:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Jamie put bring up Andre Ward like shadow box and warming up.</v>

4425
02:02:24.590 --> 02:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>It's really wild to watch.</v>

4426
02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Nobody upset a bit going on right now though.</v>

4427
02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4428
02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>it is really interesting man.</v>

4429
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It really interesting like though the idea of what is the best way to learn how</v>

4430
02:02:35.901 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 1>to execute certain techniques,</v>

4431
02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>which there's always,</v>

4432
02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>there's always a lot of debate about it,</v>

4433
02:02:40.521 --> 02:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4434
02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of debate about how much sparring you should do versus how much</v>

4435
02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>you know simulation drills you should do versus how much bad work you should do</v>

4436
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>when this might be it.</v>

4437
02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is the one we're watching them right now.</v>

4438
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>There's another one where he's,</v>

4439
02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:55.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4440
02:02:55.881 --> 02:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>he's being watched right now so he's going to go faster.</v>

4441
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Well just doing regular shuttle them off to them,</v>

4442
02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:00.510
<v Speaker 1>but bringing up man,</v>

4443
02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:01.850

4444
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Bring up the other one.</v>

4445
02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Bring up the other one where he's,</v>

4446
02:03:04.281 --> 02:03:06.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll see it going to be,</v>

4447
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4448
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Look at how specific or too though I'm interested in.</v>

4449
02:03:10.431 --> 02:03:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know who won tonight,</v>

4450
02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but if Andre Ward wins,</v>

4451
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in him versus the one that's the plan.</v>

4452
02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It's for sure a cola has a fight.</v>

4453
02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>War has a fight.</v>

4454
02:03:20.101 --> 02:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>And then next is Covello very interested enough.</v>

4455
02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't walk man,</v>

4456
02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:24.890
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

4457
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:25.830
<v Speaker 1>if I had to put my money on.</v>

4458
02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:30.831
<v Speaker 1>So right now it's Cova love Kovalev is Cain killed a guy he did and he,</v>

4459
02:03:31.701 --> 02:03:32.330
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

4460
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I was really most impressed with what he's done.</v>

4461
02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:35.711
<v Speaker 1>Boxed pornography.</v>

4462
02:03:35.711 --> 02:03:36.544
<v Speaker 1>He's doing right.</v>

4463
02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Don't look at this.</v>

4464
02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Got He was boxing them up.</v>

4465
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:40.700
<v Speaker 1>It was going pretty fast.</v>

4466
02:03:42.670 --> 02:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4467
02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:43.953
<v Speaker 1>he's tried.</v>

4468
02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Some of it was slow.</v>

4469
02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:45.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4470
02:03:45.411 --> 02:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4471
02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that's super slow.</v>

4472
02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:46.890
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

4473
02:03:46.890 --> 02:03:51.320
<v Speaker 1>So now he's the most impressive shadowboxing I've ever seen.</v>

4474
02:03:51.321 --> 02:03:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought he's awesome.</v>

4475
02:03:53.070 --> 02:03:53.870
<v Speaker 1>He's so good.</v>

4476
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:54.531
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4477
02:03:54.531 --> 02:03:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's stolen those punches with power.</v>

4478
02:03:56.301 --> 02:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>You could tell them in the snap.</v>

4479
02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

4480
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>what's the perfect word?</v>

4481
02:03:59.951 --> 02:04:00.784
<v Speaker 1>Like when we were</v>

4482
02:04:02.610 --> 02:04:02.951
<v Speaker 1>caught up,</v>

4483
02:04:02.951 --> 02:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4484
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:04.530
<v Speaker 1>you want to forums called bubble.</v>

4485
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.340
<v Speaker 1>People talk shit on cotton for so long.</v>

4486
02:04:07.341 --> 02:04:08.174
<v Speaker 1>This is just caught up.</v>

4487
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4488
02:04:08.571 --> 02:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>it might be even better even than Catia.</v>

4489
02:04:10.650 --> 02:04:13.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting when you watch a guy like him do that as opposed to</v>

4490
02:04:13.731 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 1>that Russian gentleman that we were seeing earlier,</v>

4491
02:04:15.441 --> 02:04:16.460
<v Speaker 1>that's learning how to box.</v>

4492
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>That's where you see the difference.</v>

4493
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about best in the world for us,</v>

4494
02:04:19.481 --> 02:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>the guy who just had last week,</v>

4495
02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:22.160
<v Speaker 1>but those movements,</v>

4496
02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:23.450
<v Speaker 1>they're not unattainable.</v>

4497
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:24.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4498
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching someone do a move,</v>

4499
02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:28.071
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4500
02:04:28.071 --> 02:04:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Like say if they're doing a,</v>

4501
02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>they're choreographing Michael Jackson's thriller when all the dunes would do,</v>

4502
02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 1>all the zombies are doing.</v>

4503
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>That was like a choreographed thing,</v>

4504
02:04:35.721 --> 02:04:36.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4505
02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that there's similar movement,</v>

4506
02:04:38.701 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>everybody has similar movement.</v>

4507
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>That movement that he's doing is not attainable.</v>

4508
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>What he's doing is things that everyone can do.</v>

4509
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do it the way he's doing it.</v>

4510
02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:47.751
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

4511
02:04:47.751 --> 02:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>which is what makes it,</v>

4512
02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:51.630
<v Speaker 1>what makes it so special is nothing.</v>

4513
02:04:51.631 --> 02:04:56.220
<v Speaker 1>He's doing his crazy acrobatic ridiculous movements that the average person</v>

4514
02:04:56.221 --> 02:04:56.551
<v Speaker 1>can't do.</v>

4515
02:04:56.551 --> 02:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Like your Air Rodriguez,</v>

4516
02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>who are going to watch fight tonight.</v>

4517
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>This fucking dude does.</v>

4518
02:05:00.931 --> 02:05:05.931
<v Speaker 1>Why you old shit flying knee bars flying round kicks and jumping double round</v>

4519
02:05:06.961 --> 02:05:07.321
<v Speaker 1>kicks.</v>

4520
02:05:07.321 --> 02:05:07.920
<v Speaker 1>He's fun.</v>

4521
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculously,</v>

4522
02:05:09.391 --> 02:05:10.224
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4523
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:10.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4524
02:05:10.771 --> 02:05:14.370
<v Speaker 1>he's a talk with no guy can do the regular Mexican.</v>

4525
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4526
02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

4527
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>No Mexican is fuck.</v>

4528
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.133
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

4529
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4530
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:23.270
<v Speaker 1>so the what he's going to do the big differences.</v>

4531
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.200
<v Speaker 1>What he's gonna do his shit that we can't do.</v>

4532
02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at him throwing those kicks in like fuck,</v>

4533
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>like look at this crazy guy.</v>

4534
02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Like he's for jumping,</v>

4535
02:05:31.411 --> 02:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>spinning cartwheels through the air and roundhouse kick and dudes in the back of</v>

4536
02:05:34.831 --> 02:05:35.221
<v Speaker 1>the neck.</v>

4537
02:05:35.221 --> 02:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Like it ain't for everybody.</v>

4538
02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

4539
02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not for everybody.</v>

4540
02:05:39.271 --> 02:05:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Just most people have never gone that far with the Reps.</v>

4541
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think also some people aren't,</v>

4542
02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:47.340
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not like Cirque du Solei stuff,</v>

4543
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:48.833
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing,</v>

4544
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:51.270
<v Speaker 1>they take some genetic genetic.</v>

4545
02:05:51.271 --> 02:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>My point is that no one,</v>

4546
02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:54.421
<v Speaker 1>he's Mexican.</v>

4547
02:05:54.421 --> 02:05:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

4548
02:05:54.751 --> 02:05:55.584
<v Speaker 1>It's not genetic.</v>

4549
02:05:55.890 --> 02:05:56.723
<v Speaker 1>My point is it,</v>

4550
02:05:56.790 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 1>no one has a problem doing this or this or this or this.</v>

4551
02:06:01.770 --> 02:06:05.610
<v Speaker 1>No one has a problem with throwing a normal punch at a very slow pace.</v>

4552
02:06:05.970 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 1>But you can't even do what he's doing.</v>

4553
02:06:08.041 --> 02:06:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Like those cartwheel kicks.</v>

4554
02:06:09.121 --> 02:06:10.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't even do that slowly.</v>

4555
02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't move the way he's moving.</v>

4556
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 1>So the difference between what a guy like yeah here can do.</v>

4557
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And the guy like Andre War could do,</v>

4558
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even weigh it makes what Andre Ward can do even more impressive way</v>

4559
02:06:20.221 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 1>more than cause he's boxing guys up and he's doing it based on his understanding</v>

4560
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:27.210
<v Speaker 1>of each different position that might come up.</v>

4561
02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:30.210
<v Speaker 1>My two guys are trying to punch each other in the face and also the basic,</v>

4562
02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:31.710
<v Speaker 1>the basic superstar.</v>

4563
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:32.940
<v Speaker 1>But those basics,</v>

4564
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I could teach my daughter to do it if,</v>

4565
02:06:36.570 --> 02:06:39.690
<v Speaker 1>if she just listened to me and move slowly.</v>

4566
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you know,</v>

4567
02:06:40.891 --> 02:06:43.410
<v Speaker 1>someone could punch someone to hurt someone like immediately,</v>

4568
02:06:43.411 --> 02:06:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but I think you could take like a 60 year old executive.</v>

4569
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It never thrown a punch in his life and you have them stand there.</v>

4570
02:06:48.630 --> 02:06:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Just make him listen to you.</v>

4571
02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Make him put his foot here.</v>

4572
02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Lower your way,</v>

4573
02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:52.650
<v Speaker 1>lower your weight.</v>

4574
02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4575
02:06:53.010 --> 02:06:53.731
<v Speaker 1>Square shoulders,</v>

4576
02:06:53.731 --> 02:06:54.211
<v Speaker 1>hands up,</v>

4577
02:06:54.211 --> 02:06:54.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4578
02:06:54.421 --> 02:06:55.111
<v Speaker 1>Reaching bonds are,</v>

4579
02:06:55.111 --> 02:06:55.944
<v Speaker 1>and just do this.</v>

4580
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:57.103
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to do this.</v>

4581
02:06:57.180 --> 02:06:58.013
<v Speaker 1>Now do this.</v>

4582
02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4583
02:06:58.530 --> 02:07:00.480
<v Speaker 1>now try to get this same guy to do a wheel kick.</v>

4584
02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4585
02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:02.160
<v Speaker 1>like clothes.</v>

4586
02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So you're convert trick is to do is in one way more impressive cause he can do</v>

4587
02:07:07.591 --> 02:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>his physical shit that most people can't do.</v>

4588
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:13.440
<v Speaker 1>But another way it makes what Andre Ward does more impressive because Andre</v>

4589
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Ward,</v>

4590
02:07:13.530 --> 02:07:16.650
<v Speaker 1>he's way better than everybody else and just doing shit that everybody.</v>

4591
02:07:17.070 --> 02:07:17.903
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4592
02:07:19.330 --> 02:07:20.163
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>

4593
02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:25.180
<v Speaker 1>but what you're actually saying is that punching is more anatomically natural I</v>

4594
02:07:25.561 --> 02:07:27.960
<v Speaker 1>think to a human being walking around.</v>

4595
02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>What's season is ticking.</v>

4596
02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It's is really hard.</v>

4597
02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Like understanding I'm really good sidekick are around house her a wheel kicked</v>

4598
02:07:34.831 --> 02:07:35.830
<v Speaker 1>back and not natural.</v>

4599
02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

4600
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.530
<v Speaker 2>not natural it tastes like,</v>

4601
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's like everything else,</v>

4602
02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 2>even though punching it seems to attain,</v>

4603
02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>you can drill it into someone over and over and they can reach that razor sharp</v>

4604
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>level of,</v>

4605
02:07:45.291 --> 02:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>of efficiencies wherein Andre Ward or Kovalev is I think,</v>

4606
02:07:49.721 --> 02:07:51.160
<v Speaker 2>which I can't wait to see that fight.</v>

4607
02:07:51.161 --> 02:07:51.994
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

4608
02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Keep calling.</v>

4609
02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:57.680

4610
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:04.060
<v Speaker 2>There's some acrobatics taekwondo stuff that Cirque du Solei step when you have</v>

4611
02:08:04.061 --> 02:08:06.370
<v Speaker 2>those as forms and dudes will store like fucking,</v>

4612
02:08:06.371 --> 02:08:07.760
<v Speaker 2>they'll spin like flies.</v>

4613
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:09.280

4621
02:08:20.370 --> 02:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>If you could do it in the cage,</v>

4622
02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:23.253
<v Speaker 2>anybody could do it.</v>

5021
02:19:02.651 --> 02:19:03.130
<v Speaker 3>It's too,</v>

5022
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:04.410
<v Speaker 3>it's too perfect to be that.</v>

5023
02:19:04.450 --> 02:19:04.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

5024
02:19:04.961 --> 02:19:06.460
<v Speaker 3>They ride with their bike off in the ocean,</v>

5025
02:19:06.461 --> 02:19:06.780
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5026
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:07.990
<v Speaker 3>There's big John McCarthy.</v>

5027
02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:08.873
<v Speaker 3>Oh awesome.</v>

5028
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:12.040
<v Speaker 3>10 and go under it went under what?</v>

5029
02:19:12.090 --> 02:19:12.923
<v Speaker 3>GS?</v>

5030
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Fake suntanning.</v>

5031
02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:14.231
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5032
02:19:14.231 --> 02:19:15.250
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that shit anymore.</v>

5033
02:19:15.610 --> 02:19:17.080
<v Speaker 3>But did GSB of fake Tanner,</v>

5034
02:19:17.081 --> 02:19:18.250
<v Speaker 3>did he just get tanned a lot?</v>

5035
02:19:18.251 --> 02:19:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Because 10 makes your body actually produces vitamin D,</v>

5036
02:19:20.501 --> 02:19:23.370
<v Speaker 3>which helps you in terms talking about to your anabolic stage.</v>

5037
02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the industry,</v>

5038
02:19:24.551 --> 02:19:25.930
<v Speaker 3>the fake Sun 10 industry.</v>

5039
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Did it go under hold on Sam Anymore?</v>

5040
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.281
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

5041
02:19:28.281 --> 02:19:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Say That is true.</v>

5042
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Tanning,</v>

5043
02:19:30.590 --> 02:19:31.460
<v Speaker 1>tanning booths.</v>

5044
02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 1>When you see people tanning.</v>

5045
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5046
02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:33.650
<v Speaker 1>it's on,</v>

5047
02:19:33.650 --> 02:19:34.483
<v Speaker 1>it's all gone.</v>

5048
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:36.710
<v Speaker 1>There's an athletic benefit to that.</v>

5049
02:19:36.890 --> 02:19:38.240
<v Speaker 1>There's an actually athletic benefit.</v>

5050
02:19:38.390 --> 02:19:38.840
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

5051
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:41.240
<v Speaker 1>your body actually does produce vitamin D</v>

5052
02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:43.733
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

5053
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo called Maxwell.</v>

5054
02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I think Jill was talking about it.</v>

5055
02:19:49.191 --> 02:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>He said the GSP was at the center of this.</v>

5056
02:19:51.381 --> 02:19:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

5057
02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Steve Maxwell was talking about how Russian athletes have been doing this for a</v>

5058
02:19:54.591 --> 02:19:57.370
<v Speaker 1>long time and a lot of other athletes have figured out that Russian,</v>

5059
02:19:57.380 --> 02:19:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5060
02:19:58.210 --> 02:20:01.460
<v Speaker 1>we'll just do it in three machines are doing it stores.</v>

5061
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin D there is new research shows.</v>

5062
02:20:04.941 --> 02:20:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin D can dramatically increase athletic performance.</v>

5063
02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So I know for a second yes,</v>

5064
02:20:09.771 --> 02:20:12.770
<v Speaker 1>you can find them and see you get the same raise that you did from the sun.</v>

5065
02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Just intensified.</v>

5066
02:20:13.850 --> 02:20:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5067
02:20:14.430 --> 02:20:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

5068
02:20:15.210 --> 02:20:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5069
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:16.503
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

5070
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:17.563
<v Speaker 1>We did it for bolt.</v>

5071
02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:18.650
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be floating.</v>

5072
02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:19.513
<v Speaker 1>Who's a marketing.</v>

5073
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:21.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5074
02:20:21.051 --> 02:20:23.150
<v Speaker 1>GASB did it because he knew it could help us.</v>

5075
02:20:23.151 --> 02:20:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Performance for sure.</v>

5076
02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 1>He looked better,</v>

5077
02:20:24.470 --> 02:20:25.303
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

5078
02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:26.660
<v Speaker 1>he's very savvy.</v>

5079
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell is like,</v>

5080
02:20:28.761 --> 02:20:30.230
<v Speaker 1>he's got his thumb on the pulse.</v>

5081
02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean of the whole like athletic spectrum as far as like people strength and</v>

5082
02:20:34.491 --> 02:20:34.851
<v Speaker 1>conditioning,</v>

5083
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 1>little little hacks and little things that people do.</v>

5084
02:20:37.041 --> 02:20:38.330
<v Speaker 1>He's always got new shit.</v>

5085
02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:39.060
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

5086
02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:39.501
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

5087
02:20:39.501 --> 02:20:40.790
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly on top of it,</v>

5088
02:20:40.791 --> 02:20:41.990
<v Speaker 1>so when he was talking about that,</v>

5089
02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I take everything Maxwell says when it comes to like physical fitness and</v>

5090
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:47.540
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning.</v>

5091
02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:48.290
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5092
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:49.490
<v Speaker 1>he's a very responsible,</v>

5093
02:20:49.491 --> 02:20:49.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5094
02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's bullshitting.</v>

5095
02:20:50.481 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I think GSP was doing it for looks and maybe that,</v>

5096
02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but I am.</v>

5097
02:20:53.930 --> 02:20:54.681
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that.</v>

5098
02:20:54.681 --> 02:20:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the new thing.</v>

5099
02:20:55.611 --> 02:20:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Dudes are going to be coming in fucking Kansas.</v>

5100
02:20:58.311 --> 02:20:58.851
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

5101
02:20:58.851 --> 02:21:01.830
<v Speaker 1>They're going to look like they've seen of tape.</v>

5102
02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You could also take vitamin D,</v>

5103
02:21:05.001 --> 02:21:08.030
<v Speaker 1>especially d three and get probably pretty similar results to,</v>

5104
02:21:08.031 --> 02:21:09.110
<v Speaker 1>he just wouldn't get the Tan,</v>

5105
02:21:09.410 --> 02:21:10.910
<v Speaker 1>but you get both.</v>

5106
02:21:10.970 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 1>You can also could supplement with it.</v>

5107
02:21:13.071 --> 02:21:14.420
<v Speaker 1>You could take her on a Tan.</v>

5108
02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:15.201
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>

5109
02:21:15.201 --> 02:21:16.460
<v Speaker 1>You could do a lot of different things.</v>

5110
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:18.860
<v Speaker 1>So basically if you come in white and not tan,</v>

5111
02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you're not coming in at your full potential.</v>

5112
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:23.540
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily true because you can take supplementing vitamin D.</v>

5113
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.950
<v Speaker 1>See if you'd take it.</v>

5114
02:21:24.951 --> 02:21:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you get in d three d three is a hard one again man.</v>

5115
02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:30.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not 10 do you aint trying.</v>

5116
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.983
<v Speaker 1>I always 10</v>

5117
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:35.390
<v Speaker 1>for what?</v>

5118
02:21:35.391 --> 02:21:36.290
<v Speaker 1>An uncomfortable moment.</v>

5119
02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Biases.</v>

5120
02:21:37.090 --> 02:21:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Awkward Brian Collins Time.</v>

5121
02:21:38.810 --> 02:21:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It's time to start talking and I was going to say I'm waiting to</v>

5122
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:47.090
<v Speaker 1>get with this podcast is going to bring back the tanning</v>

5123
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:49.280
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

5124
02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not.</v>

5125
02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:53.960
<v Speaker 1>You guys are talking about millions of people listen to your shit.</v>

5126
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I was thinking when we created the floating industry.</v>

5127
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:58.243
<v Speaker 1>What were you gonna say?</v>

5128
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I was saying as you're talking,</v>

5129
02:22:01.101 --> 02:22:01.821
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking to myself,</v>

5130
02:22:01.821 --> 02:22:03.620
<v Speaker 1>as people move to higher latitudes,</v>

5131
02:22:04.850 --> 02:22:07.940
<v Speaker 1>they lost the melanin in their skin because they needed,</v>

5132
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:13.230
<v Speaker 1>they got less sun so you have to lose melanin in your skin so you can absorb the</v>

5133
02:22:14.031 --> 02:22:16.850
<v Speaker 1>ultraviolet rays that create vitamin D.</v>

5134
02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:18.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why Russians are so white.</v>

5135
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:18.651
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

5136
02:22:18.651 --> 02:22:20.520
<v Speaker 1>So as you get the skin cancer,</v>

5137
02:22:20.521 --> 02:22:21.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5138
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.920
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

5139
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:24.620
<v Speaker 1>That was even making it black people are actually,</v>

5140
02:22:24.621 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean why people are actually black</v>

5141
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:30.780
<v Speaker 3>people who just need less sun producing mother fuckers you lost.</v>

5142
02:22:30.781 --> 02:22:32.030
<v Speaker 3>That's evolutionary biology.</v>

5143
02:22:32.031 --> 02:22:33.270
<v Speaker 3>You racist bastards.</v>

5144
02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:35.490
<v Speaker 3>White people are just black.</v>

5145
02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:37.520
<v Speaker 3>True without the rest.</v>

5146
02:22:37.850 --> 02:22:39.860
<v Speaker 3>What was the rest that just need less fighting?</v>

5147
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Less sun essential vitamin D,</v>

5148
02:22:42.530 --> 02:22:43.200
<v Speaker 3>goddammit.</v>

5149
02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Well you lost me that white people are just black people.</v>

5150
02:22:48.390 --> 02:22:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm just telling you what my thoughts were,</v>

02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:25.053
<v Speaker 2>So how does,</v>

5259

02:26:25.691 --> 02:26:27.190
<v Speaker 2>was it used in this conversation?</v>

5261
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:28.211
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

5262
02:26:28.211 --> 02:26:31.390
<v Speaker 2>but I think he used it wrong and that's all right.</v>

5263
02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:33.851
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

5264
02:26:33.851 --> 02:26:36.940
<v Speaker 2>That shows you're a dad tried buddy.</v>

5265
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I had a brilliant thought Fox and they came out.</v>

5266
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:42.720
<v Speaker 2>It was he can you share it and then it's fun.</v>

5267
02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out what the real definition is.</v>

5268
02:26:44.351 --> 02:26:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Sublimate in the apparel business is now they got machines now that you can take</v>

5269
02:26:49.121 --> 02:26:51.250
<v Speaker 2>any picture you want and put it on material.</v>

5270
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.233
<v Speaker 2>It's not about like,</v>

5271
02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:52.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5272
02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:55.600
<v Speaker 2>like those old school graphic arts and supplement.</v>

5273
02:26:55.601 --> 02:26:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Then not sublimate their machines.</v>

5274
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:59.890
<v Speaker 2>A couple other</v>

5275
02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:03.220
<v Speaker 2>you see rash sublimate no.</v>

5276
02:27:03.221 --> 02:27:05.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of different definitions here.</v>

5277
02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Sexual when it appears in the apparel business,</v>

5278
02:27:08.350 --> 02:27:10.840
<v Speaker 2>it means make rash guards about,</v>

5279
02:27:10.930 --> 02:27:14.260
<v Speaker 2>you could take a picture and make a rash guard out of it through the sublimation</v>

5280
02:27:14.261 --> 02:27:15.094
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

5281
02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:16.843
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5282
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.400
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying is a crystal deposit on the car.</v>

5283
02:27:21.401 --> 02:27:22.121
<v Speaker 2>Just so amazing.</v>

5284
02:27:22.121 --> 02:27:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Now because of sublimation before sublimation you,</v>

5285
02:27:25.651 --> 02:27:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you had to do like graphic arts,</v>

5286
02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:30.730
<v Speaker 2>like to color type.</v>

5287
02:27:30.731 --> 02:27:34.480
<v Speaker 2>So logos you couldn't do right now you could do anything.</v>

5288
02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:38.230
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of different definitions because that one was sexual in the beginning.</v>

5289
02:27:39.210 --> 02:27:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

5290
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Why did we run out of noises we can make with our face?</v>

5291
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have words mean a bunch of different shit so people can sound smarter</v>

5292
02:27:47.831 --> 02:27:49.900
<v Speaker 2>than the other choices we make with our face.</v>

5293
02:27:49.901 --> 02:27:50.111
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5294
02:27:50.111 --> 02:27:50.771
<v Speaker 2>did we run out?</v>

5295
02:27:50.771 --> 02:27:50.981
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

5296
02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:53.170
<v Speaker 2>why do we have to use something for a bunch of different things?</v>

5297
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Like why should it be confusing?</v>

5298
02:27:55.001 --> 02:27:58.180
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to go to the dictionary and it's just one fucking definitely.</v>

5299
02:27:58.181 --> 02:27:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

5300
02:27:58.410 --> 02:27:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I fucking agree with that.</v>

5301
02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It's so exhausting.</v>

5302
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Fees,</v>

5303
02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you know like people like words like trite.</v>

5304
02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:06.970
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those words where people are also afraid to say they don't know</v>

5305
02:28:06.971 --> 02:28:07.804
<v Speaker 2>what it means.</v>

5306
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Try it.</v>

5307
02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:09.513
<v Speaker 2>Try it.</v>

5308
02:28:10.330 --> 02:28:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I just rolled with it.</v>

5309
02:28:11.321 --> 02:28:12.154
<v Speaker 2>You know I tried.</v>

5310
02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever used sublimate tried is like ridiculous.</v>

5311
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Nonsensical,</v>

5312
02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:19.430
<v Speaker 2>like not not important dude.</v>

5313
02:28:20.290 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what that means?</v>

5314
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5315
02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Cause I watched the Matt Lauer Tom Cruise interview.</v>

5316
02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:26.900
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

5317
02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:27.261
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

5318
02:28:27.261 --> 02:28:28.094
<v Speaker 2>you're being Glib.</v>

5319
02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:29.193
<v Speaker 2>Glib.</v>

5320
02:28:30.310 --> 02:28:32.630
<v Speaker 2>It's means like he's like dismissing.</v>

5321
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:33.583
<v Speaker 2>Oh gotcha.</v>

5322
02:28:33.930 --> 02:28:34.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5323
02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 2>like he's a,</v>

5324
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:36.560
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

5325
02:28:36.970 --> 02:28:39.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like a harsh dismissal.</v>

5326
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Insincere.</v>

5327
02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.113
<v Speaker 2>Thank you dude.</v>

5328
02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:42.830
<v Speaker 2>You're explaining what cahoots may cause.</v>

5329
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I thought it meant enemy a glip when we sang it like that.</v>

5330
02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:47.060
<v Speaker 2>You're saying he's being Glib,</v>

5331
02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:49.340
<v Speaker 2>but still I think he's saying he's being insincere.</v>

5332
02:28:49.341 --> 02:28:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he's saying who's being,</v>

5333
02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:52.450
<v Speaker 2>is this the actual word of it?</v>

5334
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:56.230
<v Speaker 2>The person speaking fluent and uh,</v>

5335
02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:58.450
<v Speaker 2>voluble but insincere in cow.</v>

5336
02:28:58.450 --> 02:28:58.961
<v Speaker 2>Let me show.</v>

5337
02:28:58.961 --> 02:28:59.631
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to say it,</v>

5338
02:28:59.631 --> 02:29:00.670
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it really means.</v>

5339
02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:01.773
<v Speaker 2>Shell.</v>

5340
02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5341
02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:04.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5342
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:06.110
<v Speaker 2>so I had it wrong.</v>

5343
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:07.430
<v Speaker 2>So glib would be B.</v>

5344
02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:08.770
<v Speaker 2>When you're being,</v>

5345
02:29:08.810 --> 02:29:13.520
<v Speaker 2>when you're not being almost reverential to something that requires Gravitas,</v>

5346
02:29:13.521 --> 02:29:15.620
<v Speaker 2>like us with Cyborg fighting railer yeah,</v>

5347
02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:16.011
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

5348
02:29:16.011 --> 02:29:16.371
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5349
02:29:16.371 --> 02:29:19.680
<v Speaker 2>but what we're for basketball is just like throwing a ball and to have,</v>

5350
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5351
02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:22.250
<v Speaker 2>a blowout recordings that makes a big Glib runs.</v>

5352
02:29:22.290 --> 02:29:26.120
<v Speaker 2>That's not a word that's in my frequent vocale vocabulary.</v>

5353
02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 2>If we used it,</v>

5354
02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:30.470
<v Speaker 2>it would be like if a girl says like you say son all the time,</v>

5355
02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:31.730
<v Speaker 2>so I say son all the time,</v>

5356
02:29:31.731 --> 02:29:32.564
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

5357
02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:34.150
<v Speaker 2>But if you use Glib,</v>

5358
02:29:34.151 --> 02:29:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I'd do that.</v>

5359
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Eddie hosted.</v>

5360
02:29:36.130 --> 02:29:36.300
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

5361
02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:37.720
<v Speaker 4>right now you're talking about two different things,</v>

5362
02:29:37.721 --> 02:29:39.630
<v Speaker 4>but that's what she went on down a depressant for.</v>

5363
02:29:39.850 --> 02:29:40.800
<v Speaker 4>But what happens?</v>

5364
02:29:40.801 --> 02:29:41.581
<v Speaker 4>The antidepressant,</v>

5365
02:29:41.581 --> 02:29:42.850
<v Speaker 4>all it does is mask the problem.</v>

5366
02:29:42.851 --> 02:29:45.600
<v Speaker 4>There's ways of vitamins and two extra educators,</v>

5367
02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

5368
02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:47.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that that isn't real,</v>

5369
02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:49.650
<v Speaker 4>but aren't there examples where it works?</v>

5370
02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:51.103
<v Speaker 4>You don't even,</v>

5371
02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:52.113
<v Speaker 4>you're granted,</v>

5372
02:29:52.170 --> 02:29:53.340
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know what religion is.</v>

5373
02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:55.620
<v Speaker 4>He started talking about chemical imbalance.</v>

5374
02:29:56.010 --> 02:29:59.640
<v Speaker 4>You have to evaluate and read the research papers on how they came up with these</v>

5375
02:29:59.641 --> 02:30:00.001
<v Speaker 4>theories.</v>

5376
02:30:00.001 --> 02:30:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Ma'Am,</v>

5377
02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:05.310
<v Speaker 2>he's telling us he's kind of schooling last year though.</v>

5378
02:30:05.610 --> 02:30:06.031
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>

5379
02:30:06.031 --> 02:30:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Matt Lauer's Malik was asking him real questions.</v>

5380
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Matt Lauer was asking him questions and he was saying,</v>

5381
02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:12.091
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5382
02:30:12.091 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 2>there are examples when ads are depressants,</v>

5383
02:30:13.650 --> 02:30:14.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not a fucking doctor.</v>

5384
02:30:14.731 --> 02:30:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise there examples when they work and save lives,</v>

5385
02:30:17.431 --> 02:30:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you fucking dummy stick to acting and ag and make them believe.</v>

5386
02:30:20.610 --> 02:30:21.391
<v Speaker 2>And that was a sign,</v>

5387
02:30:21.391 --> 02:30:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Todd,</v>

5388
02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:24.000
<v Speaker 2>that was him on a Scientology riff.</v>

5389
02:30:24.090 --> 02:30:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>

5390
02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:25.733

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Come on fuck cause he got a roll over.</v>

5392
02:30:28.621 --> 02:30:29.454
<v Speaker 2>You know you hate the guy.</v>

5393
02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:32.740
<v Speaker 2>If I'm being clear about Tom Cruise,</v>

5394
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:34.900
<v Speaker 2>don't bring up chem trails cause that's,</v>

5395
02:30:35.250 --> 02:30:35.870
<v Speaker 2>that's leave.</v>

5396
02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:37.680
<v Speaker 2>This is when he went full batshit crazy.</v>

5397
02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Tell you something about that guy.</v>

5403
02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:46.081
<v Speaker 2>I've met him twice.</v>

5404
02:30:46.081 --> 02:30:48.330
<v Speaker 2>He's the nicest human beings on the planet.</v>

5405
02:30:48.390 --> 02:30:48.780
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

5406
02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Are you a fan of Ritalin?</v>

5407
02:30:49.890 --> 02:30:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about them.</v>

5408
02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Ritalin.</v>

5409
02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5410
02:30:51.810 --> 02:30:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5411
02:30:52.240 --> 02:30:52.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5412
02:30:52.381 --> 02:30:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of any medication that I don't have to give to my children.</v>

5413
02:30:56.190 --> 02:30:57.870
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that there are,</v>

5414
02:30:58.290 --> 02:31:03.120
<v Speaker 2>there are certain drugs that are made by big pharmaceutical companies that save</v>

5415
02:31:03.121 --> 02:31:03.750
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

5416
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.871
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

5417
02:31:03.871 --> 02:31:05.760
<v Speaker 2>which lives better or beneficial?</v>

5418
02:31:05.850 --> 02:31:06.181
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5419
02:31:06.181 --> 02:31:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a pharmacologist,</v>

5420
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:10.230
<v Speaker 2>but I can give you examples of the things that I've seen with,</v>

5421
02:31:10.231 --> 02:31:10.680
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

5422
02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:11.850
<v Speaker 2>if you need antibiotics,</v>

5423
02:31:11.851 --> 02:31:12.730
<v Speaker 2>you need fucking science.</v>

5424
02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:14.740
<v Speaker 2>God Damn right section.</v>

5425
02:31:14.850 --> 02:31:15.960
<v Speaker 2>If she had staph infection,</v>

5426
02:31:15.961 --> 02:31:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you better be listening to fucking doctors and not listen to some food.</v>

5427
02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:24.053
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

5428
02:31:24.570 --> 02:31:25.590
<v Speaker 1>fuck that staff.</v>

5429
02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:29.280
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think there's a an either or.</v>

5430
02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of medications to do.</v>

5431
02:31:31.471 --> 02:31:32.011
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>

5432
02:31:32.011 --> 02:31:32.844
<v Speaker 1>a lot of good.</v>

5433
02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:36.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's also a lot of medications that pharmaceutical companies are</v>

5434
02:31:36.391 --> 02:31:40.290
<v Speaker 1>profiting off of people using them in ways that they don't need them.</v>

5435
02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:41.290
<v Speaker 1>But especially painkiller,</v>

5436
02:31:42.090 --> 02:31:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I grew that and a lot about this stuff.</v>

5437
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:44.221
<v Speaker 1>However you,</v>

5438
02:31:44.221 --> 02:31:44.881
<v Speaker 1>for you Brenda,</v>

5440
02:31:45.871 --> 02:31:46.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5441
02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:47.850
<v Speaker 1>With those goddamn painkillers.</v>

5442
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:48.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5443
02:31:48.211 --> 02:31:48.841
<v Speaker 1>there's a rumor.</v>

5444
02:31:48.841 --> 02:31:49.674
<v Speaker 1>I hesitate to Dylan.</v>

5445
02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:51.870
<v Speaker 1>You talked about it.</v>

5446
02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:53.270
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

5447
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:54.180
<v Speaker 1>that's scary shit man.</v>

5448
02:31:54.181 --> 02:31:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're a together guy like to hear that you got caught in the grip of</v>

5449
02:31:58.111 --> 02:31:58.944
<v Speaker 1>those fucking things.</v>

5450
02:31:58.950 --> 02:32:00.990
<v Speaker 1>The most addictive thing in the world they say,</v>

5451
02:32:00.991 --> 02:32:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and my doctor was trying to be cool and I was only supposed to have like 15.</v>

5452
02:32:04.121 --> 02:32:04.560
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5453
02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:05.790
<v Speaker 1>here's like 200 man.</v>

5454
02:32:05.790 --> 02:32:06.061
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

5455
02:32:06.061 --> 02:32:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5456
02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5457
02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:08.690
<v Speaker 1>explain what what she was saying.</v>

5458
02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5459
02:32:09.130 --> 02:32:09.910
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5460
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:12.420
<v Speaker 1>but explain why what they urge was our addictive.</v>

5461
02:32:13.410 --> 02:32:14.910
<v Speaker 1>So when you stop using them and you like,</v>

5462
02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:16.440
<v Speaker 1>you're like depressed,</v>

5463
02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:17.011
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5464
02:32:17.011 --> 02:32:17.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5465
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.780
<v Speaker 1>you feel itchy,</v>

5466
02:32:18.781 --> 02:32:19.870
<v Speaker 1>so then you keep taking me.</v>

5467
02:32:19.871 --> 02:32:22.290
<v Speaker 1>You just makes you feel better and they're not dependent on it.</v>

5468
02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So when I'd go out with my friends,</v>

5469
02:32:24.241 --> 02:32:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

5470
02:32:24.530 --> 02:32:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I knew I had 200 so I was like a mess.</v>

5471
02:32:26.491 --> 02:32:29.820
<v Speaker 1>We'll take one of those and not be all cranky and itching and pain.</v>

5472
02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:30.601
<v Speaker 1>I was taking one of those,</v>

5473
02:32:30.601 --> 02:32:32.340
<v Speaker 1>have one band that's a fun fucking night.</v>

5474
02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5475
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:34.051
<v Speaker 1>And then mixing.</v>

5476
02:32:34.051 --> 02:32:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I know every morning I'm just boom,</v>

5477
02:32:35.791 --> 02:32:36.271
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

5478
02:32:36.271 --> 02:32:36.691
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

5479
02:32:36.691 --> 02:32:37.110
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

5480
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Until my friend and brother like what the fuck are you doing?</v>

5481
02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:40.873
<v Speaker 1>And they took him from me.</v>

5482
02:32:41.220 --> 02:32:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to two pretty well known fighters.</v>

5483
02:32:43.390 --> 02:32:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Does anyone have any in here?</v>

5484
02:32:44.490 --> 02:32:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Why wait til I'm addicted to this fucking Conor Mcgregor,</v>

5485
02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz countdown thing they're doing right now.</v>

5486
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

5487
02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:51.801
<v Speaker 1>I think Connor,</v>

5488
02:32:51.801 --> 02:32:52.634
<v Speaker 1>when am I can't wait.</v>

5489
02:32:53.250 --> 02:32:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I think Connor wins a decision.</v>

5490
02:32:54.421 --> 02:32:55.110
<v Speaker 1>He might.</v>

5491
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.943
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

5492
02:32:56.280 --> 02:32:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5493
02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Nate might my get them.</v>

5494
02:32:59.160 --> 02:32:59.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5495
02:32:59.311 --> 02:33:00.180
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows man?</v>

5496
02:33:00.210 --> 02:33:02.970
<v Speaker 1>All we know is Nate got him the first time that I don't know.</v>

5497
02:33:02.971 --> 02:33:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you my educated opinion.</v>

5498
02:33:04.891 --> 02:33:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I think Conor Mcgregor wins by decision based off that first round and more</v>

5499
02:33:08.311 --> 02:33:09.144
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable training.</v>

5500
02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:09.421
<v Speaker 1>Bria.</v>

5501
02:33:09.421 --> 02:33:13.950
<v Speaker 1>But he will to about Nate Diaz with zero training coming in with 11 days and</v>

5502
02:33:13.951 --> 02:33:14.950
<v Speaker 1>owed five round fight.</v>

5503
02:33:14.970 --> 02:33:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Still one to five rounds,</v>

5504
02:33:17.610 --> 02:33:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but do you know how like more comfortable Nate is going to be with a full camp</v>

5505
02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:22.981
<v Speaker 1>then he's going to be,</v>

5506
02:33:22.981 --> 02:33:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would just assume that given,</v>

5507
02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:25.950
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

5508
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:29.130
<v Speaker 1>There's psychological variables that come into play,</v>

5509
02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:31.980
<v Speaker 1>especially when you deal with the amount of pressure that Nate is under now.</v>

5510
02:33:32.090 --> 02:33:34.860
<v Speaker 1>If you deal with the amount of press obligations,</v>

5511
02:33:34.861 --> 02:33:39.120
<v Speaker 1>he's now forced to a design done more than he's ever done for sure,</v>

5512
02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but he's also getting a good long stretch of time to know what kind of shape</v>

5513
02:33:45.061 --> 02:33:46.410
<v Speaker 1>he's got to get in before the fight.</v>

5514
02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:47.273
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5515
02:33:47.970 --> 02:33:48.803
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

5516
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:49.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>

5517
02:33:49.801 --> 02:33:54.480
<v Speaker 1>if you thought logically taking psychological considerations out logically would</v>

5518
02:33:54.481 --> 02:33:54.661
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

5519
02:33:54.661 --> 02:33:56.040
<v Speaker 1>well if you won the first fight,</v>

5520
02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:59.310
<v Speaker 1>if he's got more time to prepare in the second fight,</v>

5521
02:33:59.311 --> 02:34:00.710
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be even better than he wasn't.</v>

5522
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I could say the same thing for Connor though.</v>

5523
02:34:02.221 --> 02:34:04.680
<v Speaker 1>He could say he's never fight at one 70 before he,</v>

5524
02:34:04.681 --> 02:34:08.010
<v Speaker 1>all he did is still power punches that first round and kind of murked him the</v>

5525
02:34:08.011 --> 02:34:08.381
<v Speaker 1>second round.</v>

5526
02:34:08.381 --> 02:34:10.530
<v Speaker 1>He was in trouble cause he gas and got caught.</v>

5527
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.921
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

5528
02:34:10.921 --> 02:34:13.260
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't do in that first round for 25 minutes,</v>

5529
02:34:13.261 --> 02:34:14.094
<v Speaker 1>he wins that fight.</v>

5530
02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5531
02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Long time.</v>

5532
02:34:15.090 --> 02:34:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

5533
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It's your right.</v>

5534
02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at him saying you can play both sides.</v>

5535
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:19.000
<v Speaker 2>You know you can,</v>

5536
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you could say he was not without success in the first fight.</v>

5537
02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:25.900
<v Speaker 2>He had a very successful first round and he had a very successful minute plus of</v>

5538
02:34:25.901 --> 02:34:26.590
<v Speaker 2>the second round.</v>

5539
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Then he got in trouble and he got a,</v>

5540
02:34:28.301 --> 02:34:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Trump got in trouble and Nate started talking shit and then he started getting</v>

5541
02:34:31.841 --> 02:34:35.630
<v Speaker 2>gas and he started getting dinged and then he shot Fred tamped down and know</v>

5542
02:34:35.631 --> 02:34:38.420
<v Speaker 2>where the pay downs and right in the paydays if from Mcgregor wins because</v>

5543
02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:40.510
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to have a a three pay three p.</v>

5544
02:34:40.690 --> 02:34:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Well the pay day is if Mcgregor and Diaz have an old time shrub or Naca and</v>

5545
02:34:46.871 --> 02:34:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor wins.</v>

5546
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:48.161
<v Speaker 2>You had,</v>

5547
02:34:48.161 --> 02:34:50.620
<v Speaker 2>he has to win or he could have a fucking,</v>

5548
02:34:50.621 --> 02:34:53.500
<v Speaker 2>a real close decision loss to then you can't,</v>

5549
02:34:53.501 --> 02:34:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

5550
02:34:54.130 --> 02:34:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I am obsessed.</v>

5551
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I will not stop until I beat Nate Diaz.</v>

5552
02:34:58.930 --> 02:35:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause you lose two in a row and then you'll see it and go,</v>

5553
02:35:00.521 --> 02:35:01.001
<v Speaker 2>Nah Bitch,</v>

5554
02:35:01.001 --> 02:35:01.834
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and get down there.</v>

5555
02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:02.771
<v Speaker 2>They hit or not.</v>

5556
02:35:02.771 --> 02:35:05.500
<v Speaker 2>If you're a little white guy from Ireland named Connor Mcgregor,</v>

5557
02:35:05.501 --> 02:35:06.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</v>

5558
02:35:06.941 --> 02:35:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Mother fucker won't have a car.</v>

5559
02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:10.931
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5560
02:35:10.931 --> 02:35:11.860

5566
02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not your typical Leprechaun.</v>

5567
02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:20.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a different number.</v>

5568
02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:21.793

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5572
02:35:24.730 --> 02:35:25.990
<v Speaker 2>He dominated the first two rounds.</v>

5573
02:35:25.991 --> 02:35:26.671
<v Speaker 2>Three rounds a little bit.</v>

5574
02:35:26.671 --> 02:35:27.580
<v Speaker 2>This is the main event.</v>

5575
02:35:27.581 --> 02:35:30.410
<v Speaker 2>We haven't talked about single fucking fight other than a few random stuff.</v>

5576
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:31.623

5654
02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:37.700
<v Speaker 1>a freak specimen.</v>

02:37:37.850 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if he was going to have to fight Cyborg.</v>

5656
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:41.420
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about Ray Lewis,</v>

5657
02:37:41.460 --> 02:37:42.141
<v Speaker 1>like Ray Lewis.</v>

5658
02:37:42.141 --> 02:37:43.400
<v Speaker 1>We know he is a wrestler,</v>

5659
02:37:43.401 --> 02:37:45.650
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know how much martial arts experience he had.</v>

5660
02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:47.810
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

5661
02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.130
<v Speaker 1>But Herschel Walker,</v>

5662
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker at whatever he is now for 82 years old to 1590 9.9% of the</v>

5663
02:37:56.301 --> 02:37:58.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking planet we're going to run.</v>

5664
02:37:58.320 --> 02:37:58.821
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

5665
02:37:58.821 --> 02:38:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You better except for every guy in the light heavyweight division on the roster</v>

5666
02:38:03.531 --> 02:38:04.550
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC heavyweight.</v>

5667
02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5668
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Even worse,</v>

5669
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:08.690
<v Speaker 1>he comes to the UFC that everyone's go wow.</v>

5670
02:38:08.691 --> 02:38:10.820
<v Speaker 1>But he's 50 years old.</v>

5671
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It's more than 50.</v>

5672
02:38:12.021 --> 02:38:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he's 52.</v>

5673
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the biggest freaks of all time.</v>

5674
02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:15.523
<v Speaker 1>You'll 50.</v>

5675
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:17.420
<v Speaker 1>He might show him sprinting.</v>

5676
02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Show him with a lot of guys in the UFC.</v>

5677
02:38:19.521 --> 02:38:24.521
<v Speaker 1>So show him Ryan the hunter in the UFC when he was world class speed.</v>

5678
02:38:24.651 --> 02:38:25.640
<v Speaker 1>He had world class Pete,</v>

5679
02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:26.650

5685
02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Think about some uh,</v>

5686
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:39.740
<v Speaker 1>questionable heavyweight performance between a guy that's nowhere near the top</v>

5687
02:38:39.741 --> 02:38:40.400
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

02:38:41.691 --> 02:38:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't think that Hershel Walker could fuck up some new guy?</v>

5691
02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:46.673
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5692
02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:48.440
<v Speaker 1>not at 50 shows.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't watch it.</v>

5702
02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:08.320

<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't never have fights here.</v>

5707
02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:16.100
<v Speaker 1>It's faster,</v>

5711
02:39:19.310 --> 02:39:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that right now.</v>

5712
02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:24.080
<v Speaker 1>The heavy weights would eat him alive.</v>

5713
02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:24.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5714

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5716
02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:25.810
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweights.</v>

5717
02:39:25.810 --> 02:39:28.910
<v Speaker 1>But they're lucky he didn't start this shit about 20 years ago.</v>

5718
02:39:28.911 --> 02:39:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

5719
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5720
02:39:29.721 --> 02:39:31.880
<v Speaker 1>if Bo Jackson decided to MMA,</v>

5721
02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:32.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5722
02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:34.670
<v Speaker 1>she can't fucking Dick the Jupiter.</v>

5723
02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:35.773
<v Speaker 1>He's a month.</v>

5724
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:41.230
<v Speaker 1>There are some Herschel Walker at 47 I think he was 48 here.</v>

5725
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:42.583
<v Speaker 1>Look at his body.</v>

5726
02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Was He 48 here?</v>

5727
02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5728
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:46.370
<v Speaker 1>this is 48 here defending the leg lock.</v>

5729
02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Beat your ass.</v>

5730
02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Just</v>

5731
02:39:52.610 --> 02:39:53.361
<v Speaker 1>goodness.</v>

5732
02:39:53.361 --> 02:39:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Defense man.</v>

5733
02:39:54.050 --> 02:39:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Look at this spot around 40 and leave behind his back</v>

5734
02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and he's a super athlete,</v>

5735
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the best athletes of all time.</v>

5736
02:40:01.790 --> 02:40:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of us sort of underestimate the difference between the elite of</v>

5737
02:40:06.471 --> 02:40:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the elites and irregular cumin trained.</v>

5738
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:11.870
<v Speaker 1>You look how he just rag tall that due to the ground.</v>

5739
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:13.063
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5740
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:14.820
<v Speaker 1>At too tired either.</v>

5741
02:40:14.821 --> 02:40:15.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like,</v>

5742
02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:16.111
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

5743
02:40:16.111 --> 02:40:17.220
<v Speaker 1>he's a stud.</v>

5744
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:18.960
<v Speaker 1>He's such a super athlete.</v>

5745
02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

5746
02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:21.510
<v Speaker 1>There's the 25 years ago.</v>

5747
02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Amazing athlete.</v>

5748
02:40:22.531 --> 02:40:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he win a gold medal in the bobsled?</v>

5749
02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Laugh for a moment.</v>

5750
02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's think for a moment.</v>

5751
02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:32.720
<v Speaker 1>What if custom motto existed in 2016 and he found a young 13 year old Mike Tyson</v>

5752
02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:37.770
<v Speaker 1>and brought him to for Rasa Hobby.</v>

5753
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5754
02:40:38.911 --> 02:40:39.721
<v Speaker 1>they'd be amazing.</v>

5755
02:40:39.721 --> 02:40:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Brought him to Matt Hume because freak athletes,</v>

5756
02:40:43.470 --> 02:40:45.960
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you get a dude like you remember when Mike Tice used to hit</v>

5757
02:40:45.961 --> 02:40:46.794
<v Speaker 1>that heavy bag?</v>

5758
02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:52.740
<v Speaker 1>You will never saw earthly Mike Tyson couldn't handle Bo Jacksons jock strap if</v>

5759
02:40:54.991 --> 02:40:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you get Bo Jackson when he's 13 yeah.</v>

5760
02:40:57.350 --> 02:40:57.871
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

5761
02:40:57.871 --> 02:40:59.730
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about different endeavors.</v>

5762
02:40:59.850 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what Mike Tyson's athletic ability would have been if he had been</v>

5763
02:41:03.151 --> 02:41:03.990
<v Speaker 1>playing football.</v>

5764
02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5765
02:41:04.211 --> 02:41:08.610
<v Speaker 1>we do know is what it was when he got into boxing and it's almost better than</v>

5766
02:41:08.611 --> 02:41:10.740
<v Speaker 1>anybody ever in a lot of ways.</v>

5767
02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he was so short and he had this crazy style of bobbing and</v>

5768
02:41:14.461 --> 02:41:18.570
<v Speaker 1>weaving and ripping ridiculous fucking power and speed punches at you.</v>

5769
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.171
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

5770
02:41:19.171 --> 02:41:19.381
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

5771
02:41:19.381 --> 02:41:21.600
<v Speaker 1>who's the best guy that he beat?</v>

5772
02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably Larry Holmes,</v>

5773
02:41:23.671 --> 02:41:26.700
<v Speaker 1>but Larry Holmes was out of his prime to Leon Spinks or excuse me,</v>

5774
02:41:26.701 --> 02:41:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Michael Spinks washed this thug dude.</v>

5775
02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying compared to the other heavyweights,</v>

5776
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:30.751
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's the,</v>

5777
02:41:30.751 --> 02:41:31.680
<v Speaker 1>he's the best heavyweight.</v>

5778
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:32.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5779
02:41:32.041 --> 02:41:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it was all before he went to jail,</v>

5780
02:41:33.781 --> 02:41:34.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5781
02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:35.203
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

5782
02:41:35.850 --> 02:41:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Best guys beat an old Larry Holmes or Spinks back to think of,</v>

5783
02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:42.000
<v Speaker 1>it's the way he ran through the division.</v>

5784
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:42.720
<v Speaker 1>He changed.</v>

5785
02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:43.590
<v Speaker 1>He was in the pocket.</v>

5786
02:41:44.250 --> 02:41:47.400
<v Speaker 1>But you look at like and Lennox Lewis on banner Holyfield much more impressive.</v>

5787
02:41:47.430 --> 02:41:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

5788
02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:48.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5789
02:41:48.211 --> 02:41:49.200
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more about it.</v>

5790
02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately when Lennox Lewis,</v>

5791
02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:54.090
<v Speaker 1>when he beats Tyson Tyson,</v>

5792
02:41:54.690 --> 02:41:55.250
<v Speaker 1>he beat,</v>

5793
02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:55.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5794
02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:55.751
<v Speaker 1>he's those,</v>

5795
02:41:55.751 --> 02:41:57.730
<v Speaker 1>those old school boxing shoes he used to wear.</v>

5796
02:41:57.980 --> 02:41:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But when he'd be Tyson,</v>

5797
02:41:59.101 --> 02:42:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Tyson was an older man and you know,</v>

5798
02:42:01.170 --> 02:42:03.120
<v Speaker 1>he had been in the game a long fucking time.</v>

5799
02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't the same.</v>

5800
02:42:04.351 --> 02:42:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Once he was disconnected more and more from the original customers.</v>

5801
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at the body of work compared to a van or Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.</v>

5802
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:12.780
<v Speaker 1>If you look just on paper,</v>

5803
02:42:13.350 --> 02:42:15.360
<v Speaker 1>my budget number has the scare factor.</v>

5804
02:42:15.390 --> 02:42:16.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what we all remember.</v>

5805
02:42:16.441 --> 02:42:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Remember Brendon,</v>

5806
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:20.700
<v Speaker 1>he went out there and fucked everybody up in the first round.</v>

5807
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else's.</v>

5808
02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:23.683
<v Speaker 1>He didn't pee.</v>

5809
02:42:25.290 --> 02:42:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Fucking had the fear where they fought Mike Tyson.</v>

5810
02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:28.740
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking,</v>

5811
02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:30.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we say he's the best.</v>

5812
02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:31.350
<v Speaker 1>That's why you say he's the best.</v>

5813
02:42:31.351 --> 02:42:32.520
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at it on paper,</v>

5814
02:42:32.521 --> 02:42:33.341
<v Speaker 1>he's really not.</v>

5815
02:42:33.341 --> 02:42:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And they were scared was cause he was going through everybody with one fucking</v>

5816
02:42:36.991 --> 02:42:37.620
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>

5817
02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:39.080
<v Speaker 1>He was crushing the vendor.</v>

5818
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Highfield wasn't scared.</v>

5819
02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:40.670
<v Speaker 1>People were,</v>

5820
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:41.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5821
02:42:41.050 --> 02:42:41.431
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

5822
02:42:41.431 --> 02:42:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Buster Douglas when,</v>

5823
02:42:42.301 --> 02:42:43.134
<v Speaker 1>and scared and true.</v>

5824
02:42:43.770 --> 02:42:44.603
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>

5825
02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:44.921
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

5826
02:42:44.921 --> 02:42:45.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5827
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.270
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at Evander Holyfield's career,</v>

5828
02:42:48.390 --> 02:42:49.130
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>

5829
02:42:49.130 --> 02:42:51.120
<v Speaker 1>he's a gold and shocking the world.</v>

5830
02:42:51.121 --> 02:42:51.954
<v Speaker 1>Like Mike Tyson,</v>

5831
02:42:52.140 --> 02:42:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson was just a GP.</v>

5832
02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson blew up paper view people.</v>

5833
02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:00.570
<v Speaker 1>They were pissed that he would not do doubt in the first round,</v>

5834
02:43:00.571 --> 02:43:02.520
<v Speaker 1>but just know that nobody's,</v>

5835
02:43:02.521 --> 02:43:03.210
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it,</v>

5836
02:43:03.210 --> 02:43:04.060
<v Speaker 1>that was the problem.</v>

5837
02:43:04.061 --> 02:43:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Like book,</v>

5838
02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to knock them out on the first row.</v>

5839
02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:08.700
<v Speaker 1>That was the proper people were pissed off with the paper view.</v>

5840
02:43:08.970 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 1>My president is going to beat him in the first round and we're going to lose</v>

5841
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:12.431
<v Speaker 2>our money.</v>

5842
02:43:12.431 --> 02:43:13.264
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

5843
02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.910
<v Speaker 2>That was a problem he created.</v>

5844
02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's if you'd like.</v>

5845
02:43:17.460 --> 02:43:17.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5846
02:43:17.770 --> 02:43:17.951
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5847
02:43:17.951 --> 02:43:21.660
<v Speaker 2>He's got everybody up and people were scared shitless.</v>

5848
02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:26.020
<v Speaker 2>It was no other that provoked that.</v>

5849
02:43:27.690 --> 02:43:27.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5850
02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:28.713
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

5851
02:43:28.810 --> 02:43:29.291
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

5852
02:43:29.291 --> 02:43:30.640
<v Speaker 2>He was a special force.</v>

5853
02:43:30.641 --> 02:43:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So scary side on earth.</v>

5854
02:43:31.961 --> 02:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>But listen with with Brenda is talking about is like hindsight like so when</v>

5855
02:43:35.921 --> 02:43:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Brendan is talking about it now when you look back and you think about the guys</v>

5856
02:43:39.221 --> 02:43:40.054
<v Speaker 2>he beat,</v>

5857
02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:43.900
<v Speaker 2>it's very arguable that holy field was the superior fighter.</v>

5858
02:43:43.901 --> 02:43:46.030
<v Speaker 2>He beat him twice and we always want to say,</v>

5859
02:43:46.031 --> 02:43:46.181
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5860
02:43:46.181 --> 02:43:48.610
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't the same guy as when Tyson,</v>

5861
02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:50.333
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't matter.</v>

5862
02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:51.213
<v Speaker 2>He's still beat him.</v>

5863
02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:53.170
<v Speaker 2>When they got together and holy field,</v>

5864
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you got to put him on a higher level because he was able to maintain his</v>

5865
02:43:56.831 --> 02:43:59.590
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm for fighting way longer than most folks.</v>

5866
02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Natural cruiserweight.</v>

5867
02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:03.040
<v Speaker 2>So many fights like,</v>

5868
02:44:03.041 --> 02:44:03.311
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

5869
02:44:03.311 --> 02:44:05.560
<v Speaker 2>we're really low and amateurs,</v>

5870
02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:06.331
<v Speaker 2>amateurs,</v>

5871
02:44:06.331 --> 02:44:07.470
<v Speaker 2>man who won the gold,</v>

5872
02:44:08.050 --> 02:44:10.270
<v Speaker 2>make the team look at the body of work.</v>

5873
02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:12.190
<v Speaker 2>His career was amazing.</v>

5874
02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:13.150
<v Speaker 2>The fights he was in,</v>

5875
02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:16.180
<v Speaker 2>but Tyson was known for going through.</v>

5876
02:44:16.181 --> 02:44:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

5877
02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:17.670
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean he's a better fighter.</v>

5878
02:44:19.030 --> 02:44:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to give it to a van or calls a vandal beat him twice,</v>

5879
02:44:22.390 --> 02:44:25.630
<v Speaker 2>but Tyson is one of the all time greats and they're both all time greats.</v>

5880
02:44:25.631 --> 02:44:25.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5881
02:44:25.901 --> 02:44:28.330
<v Speaker 2>we're super lucky to have watched those guys fight.</v>

5882
02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

5883
02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:34.020
<v Speaker 2>You know Tyson and Holyfield x factor because he's so scared of the stock in</v>

5884
02:44:34.271 --> 02:44:34.930
<v Speaker 2>these guys out.</v>

5885
02:44:34.930 --> 02:44:35.231
<v Speaker 2>Boys,</v>

5886
02:44:35.231 --> 02:44:36.190
<v Speaker 2>can we go here we go.</v>

5887
02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:37.033
<v Speaker 2>To manifest.</v>

5888
02:44:37.390 --> 02:44:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Tyson was more exciting,</v>

5889
02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:38.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5890
02:44:38.670 --> 02:44:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's 10 boy doesn't make you better fight.</v>

5891
02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Here's Harrison.</v>

5892
02:44:41.621 --> 02:44:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Yair Rodriguez,</v>

5893
02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Tyson main event.</v>

5894
02:44:44.681 --> 02:44:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Look at that perfect hook.</v>

5895
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:47.703
<v Speaker 2>It's better than me.</v>

5896
02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:49.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5897
02:44:49.271 --> 02:44:51.160
<v Speaker 2>but you always got to wonder like what was,</v>

5898
02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:54.910
<v Speaker 2>what was the training like for Tyson then in comparison to the training when he</v>

5899
02:44:54.911 --> 02:44:55.360
<v Speaker 2>was young?</v>

5900
02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:56.590
<v Speaker 2>What was the mindset like?</v>

5901
02:44:56.810 --> 02:44:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5902
02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that a really elite fighter could only maintain a certain</v>

5903
02:45:02.561 --> 02:45:05.200
<v Speaker 2>number of Rpms when they're just smashing people.</v>

5904
02:45:05.410 --> 02:45:07.690
<v Speaker 2>They can only maintain that for a certain amount of time.</v>

5905
02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:08.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5906
02:45:08.711 --> 02:45:09.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5907
02:45:09.130 --> 02:45:09.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5908
02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:11.020
<v Speaker 2>the password prove you right.</v>

5909
02:45:11.021 --> 02:45:11.531
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5910
02:45:11.531 --> 02:45:12.490
<v Speaker 2>You look get all fighters,</v>

5911
02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:15.400
<v Speaker 2>but we don't realize it when they're going through it.</v>

5912
02:45:15.401 --> 02:45:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at Ronda,</v>

5913
02:45:16.571 --> 02:45:16.901
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

5914
02:45:16.901 --> 02:45:17.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5915
02:45:17.021 --> 02:45:17.854
<v Speaker 2>that's what she does.</v>

5916
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:19.240
<v Speaker 2>You look at junior dos Santos,</v>

5917
02:45:19.241 --> 02:45:20.350
<v Speaker 2>you look at cane like certain,</v>

5918
02:45:20.470 --> 02:45:21.161
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

5919
02:45:21.161 --> 02:45:21.851
<v Speaker 2>Then you step back,</v>

5920
02:45:21.851 --> 02:45:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

5921
02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:22.421
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5922
02:45:22.421 --> 02:45:23.254
<v Speaker 2>that was the Ra.</v>

5923
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:24.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the run there.</v>

5924
02:45:24.970 --> 02:45:26.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the greatest Rev.</v>

5925
02:45:26.101 --> 02:45:28.510
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see him make a call right now as it's happening.</v>

5926
02:45:28.511 --> 02:45:29.620
<v Speaker 2>You really don't notice.</v>

5927
02:45:29.650 --> 02:45:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about that the other days.</v>

5928
02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:33.180
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

5929
02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:33.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5930
02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:36.490
<v Speaker 2>you're accustomed to it and you think that's just what they do and then they</v>

5931
02:45:36.491 --> 02:45:37.240
<v Speaker 2>lose like two or three.</v>

5932
02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:37.720
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

5933
02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:38.553
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

5934
02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:39.310
<v Speaker 2>That was his,</v>

5935
02:45:39.310 --> 02:45:39.911
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

5936
02:45:39.911 --> 02:45:41.230
<v Speaker 2>That was the run until six,</v>

5937
02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:41.771
<v Speaker 2>seven fights.</v>

5938
02:45:41.771 --> 02:45:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Which it was pure greatness.</v>

5939
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Music is like that too.</v>

5940
02:45:43.991 --> 02:45:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Like bands that would come out with their new album but their new album,</v>

5941
02:45:47.351 --> 02:45:48.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're old shit.</v>

5942
02:45:49.090 --> 02:45:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Their new album is no like the old chick.</v>

5943
02:45:51.070 --> 02:45:54.010
<v Speaker 2>But then that new shit is old shit.</v>

5944
02:45:55.410 --> 02:45:56.243
<v Speaker 2>Fight,</v>

5945
02:45:56.890 --> 02:45:57.723
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

5946
02:45:58.150 --> 02:46:00.010
<v Speaker 2>washed our rig is how he's better.</v>

5947
02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Rodriguez is going to reduce is to Sarah's is fucking threatened him a few</v>

5948
02:46:04.841 --> 02:46:05.360
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

5949
02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.510
<v Speaker 2>This is a heavy favorite midsummer to spinning this.</v>

5950
02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:08.980
<v Speaker 2>He shows getting back fast.</v>

5951
02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:09.833
<v Speaker 2>Nah.</v>

5952
02:46:09.910 --> 02:46:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh Cause Harris has to rant.</v>

5953
02:46:11.370 --> 02:46:12.203
<v Speaker 2>He's um,</v>

5954
02:46:12.530 --> 02:46:13.520
<v Speaker 2>he's athletic but he's,</v>

5955
02:46:13.521 --> 02:46:14.150
<v Speaker 2>he's too,</v>

5956
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5957
02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:15.553
<v Speaker 2>for sure out.</v>

5958
02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:16.850
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have the fundamentals.</v>

5959
02:46:16.851 --> 02:46:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that Rodrigo,</v>

5960
02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:18.893
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5961
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:22.483
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.</v>

5962
02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:23.660
<v Speaker 2>It makes big mistakes.</v>

5963
02:46:23.661 --> 02:46:24.494
<v Speaker 2>His hands are down.</v>

5964
02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:27.260
<v Speaker 2>He's been getting tagged and then wanting to fight with her.</v>

5965
02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Hands down.</v>

5966
02:46:28.050 --> 02:46:29.060
<v Speaker 2>No Rodriguez,</v>

5967
02:46:29.090 --> 02:46:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Rodriguez Kellen on this when they're close read because his hands are up.</v>

5968
02:46:35.810 --> 02:46:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Defense made a better default is excellent.</v>

5969
02:46:38.781 --> 02:46:39.470
<v Speaker 2>But Dude,</v>

5970
02:46:39.470 --> 02:46:40.760
<v Speaker 2>cause Sarah's is very good,</v>

5971
02:46:40.761 --> 02:46:41.571
<v Speaker 2>very athletic,</v>

5972
02:46:41.571 --> 02:46:42.141
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>

5973
02:46:42.141 --> 02:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5974
02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:42.790
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

5975
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:43.220
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

5976
02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:44.150
<v Speaker 2>he needs Brian towns.</v>

5977
02:46:44.151 --> 02:46:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Workshops got fundamental.</v>

5978
02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:47.060
<v Speaker 2>He's not as good fundamentally.</v>

5979
02:46:47.061 --> 02:46:48.950
<v Speaker 2>He's just not as Rodriguez.</v>

5980
02:46:48.951 --> 02:46:50.240
<v Speaker 2>He's just not watch your mouth.</v>

5981
02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

5982
02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I would disagree with you.</v>

5983
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:53.260
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

5984
02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I would say because Sarah's is very underrated,</v>

5985
02:46:55.341 --> 02:46:57.200
<v Speaker 2>is very crafty in our athletic,</v>

5986
02:46:57.201 --> 02:46:58.880
<v Speaker 2>very crafty and watching lenses.</v>

5987
02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:02.300
<v Speaker 2>He's very comfortable in they Brian Rodriguez a heavy favorite.</v>

5988
02:47:02.301 --> 02:47:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5989
02:47:02.450 --> 02:47:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

5990
02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:06.650
<v Speaker 2>My point is be this beautiful leg lock attempt here.</v>

5991
02:47:06.651 --> 02:47:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Drugas it's not,</v>

5992
02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:09.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that he's not going to win.</v>

5993
02:47:09.351 --> 02:47:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm just seeing you like you saying that it doesn't have good fundamentals.</v>

5994
02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being insulting to concerns.</v>

5995
02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:16.320
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is anything,</v>

5996
02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:21.400
<v Speaker 2>I just watched their first one minute guys and I saw and I saw him make big</v>

5997
02:47:21.981 --> 02:47:25.010
<v Speaker 2>mistakes where he's coming in and throwing and being really athletic but getting</v>

5998
02:47:25.011 --> 02:47:26.510
<v Speaker 2>caught in the face by a,</v>

5999
02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:28.520
<v Speaker 2>by a guy who was a really a better counter punch.</v>

6000
02:47:28.521 --> 02:47:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't see that and I fought for it.</v>

6001
02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6002
02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Well I did cause you weren't watching.</v>

02:48:43.641 --> 02:48:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Look at the fundamental grip.</v>

6049
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:49.630
<v Speaker 2>We're like a bunch of children with the example of how not to behave when you're</v>

6050
02:48:49.731 --> 02:48:50.990
<v Speaker 2>on a live podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's so true.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it's an issue for women.</v>

6055
02:48:58.581 --> 02:48:59.001
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>at least as far as what I read,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jamie with the new regulation is about women's clothing.</v>

6059
02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:10.510
<v Speaker 2>If I just made that up like Joe doesn't say anything about women,</v>

02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:24.510
<v Speaker 2>because of wardrobe malfunctions.</v>

6245
02:54:38.270 --> 02:54:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be really honest about this.</v>

6246
02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6247
02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:43.930

6248
02:54:43.931 --> 02:54:44.350
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

6252
02:54:47.591 --> 02:54:50.410
<v Speaker 2>You are defending your position and I got to keep,</v>

6253
02:54:50.411 --> 02:54:53.050
<v Speaker 2>depending on what we now know that Brenda knows more than Nope,</v>

6254
02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:53.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to die.</v>

02:54:54.810 --> 02:54:55.331
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6256
02:54:55.331 --> 02:54:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And the just,</v>

6257
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Sarah's is obviously handling himself in his fight against one of the most</v>

6258
02:54:59.201 --> 02:55:00.610
<v Speaker 2>dangerous guys in the division.</v>

02:56:34.681 --> 02:56:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's fried chicken is in somehow or any way racist.</v>

6318
02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should breathe freely.</v>

6319
02:56:38.661 --> 02:56:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy a drink.</v>

6320

02:56:47.381 --> 02:56:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being cool too.</v>

6326
02:56:49.730 --> 02:56:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I had some buttermilk fried chicken in a restaurant in Atlanta.</v>

6327
02:56:53.031 --> 02:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

6328
02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:55.010
<v Speaker 2>it was so good.</v>

6329
02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:56.113
<v Speaker 2>That's not racist,</v>

6330
02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:59.180
<v Speaker 2>so God damn good ahead it two years ago and I never forgot it.</v>

6331
02:56:59.181 --> 02:57:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Fried Chicken's incredible.</v>

6332
02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:02.313
<v Speaker 2>Good</v>

6333
02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:06.470
<v Speaker 2>white people make chick filet chicken,</v>

6334
02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:08.910
<v Speaker 2>but this wasn't chick filet chest.</v>

6335
02:57:09.250 --> 02:57:11.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a gourmet restaurant made fried chicken.</v>

6336
02:57:11.991 --> 02:57:12.681
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

6337
02:57:12.681 --> 02:57:13.460
<v Speaker 2>The old school way.</v>

6338
02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:14.360
<v Speaker 2>While I was just thinking in my head,</v>

6339
02:57:14.361 --> 02:57:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I was having a conversation again,</v>

6340
02:57:15.321 --> 02:57:17.330
<v Speaker 2>but KFC,</v>

6341
02:57:17.330 --> 02:57:17.331
<v Speaker 2>Popeye's,</v>

6342
02:57:17.331 --> 02:57:17.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6343
02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:17.980

6344
02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:18.620
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

6345
02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6346
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:20.680
<v Speaker 2>And then chick fil A's owned by Mormons.</v>

6347
02:57:20.690 --> 02:57:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Is this why they shut down the Mormon?</v>

6348
02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:23.001
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

6349
02:57:23.001 --> 02:57:25.430
<v Speaker 2>there's some kind of crazy Christians chicken too.</v>

6350
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:26.623
<v Speaker 2>But how about this?</v>

6351
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:28.080
<v Speaker 2>How about there's a,</v>

6352
02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to mention though.</v>

6353
02:57:29.250 --> 02:57:29.541
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you guys are missing some great fighters.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

6357
02:57:37.410 --> 02:57:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had that chicken bag?</v>

6358
02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Get at the ARC light with watermelon?</v>

6359
02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Have a hat.</v>

6360
02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:43.613
<v Speaker 2>I've lived it.</v>

6361
02:57:43.730 --> 02:57:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6362
02:57:44.050 --> 02:57:44.310
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

6363
02:57:44.310 --> 02:57:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Left hand by</v>

6364
02:57:47.270 --> 02:57:48.103
<v Speaker 2>Barb.</v>

6365
02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Racist at Arc light.</v>

6366
02:57:50.350 --> 02:57:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I Riggins is no joke.</v>

6367
02:57:52.580 --> 02:57:53.413
<v Speaker 2>I sure haven't.</v>

6368
02:57:54.850 --> 02:57:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Rodriquez a style they close on Sunday at site.</v>

6369
02:57:58.730 --> 02:58:00.620
<v Speaker 2>They closed on Sundays because Christian beliefs.</v>

6370
02:58:00.890 --> 02:58:01.530
<v Speaker 2>What about us?</v>

6371
02:58:01.530 --> 02:58:02.220
<v Speaker 2>What about his style?</v>

6372
02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:04.890
<v Speaker 1>His style requires a lot of exploding.</v>

6373
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Like his style is all like leaping forward and leaping back and moving forward</v>

6374
02:58:11.101 --> 02:58:11.821
<v Speaker 1>fast is,</v>

6375
02:58:11.821 --> 02:58:14.460
<v Speaker 1>has a lot of like serious explosions.</v>

6376
02:58:14.461 --> 02:58:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to watch what is,</v>

6377
02:58:15.650 --> 02:58:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>

6378
02:58:16.010 --> 02:58:16.561
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

6379
02:58:16.561 --> 02:58:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

6380
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.521
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

6381
02:58:17.521 --> 02:58:17.961
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm,</v>

6382
02:58:17.961 --> 02:58:18.870
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is like,</v>

6383
02:58:18.871 --> 02:58:23.820
<v Speaker 1>it takes a really high level of fitness to fight this style because he's doing</v>

6384
02:58:23.821 --> 02:58:25.620
<v Speaker 1>essentially like wrestling.</v>

6385
02:58:25.621 --> 02:58:28.260
<v Speaker 1>But like with all these plyometrics built into it,</v>

6386
02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:28.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6387
02:58:28.861 --> 02:58:30.720
<v Speaker 1>he's like leaping forward and backward.</v>

6388
02:58:30.721 --> 02:58:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6389
02:58:31.250 --> 02:58:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6390
02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Where's Alex Dream?</v>

6391
02:58:32.881 --> 02:58:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Remember this isn't Utah,</v>

6392
02:58:34.171 --> 02:58:36.240
<v Speaker 1>so the level elevations high,</v>

6393
02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but Rodriguez comes from Albuquerque so it's not gonna be as high as</v>

6394
02:58:40.201 --> 02:58:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Albuquerque.</v>

6395
02:58:40.770 --> 02:58:43.530
<v Speaker 1>So I would assume later in rounds is going to favor Rodriguez.</v>

6396
02:58:43.560 --> 02:58:44.393
<v Speaker 1>If you think about that.</v>

6397
02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:46.560
<v Speaker 1>He's also been t and off.</v>

6398
02:58:46.561 --> 02:58:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

6399
02:58:47.280 --> 02:58:48.600
<v Speaker 1>he's doing crazy stuff.</v>

6400
02:58:48.601 --> 02:58:49.080
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to,</v>

6401
02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:52.220
<v Speaker 1>how do you train for a guy like Doris?</v>

6402
02:58:52.260 --> 02:58:55.030
<v Speaker 1>But because Sarah's is from uh,</v>

6403
02:58:55.031 --> 02:58:59.190
<v Speaker 1>the John Crouches camp and they do do some training up in the mountains.</v>

6404
02:58:59.340 --> 02:59:00.151
<v Speaker 1>That's an Arizona.</v>

6405
02:59:00.151 --> 02:59:00.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6406
02:59:00.541 --> 02:59:00.841
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

6407
02:59:00.841 --> 02:59:02.160
<v Speaker 1>They go into those Arizona mountains,</v>

6408
02:59:02.161 --> 02:59:03.500
<v Speaker 1>like Arizona does have mountains.</v>

6409
02:59:03.740 --> 02:59:04.740
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't realize how,</v>

6410
02:59:04.741 --> 02:59:05.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

6411
02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:05.431
<v Speaker 1>hey Brandon,</v>

6412
02:59:05.431 --> 02:59:06.920
<v Speaker 1>when he throws this right way,</v>

6413
02:59:06.990 --> 02:59:08.910
<v Speaker 1>ways head's going all the way to the side like that.</v>

6414
02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:10.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a really interesting thing.</v>

6415
02:59:10.501 --> 02:59:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

6416
02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:11.760
<v Speaker 1>is that normal or,</v>

6417
02:59:11.761 --> 02:59:12.594
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it.</v>

6418
02:59:12.790 --> 02:59:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

6419
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:14.810
<v Speaker 1>did you see him throw this right and he,</v>

6420
02:59:14.850 --> 02:59:15.631
<v Speaker 1>he ducks his head,</v>

6421
02:59:15.631 --> 02:59:15.880
<v Speaker 1>his head,</v>

6422
02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:16.600
<v Speaker 1>see what he's doing.</v>

6423
02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

6424
02:59:16.890 --> 02:59:17.380
<v Speaker 1>His head.</v>

6425
02:59:17.380 --> 02:59:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's.</v>

6426
02:59:17.820 --> 02:59:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I know a red Rodriguez.</v>

6427
02:59:19.530 --> 02:59:20.363
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

6428
02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:22.470
<v Speaker 1>He keeps punching the needs when he,</v>

6429
02:59:22.471 --> 02:59:23.250
<v Speaker 1>you'll see him go down,</v>

6430
02:59:23.250 --> 02:59:25.860
<v Speaker 1>he punches the knees just damn.</v>

6431
02:59:26.010 --> 02:59:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Although Alex or through a fucking knee had been trouble.</v>

6432
02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:29.753
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

6433
02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:31.380
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the side when he does it,</v>

6434
02:59:31.381 --> 02:59:32.640
<v Speaker 1>watch what that lesson was it,</v>

6435
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it's knowing when he see what he's doing.</v>

6436
02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It's knowing when you could do something too.</v>

6437
02:59:36.241 --> 02:59:37.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like knowing when your,</v>

6438
02:59:37.801 --> 02:59:41.550
<v Speaker 1>your opponent is leaning his weight backwards and reveal a time it right.</v>

6439
02:59:42.030 --> 02:59:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Or knowing when he's committing to one side or another side and being able to</v>

6440
02:59:46.141 --> 02:59:47.500
<v Speaker 1>anticipate it and time it.</v>

6441
02:59:47.520 --> 02:59:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's very one sided fight right now.</v>

6442
02:59:49.080 --> 02:59:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Very one sided fun fight though.</v>

6443
02:59:50.920 --> 02:59:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6444
02:59:51.220 --> 02:59:51.450
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6445
02:59:51.450 --> 02:59:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but inside you're so connected to help me out with this.</v>

6446
02:59:56.760 --> 02:59:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Just think about what I'm saying.</v>

6447
02:59:58.410 --> 03:00:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You're so connected to your previous statement that you are not willing to enjoy</v>

6448
03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>this fight as it plays out.</v>

6449
03:00:05.790 --> 03:00:06.001
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6450
03:00:06.001 --> 03:00:06.231
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

6451
03:00:06.231 --> 03:00:06.561
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>

6452
03:00:06.561 --> 03:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>You're wanting this fight.</v>

6453
03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:08.753
<v Speaker 1>Turn them up.</v>

6454
03:00:09.010 --> 03:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Just hit him with a beautiful knee to the body and a nice combination of right</v>

6455
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>would be there was a good shot.</v>

6456
03:00:13.961 --> 03:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Rodriguez isn't dominated.</v>

6457
03:00:16.060 --> 03:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

6458
03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:17.573
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

6459
03:00:19.580 --> 03:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6460
03:00:20.461 --> 03:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's just rang that bell sign might be changing a little bit here.</v>

6461
03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Please just listen to your,</v>

6462
03:00:25.530 --> 03:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>listen to your voice.</v>

6463
03:00:26.671 --> 03:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>The instinct of the back of my head is telling you right now.</v>

6464
03:00:28.501 --> 03:00:29.334
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

6465
03:00:29.430 --> 03:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6466
03:00:30.090 --> 03:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have that and I don't know because no,</v>

6467
03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>she's saying so far in,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Handling.</v>

6471
03:00:38.750 --> 03:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you sound like a guy in a movie.</v>

6472
03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey Brian handily,</v>

6473
03:00:43.740 --> 03:00:48.210

6474
03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:49.680

6475
03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh step Rah Rah.</v>

03:00:53.701 --> 03:00:54.211
<v Speaker 1>slippery,</v>

6478
03:00:54.211 --> 03:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>slippery third round.</v>

6479
03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Hud.</v>

6480
03:00:56.380 --> 03:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Regus is God.</v>

6481
03:00:57.541 --> 03:00:58.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

6482
03:00:58.171 --> 03:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>So is Alex to Harris who's on top bitch?</v>

6483
03:01:00.730 --> 03:01:01.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6484
03:01:01.060 --> 03:01:03.910
<v Speaker 2>they need a real Mexican guys.</v>

6485
03:01:03.911 --> 03:01:04.744
<v Speaker 2>A champ</v>

6486
03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:07.660
<v Speaker 2>that first round.</v>

6487
03:01:07.661 --> 03:01:11.410
<v Speaker 2>And why can Sarah was hard to deal with.</v>

6488
03:01:11.411 --> 03:01:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I will admit that I'm thinking about that first round.</v>

6489
03:01:15.580 --> 03:01:17.530
<v Speaker 2>He's just making fun of you right now.</v>

6490
03:01:17.531 --> 03:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

6491
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Whatever was on top,</v>

6492
03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take the bait up.</v>

6493
03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:22.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6494
03:01:22.671 --> 03:01:26.500
<v Speaker 2>you're Rodriguez and he's making fun of you ignoring your bait.</v>

6495
03:01:26.501 --> 03:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Cause I see the hook.</v>

6496
03:01:27.690 --> 03:01:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I not making pick nor at green cause he's winning this fight right now.</v>

6497
03:01:31.570 --> 03:01:31.901
<v Speaker 2>Alex,</v>

6498
03:01:31.901 --> 03:01:32.860
<v Speaker 2>you Sarah says winning.</v>

6499
03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:37.000
<v Speaker 2>This is a school yard fight and they pulled Alex to Sarah's off right now</v>

6500
03:01:37.030 --> 03:01:39.580
<v Speaker 2>everyone would agree that Alex because tariffs one that'd be truth.</v>

6501
03:01:39.610 --> 03:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Wants to be where he's created all the</v>

6502
03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:45.880
<v Speaker 2>travel was being sarcastic.</v>

6503
03:01:45.881 --> 03:01:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen just as what he does and you don't want you to know it.</v>

6504
03:01:50.231 --> 03:01:51.670
<v Speaker 2>You would assume he's on your side.</v>

6505
03:01:51.671 --> 03:01:52.810
<v Speaker 2>What's called honey ticking.</v>

6506
03:01:53.690 --> 03:01:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Hey could you do you know what you're doing?</v>

6507
03:01:56.230 --> 03:01:57.220
<v Speaker 2>Cause Sarah's won that round.</v>

6508
03:01:57.221 --> 03:01:58.054
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it to him.</v>

6509
03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:00.070
<v Speaker 2>He's probably two one but it's close.</v>

6510
03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Doing judge fights ever for fear of your own life,</v>

6511
03:02:04.170 --> 03:02:09.010
<v Speaker 2>for your safety to and fighters know the fans listening are going to back me up</v>

6512
03:02:09.011 --> 03:02:09.780
<v Speaker 2>on this.</v>

6513
03:02:09.780 --> 03:02:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I guess you're the uh,</v>

6514
03:02:10.900 --> 03:02:11.561
<v Speaker 2>well it's two one,</v>

6515
03:02:11.561 --> 03:02:12.311
<v Speaker 2>yeah I agree with you there.</v>

6516
03:02:12.311 --> 03:02:17.040
<v Speaker 2>But I guess a year in the circle of trust her so you can judge the fights bank's</v>

6517
03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:21.520
<v Speaker 2>money and I agree with you that first round he did win first and second buddy</v>

6518
03:02:21.970 --> 03:02:22.803
<v Speaker 2>first and second.</v>

6519
03:02:23.020 --> 03:02:25.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] a nice straight left hand.</v>

6520
03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:25.881
<v Speaker 2>Let me look.</v>

6521
03:02:25.881 --> 03:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Cause Sarah is a lucid to the head.</v>

6522
03:02:30.010 --> 03:02:30.843
<v Speaker 2>That was beautiful.</v>

6523
03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:32.710
<v Speaker 2>He's not touching.</v>

6524
03:02:32.711 --> 03:02:33.830
<v Speaker 2>He's not really hitting cause he was.</v>

6525
03:02:33.831 --> 03:02:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

6526
03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

6527
03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:35.613
<v Speaker 2>Hit him there man.</v>

6528
03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:36.191
<v Speaker 2>Boom them.</v>

6529
03:02:36.191 --> 03:02:37.024
<v Speaker 2>They're a little bit,</v>

6530
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:38.500
<v Speaker 2>a little bit cut up right there.</v>

6531
03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:39.333
<v Speaker 2>It's cut.</v>

6532
03:02:39.690 --> 03:02:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>

6533
03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

6534
03:02:41.230 --> 03:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>That was one highlight from a more than a minute of ground and power when he was</v>

6535
03:02:47.801 --> 03:02:48.634
<v Speaker 2>on top.</v>

6536
03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:49.480
<v Speaker 2>No big deals.</v>

6537
03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:50.320
<v Speaker 2>It's more than a minute.</v>

6538
03:02:51.810 --> 03:02:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Two minutes probably.</v>

6539
03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:53.853
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

6540
03:02:54.490 --> 03:02:56.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure how much time and weapons around two minutes,</v>

6541
03:02:56.920 --> 03:02:59.830
<v Speaker 2>but he beat him up on the ground for at least a minute.</v>

6542
03:02:59.870 --> 03:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Beat up.</v>

6543
03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Beat him up as a strong,</v>

6544
03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:02.813
<v Speaker 2>a strong statement.</v>

6545
03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:03.791
<v Speaker 2>It's a strong,</v>

6546
03:03:03.791 --> 03:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>you're strong.</v>

6547
03:03:04.981 --> 03:03:07.870
<v Speaker 2>You're being strong and you're being a little strong.</v>

6548
03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:09.260
<v Speaker 2>That beautiful round kick their butts.</v>

6549
03:03:09.310 --> 03:03:09.551
<v Speaker 2>It gets,</v>

6550
03:03:09.551 --> 03:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>has he whips it man.</v>

6551
03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:12.373
<v Speaker 2>Fucking weapon.</v>

6552
03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

6553
03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh he's so quick.</v>

6554
03:03:15.461 --> 03:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Look and see what he's doing when he's ducking his head like that.</v>

6555
03:03:17.471 --> 03:03:18.304
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

6556
03:03:18.310 --> 03:03:19.870
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen a lot of people throw writes that way.</v>

6557
03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously like super fit because he's recovered from that grappling.</v>

6558
03:03:23.740 --> 03:03:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Keeps the next round.</v>

6559
03:03:24.900 --> 03:03:25.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6560
03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Super feminist values.</v>

6561
03:03:28.270 --> 03:03:28.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6562
03:03:28.361 --> 03:03:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a cardio machine.</v>

6563
03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Have to be.</v>

6564
03:03:30.970 --> 03:03:31.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6565
03:03:31.331 --> 03:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>you have to be so ready to explode for five rounds.</v>

6566
03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>But he's connecting.</v>

6567
03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I would love to talk to him about like what kind of protocol he follows.</v>

6568
03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Like for strength and conditioning because he's like all this is so fast.</v>

6569
03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Like he's relying like a lot of his moves are like countermoves and like,</v>

6570
03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>oh his angles though.</v>

6571
03:03:49.181 --> 03:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>He keeps catching.</v>

6572
03:03:50.210 --> 03:03:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>

6573
03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:52.990

03:06:38.040 --> 03:06:39.190

03:06:39.191 --> 03:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>I follow the primal.</v>

6688
03:06:41.060 --> 03:06:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Do Rice very little,</v>

6689
03:06:42.941 --> 03:06:43.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6690
03:06:43.360 --> 03:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I just think that your body should at the most,</v>

6691
03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:46.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6692
03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:48.520
<v Speaker 1>get you like a certain amount of car.</v>

6693
03:06:48.521 --> 03:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Like some people think it's 25 grams of sugar.</v>

6694
03:06:50.471 --> 03:06:52.210
<v Speaker 1>They think that's probably the most important one.</v>

6695
03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Forget about carbohydrates.</v>

6696
03:06:53.740 --> 03:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Like the real important one in terms of like your own health is never allowing</v>

6697
03:06:57.391 --> 03:06:59.310
<v Speaker 1>yourself to get over 25 grams of sugar a day.</v>

6698
03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:00.121
<v Speaker 1>For most people,</v>

6699
03:07:00.121 --> 03:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not even a single glass of soda.</v>

6700
03:07:02.220 --> 03:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's hard for people to deal with it too.</v>

6701
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:06.343
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part.</v>

6702
03:07:06.810 --> 03:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of Mark Sisson's.</v>

6703
03:07:08.180 --> 03:07:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6708
03:07:13.830 --> 03:07:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not really supposed to.</v>

6709
03:07:15.150 --> 03:07:16.950
<v Speaker 1>You could fuck around with it a little bit every now and then,</v>

6710
03:07:16.951 --> 03:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't be a primary on every day you're dying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A couple of men,</v>

6956
03:13:45.980 --> 03:13:47.840
<v Speaker 1>a couple of men who see,</v>

6957
03:13:47.841 --> 03:13:49.250
<v Speaker 1>this is my question about yard,</v>

6958
03:13:49.310 --> 03:13:49.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6959
03:13:49.641 --> 03:13:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Yahya Rodriguez,</v>

6960
03:13:50.511 --> 03:13:51.344
<v Speaker 1>a style.</v>

6961
03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It's almost never been employed.</v>

6962
03:13:53.841 --> 03:13:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Like all these kind of kicks.</v>

6963
03:13:55.220 --> 03:13:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It's almost never been employed this way for five rounds.</v>

6964
03:14:01.130 --> 03:14:03.470
<v Speaker 1>What's the question he's,</v>

6965
03:14:03.471 --> 03:14:04.221
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>

6966
03:14:04.221 --> 03:14:06.320
<v Speaker 1>he's doing stuff that takes a lot of energy,</v>

6967
03:14:06.321 --> 03:14:06.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6968
03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:10.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is jumping and leaping and it's not a lot of damage though,</v>

6969
03:14:10.251 --> 03:14:10.940
<v Speaker 1>is he?</v>

6970
03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:11.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6971
03:14:11.271 --> 03:14:12.530
<v Speaker 1>he's not as damaged guy.</v>

6972
03:14:12.650 --> 03:14:13.880
<v Speaker 1>A really skillful guy.</v>

6973
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did damage to a Andre Fili and his last fight he knocked him out with</v>

6974
03:14:17.421 --> 03:14:19.230
<v Speaker 1>the jumping jumping round two.</v>

6975
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:21.230
<v Speaker 1>But before that is two decisions.</v>

6976
03:14:21.570 --> 03:14:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6977
03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:23.230
<v Speaker 1>But he's fighting tough guys man.</v>

6991
03:14:39.651 --> 03:14:41.390
<v Speaker 1>But he lost that fight but he's a great day.</v>

6992
03:14:41.410 --> 03:14:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he was definitely not scoring that fight.</v>

6993
03:14:43.820 --> 03:14:45.460
<v Speaker 1>And I know you were.</v>

7006
03:15:03.290 --> 03:15:03.980
<v Speaker 1>At least.</v>

7007
03:15:03.980 --> 03:15:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh for sure.</v>

7008
03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:05.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7009
03:15:05.390 --> 03:15:08.240
<v Speaker 1>You could probably get him to fight you for sure.</v>

7010
03:15:08.270 --> 03:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

7011
03:15:08.540 --> 03:15:09.140
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

7012
03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you for sure.</v>

7013
03:15:10.011 --> 03:15:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I definitely wasn't paying attention.</v>

7014
03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put money,</v>

7015
03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>put more money on it and me neither.</v>

7016
03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:19.580
<v Speaker 1>He listen to you guys I didn't miss around or a second.</v>

7017
03:15:19.940 --> 03:15:21.740
<v Speaker 1>It is super interesting.</v>

7018
03:15:21.741 --> 03:15:26.741
<v Speaker 1>The concept of adjusting and changing how fights are scored and the new criteria</v>

7019
03:15:27.951 --> 03:15:28.401
<v Speaker 1>for a 10,</v>

7020
03:15:28.401 --> 03:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>eight round.</v>

7021
03:15:29.090 --> 03:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>That could also be a giant new issue and especially three round fights.</v>

7022
03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:35.590
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a game changer.</v>

7023
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>The guy has to get a finished basically to win.</v>

7024
03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Well think of those two new moves.</v>

7025
03:15:39.171 --> 03:15:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Just the two new moves that we know.</v>

7026
03:15:41.230 --> 03:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

7027
03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:42.500
<v Speaker 1>the new uh,</v>

7028
03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:47.560
<v Speaker 1>hands down position being a like in order to be where you are off balance or a</v>

7029
03:15:49.201 --> 03:15:53.280
<v Speaker 1>off of a bounce for head kicks or knees to the ground,</v>

7030
03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to have both hands,</v>

7031
03:15:55.381 --> 03:15:57.300
<v Speaker 1>flat palms flat on the ground.</v>

7032
03:15:57.301 --> 03:15:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>

7033
03:15:57.960 --> 03:15:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Even the tips of your fingers.</v>

7034
03:15:58.931 --> 03:16:00.210
<v Speaker 1>The guy could punt you in the face,</v>

7035
03:16:00.400 --> 03:16:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you know he's saying remember if like Whoa,</v>

7036
03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:04.700
<v Speaker 1>we got one down.</v>

7037
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't touch them.</v>

7038
03:16:05.430 --> 03:16:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7039
03:16:05.850 --> 03:16:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Now getting remarried.</v>

7040
03:16:06.871 --> 03:16:07.530
<v Speaker 1>They do this,</v>

7041
03:16:07.530 --> 03:16:08.220
<v Speaker 1>they do this thing.</v>

7042
03:16:08.220 --> 03:16:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7043
03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to have both down.</v>

7044
03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got one blue one hand,</v>

7045
03:16:11.701 --> 03:16:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I can you in the face like I can kick you in the face.</v>

7046
03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:15.181
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

7047
03:16:15.181 --> 03:16:16.800
<v Speaker 1>that's so cute to changes.</v>

7048
03:16:16.801 --> 03:16:17.940
<v Speaker 1>And then the new change,</v>

7049
03:16:17.941 --> 03:16:20.100
<v Speaker 1>the criteria of how to score ten eight rounds,</v>

7050
03:16:20.340 --> 03:16:25.340
<v Speaker 1>they're establishing clearer understanding of what does and does not constitute</v>

7051
03:16:25.351 --> 03:16:26.184
<v Speaker 1>a ten eight round.</v>

7052
03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:27.713
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

7053
03:16:27.780 --> 03:16:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always going to be open to,</v>

7054
03:16:30.270 --> 03:16:31.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7055
03:16:31.380 --> 03:16:32.280
<v Speaker 1>to people's judgment.</v>

7056
03:16:32.310 --> 03:16:32.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7057
03:16:32.830 --> 03:16:36.000
<v Speaker 1>there's always an issue with the subject kill a motherfucker to get a ten eight</v>

7058
03:16:36.060 --> 03:16:36.721
<v Speaker 1>back in the day.</v>

7059
03:16:36.721 --> 03:16:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

7060
03:16:37.290 --> 03:16:37.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7061
03:16:37.771 --> 03:16:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I've had some ridiculous conversations with people about what does and does not</v>

7062
03:16:41.461 --> 03:16:42.570
<v Speaker 1>constitute a 10,</v>

7063
03:16:42.571 --> 03:16:45.840
<v Speaker 1>nine round or extending how that works in boxing I year one.</v>

7064
03:16:46.470 --> 03:16:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7065
03:16:46.900 --> 03:16:47.700
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

7066
03:16:47.700 --> 03:16:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Powerful Yahya Richard and powerful.</v>

7067
03:16:49.381 --> 03:16:50.214
<v Speaker 1>Eric's could Sarah's,</v>

7068
03:16:50.430 --> 03:16:50.921
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad mother.</v>

7069
03:16:50.921 --> 03:16:51.754
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker cray fight.</v>

7070
03:16:51.870 --> 03:16:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Great fight in boxing.</v>

7071
03:16:53.071 --> 03:16:54.630
<v Speaker 1>All you gotta do is knock a guy down.</v>

7072
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And unless you completely like,</v>

7073
03:16:55.921 --> 03:17:00.921
<v Speaker 1>say if a guy like Andre Ward is beaten your fucking ass all round the ring for</v>

7074
03:17:01.980 --> 03:17:02.813
<v Speaker 1>two minutes,</v>

7075
03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:03.930
<v Speaker 1>56 seconds.</v>

7076
03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:05.933
<v Speaker 1>Split decision.</v>

7077
03:17:06.060 --> 03:17:06.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7078
03:17:06.181 --> 03:17:07.140
<v Speaker 1>this is one 45.</v>

7079
03:17:07.141 --> 03:17:08.100
<v Speaker 1>One 40 45.</v>

7080
03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7081
03:17:08.850 --> 03:17:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So if a guy like Andre Ward's beating the fuck out of you for two minutes and 50</v>

7082
03:17:13.141 --> 03:17:16.800
<v Speaker 1>seconds and then you just close your eyes and swing and catch him on the Chin</v>

7083
03:17:16.801 --> 03:17:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and he falls down on his ass and he gets up at the count of eight and they dust</v>

7084
03:17:20.161 --> 03:17:22.530
<v Speaker 1>as gloves off in the round dance and by ten eight no,</v>

7085
03:17:23.200 --> 03:17:24.180
<v Speaker 1>probably be nine nine.</v>

7086
03:17:24.210 --> 03:17:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7087
03:17:24.990 --> 03:17:27.330
<v Speaker 1>But any other circumstance when you are,</v>

7088
03:17:27.331 --> 03:17:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a close fight or close round and the guy gets dropped.</v>

7089
03:17:30.241 --> 03:17:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It's always a ten eight okay.</v>

7090
03:17:32.100 --> 03:17:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much established.</v>

7091
03:17:33.221 --> 03:17:37.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a ten eight so we know if we're watching the fight at home and we know</v>

7092
03:17:37.111 --> 03:17:40.920
<v Speaker 1>like say if a Manny Pacquiao was fighting some dude and he knocks the dude down</v>

7093
03:17:40.921 --> 03:17:42.740
<v Speaker 1>three times in the first five rounds.</v>

7094
03:17:42.740 --> 03:17:43.740
<v Speaker 1>So like that guy's fucked.</v>

7095
03:17:43.741 --> 03:17:44.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't win a decision,</v>

7096
03:17:44.970 --> 03:17:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

7097
03:17:45.660 --> 03:17:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it can,</v>

7098
03:17:46.561 --> 03:17:48.210
<v Speaker 1>but he'd have to knock Manny down round.</v>

7099
03:17:48.211 --> 03:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you knock somebody out in one round that three times,</v>

7100
03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>if knock somebody down three times in one round,</v>

7101
03:17:52.831 --> 03:17:53.910
<v Speaker 1>what would the score be usually?</v>

7102
03:17:54.060 --> 03:17:54.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7103
03:17:54.361 --> 03:17:55.890
<v Speaker 1>it's one point for every knocked down.</v>

7104
03:17:55.891 --> 03:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's ten eight for one,</v>

7105
03:17:57.091 --> 03:18:01.990
<v Speaker 1>knocked down ten seven for two knock downs and in most title fights they waive</v>

7106
03:18:01.991 --> 03:18:05.910
<v Speaker 1>the three knockdown rule so he can have some fucking crazy chaotic shit like</v>

7107
03:18:05.911 --> 03:18:08.100
<v Speaker 1>some ass beating some organizations.</v>

7108
03:18:08.101 --> 03:18:09.590
<v Speaker 1>They waved that three knockdown rule.</v>

7109
03:18:11.050 --> 03:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>The state in the beginning it was a no three knockdown rule.</v>

7110
03:18:14.430 --> 03:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>K One took it to the next level.</v>

7111
03:18:16.291 --> 03:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>K One had a two knockdown rule.</v>

7112
03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:20.400
<v Speaker 1>If you got knocked out twice in a fight,</v>

7113
03:18:20.401 --> 03:18:23.010
<v Speaker 1>it was over cause they made you fight like three times a night.</v>

7114
03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:23.873
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

7115
03:18:23.890 --> 03:18:24.451
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

7116
03:18:24.451 --> 03:18:25.284
<v Speaker 1>That's sick.</v>

7117
03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:25.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7118
03:18:25.591 --> 03:18:26.424
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

7119
03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:28.020
<v Speaker 1>But here magic it fells one.</v>

7120
03:18:28.021 --> 03:18:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Slice the cheese.</v>

7121
03:18:28.740 --> 03:18:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

7122
03:18:29.010 --> 03:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm good getting knocked down.</v>

7123
03:18:31.350 --> 03:18:33.240
<v Speaker 1>You eating a pound of cheese but it's so good.</v>

7124
03:18:33.300 --> 03:18:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I knew you'd love this age provolone.</v>

7125
03:18:35.010 --> 03:18:36.720
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing quite like and my grandfather,</v>

7126
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent Sicilian.</v>

7127
03:18:38.210 --> 03:18:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a wheel is a shoe.</v>

7128
03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Is this?</v>

7129
03:18:40.470 --> 03:18:41.160
<v Speaker 1>You're for real.</v>

7130
03:18:41.160 --> 03:18:41.993
<v Speaker 1>I'm being dead serious.</v>

7131
03:18:42.770 --> 03:18:43.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7132
03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:43.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

7133
03:18:43.620 --> 03:18:44.310
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

7134
03:18:44.310 --> 03:18:45.960
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather would bring it home.</v>

7135
03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:48.370
<v Speaker 1>He'd bring a wheel of aged provolone.</v>

7136
03:18:48.380 --> 03:18:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Apologize to Alex Cause Sarah's now</v>

7137
03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you said he didn't have any fundamental,</v>

7138
03:18:54.191 --> 03:18:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

7139
03:18:54.650 --> 03:18:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I said his fundamentals are not as sound.</v>

7140
03:18:56.420 --> 03:18:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

7141
03:18:56.810 --> 03:18:57.643
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

7142
03:18:58.900 --> 03:18:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

7143
03:18:59.650 --> 03:19:01.720
<v Speaker 2>did he say his fundamentals aren't very good?</v>

7144
03:19:01.721 --> 03:19:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

7145
03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't remember what I said.</v>

7146
03:19:04.060 --> 03:19:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I knew it had something to do with never said anything about him at all.</v>

7147
03:19:08.231 --> 03:19:08.890
<v Speaker 2>But look at it.</v>

7148
03:19:08.890 --> 03:19:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Go back.</v>

7149
03:19:09.580 --> 03:19:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at the difference there Brian.</v>

7150
03:19:12.270 --> 03:19:13.390
<v Speaker 2>It was a split decision,</v>

7151
03:19:13.391 --> 03:19:15.970
<v Speaker 2>which means one judge thought that Kiss Harris did enough.</v>

7152
03:19:16.240 --> 03:19:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Judge,</v>

7153
03:19:16.530 --> 03:19:17.620
<v Speaker 2>you said an idiot.</v>

7154
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:18.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7155
03:19:18.101 --> 03:19:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure is it's,</v>

7156
03:19:19.610 --> 03:19:22.570
<v Speaker 2>it's no disrespect cause here's he's fighting an amazing fighter and he did a</v>

7157
03:19:22.571 --> 03:19:23.111
<v Speaker 2>great job,</v>

7158
03:19:23.111 --> 03:19:24.960
<v Speaker 2>but he did get tagged a lot and,</v>

7159
03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:28.180
<v Speaker 2>and we'll give that our boy didn't get hit much full and that crazy.</v>

7160
03:19:28.181 --> 03:19:29.420
<v Speaker 2>The whole kick does.</v>

7161
03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:30.401
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

7162
03:19:30.401 --> 03:19:31.121
<v Speaker 2>but he lost the fight.</v>

7163
03:19:31.121 --> 03:19:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying you can't tell from the naked eye that guide and have good</v>

7164
03:19:34.271 --> 03:19:34.751
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>

7165
03:19:34.751 --> 03:19:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

7166
03:19:35.350 --> 03:19:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say you didn't have good funnels.</v>

7167
03:19:36.810 --> 03:19:37.380
<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>

7168
03:19:37.380 --> 03:19:38.213
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

7169
03:19:38.410 --> 03:19:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I said you don't remember what he said is fundamental.</v>

7170
03:19:40.841 --> 03:19:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Are Not as good as say.</v>

7171
03:19:42.401 --> 03:19:43.234
<v Speaker 2>That's first.</v>

7172
03:19:45.130 --> 03:19:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Remember what I said.</v>

7173
03:19:45.930 --> 03:19:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I do think what I meant was let's,</v>

7174
03:19:48.311 --> 03:19:51.100
<v Speaker 2>let's just give you a chance to clarify right now because this has already been</v>

7175
03:19:51.101 --> 03:19:51.641
<v Speaker 2>principally,</v>

7176
03:19:51.641 --> 03:19:52.270
<v Speaker 2>so here's the,</v>

7177
03:19:52.270 --> 03:19:53.740
<v Speaker 2>here's what I and then a website,</v>

7178
03:19:53.960 --> 03:19:54.611
<v Speaker 2>but here's what I,</v>

7179
03:19:54.611 --> 03:19:55.300
<v Speaker 2>six wheels,</v>

7180
03:19:55.300 --> 03:19:56.133
<v Speaker 2>here's what I say.</v>

7181
03:19:56.380 --> 03:19:58.480
<v Speaker 2>All I was saying when I was watching that,</v>

7182
03:19:58.481 --> 03:19:59.314
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

7183
03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

7184
03:20:00.100 --> 03:20:02.770
<v Speaker 2>it looks like when Chris Harris throws the shot,</v>

7185
03:20:02.771 --> 03:20:05.560
<v Speaker 2>he takes it in the face and Mrs. Rodriguez,</v>

7186
03:20:05.561 --> 03:20:08.470
<v Speaker 2>this is round one and I went and I saw it three times and I'm like,</v>

7187
03:20:08.890 --> 03:20:09.910
<v Speaker 2>well and then,</v>

7188
03:20:09.940 --> 03:20:13.660
<v Speaker 2>well I'd see Rodrigues throw shot and when he throws shot,</v>

7189
03:20:13.661 --> 03:20:15.580
<v Speaker 2>he was in a position where he couldn't get hit.</v>

7190
03:20:15.581 --> 03:20:16.330
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

7191
03:20:16.330 --> 03:20:20.920
<v Speaker 2>that looks like Rodriguez has better fundamentals then [inaudible] you like</v>

7192
03:20:20.930 --> 03:20:22.560
<v Speaker 2>stand by that 100% who?</v>

7193
03:20:22.660 --> 03:20:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Well well-read version of the old man at the gas station.</v>

7194
03:20:26.140 --> 03:20:26.501
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

7195
03:20:26.501 --> 03:20:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Talks to his other old man.</v>

7196
03:20:29.140 --> 03:20:32.650
<v Speaker 2>We get together and you're like what he needed to do cause we did wrong.</v>

7197
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:34.400
<v Speaker 2>This is why you don't understand boxing.</v>

7198
03:20:34.660 --> 03:20:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Got Some Gay Sam guy that critiques Don Brady stolen motion.</v>

7199
03:20:37.620 --> 03:20:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I have to you.</v>

7200
03:20:38.140 --> 03:20:38.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7201
03:20:38.580 --> 03:20:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I do some boxing.</v>

7202
03:20:39.970 --> 03:20:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I obsess over fundamentals and I love it and I think I'm qualified to at least</v>

7203
03:20:44.380 --> 03:20:46.300
<v Speaker 2>know my naked eye.</v>

7204
03:20:46.340 --> 03:20:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh my naked actions to professional Missouri with my naked eye.</v>

7205
03:20:50.141 --> 03:20:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to quiet sir.</v>

7206
03:20:51.970 --> 03:20:53.000
<v Speaker 2>With my naked eye,</v>

7207
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>

7208
03:20:53.890 --> 03:20:54.550
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>

7209
03:20:54.550 --> 03:20:56.800
<v Speaker 2>if I may with my naked eye,</v>

7210
03:20:56.920 --> 03:21:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I am able to see who is actually a little better.</v>

7211
03:21:01.170 --> 03:21:02.003
<v Speaker 2>We'll to</v>

7212
03:21:03.340 --> 03:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>grade you.</v>

7213
03:21:04.090 --> 03:21:06.150
<v Speaker 2>What you said to a t,</v>

7214
03:21:06.151 --> 03:21:09.790
<v Speaker 2>you said Alex doesn't have any fundamental dude.</v>

7215
03:21:09.791 --> 03:21:13.160
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying at the end of the day is that if you look at funny,</v>

7216
03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:14.350
<v Speaker 2>if you have two fighters,</v>

7217
03:21:14.380 --> 03:21:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a sudden you're not qualified to judge the two fighters.</v>

7218
03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm able to fucking look at my fucking arms.</v>

7219
03:21:20.621 --> 03:21:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking start doing more curls.</v>

7220
03:21:22.750 --> 03:21:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

7221
03:21:23.230 --> 03:21:23.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

7222
03:21:23.470 --> 03:21:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Years of peace,</v>

7223
03:21:24.340 --> 03:21:25.180
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>

7224
03:21:25.181 --> 03:21:26.080
<v Speaker 2>But I just,</v>

7225
03:21:26.470 --> 03:21:26.881
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

7226
03:21:26.881 --> 03:21:27.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7227
03:21:27.330 --> 03:21:30.730
<v Speaker 2>just didn't think you were totally fair to what could Sarah's brings.</v>

7228
03:21:30.731 --> 03:21:31.810
<v Speaker 2>His life is not fair,</v>

7229
03:21:31.811 --> 03:21:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

7230
03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't think it was totally accurate.</v>

7231
03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not living in a nursery school.</v>

7232
03:21:35.880 --> 03:21:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I think you've got a little defensive afterwards and started defending it in</v>

7233
03:21:39.371 --> 03:21:40.320
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a weird way.</v>

7234
03:21:41.350 --> 03:21:41.711
<v Speaker 2>Guys.</v>

7235
03:21:41.711 --> 03:21:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I know had a good case,</v>

7236
03:21:42.851 --> 03:21:43.330
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>

7237
03:21:43.330 --> 03:21:44.081
<v Speaker 2>I really listen to,</v>

7238
03:21:44.081 --> 03:21:44.651
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>

7239
03:21:44.651 --> 03:21:46.010
<v Speaker 2>you can walk with this fairly</v>

7240
03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:47.630
<v Speaker 1>unscaved because yeah,</v>

7241
03:21:47.631 --> 03:21:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you're Rodriguez want a split decision,</v>

7242
03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:50.361
<v Speaker 1>so it's all good.</v>

7243
03:21:50.361 --> 03:21:53.220
<v Speaker 1>But they're both beasts based.</v>

7244
03:21:55.880 --> 03:21:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Rodriguez,</v>

7245
03:21:56.960 --> 03:21:58.010
<v Speaker 1>he's only three,</v>

7246
03:21:58.011 --> 03:22:00.630
<v Speaker 1>so 23 five and on the UFC,</v>

7247
03:22:00.631 --> 03:22:01.310
<v Speaker 1>he's so good.</v>

7248
03:22:01.310 --> 03:22:02.930
<v Speaker 1>He threw up on my holy shit.</v>

7249
03:22:03.700 --> 03:22:04.610
<v Speaker 1>He threw up on me once.</v>

7250
03:22:05.070 --> 03:22:05.903
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't his fault.</v>

7251
03:22:05.930 --> 03:22:06.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7252
03:22:06.171 --> 03:22:07.700
<v Speaker 1>it just took some of it got on my shoes.</v>

7253
03:22:07.970 --> 03:22:09.110
<v Speaker 1>He threw up on himself.</v>

7254
03:22:09.111 --> 03:22:11.270
<v Speaker 1>He like actually threw up underneath his,</v>

7255
03:22:11.271 --> 03:22:11.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7256

<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>

7257
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It was one of his fights at a brutal fight.</v>

7258
03:22:14.180 --> 03:22:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And a while I was talking to him while I was interviewing me.</v>

7259
03:22:16.281 --> 03:22:17.630
<v Speaker 1>He threw up Jesus Christ.</v>

7260
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.621
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

7261
03:22:18.621 --> 03:22:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you should be ashamed of himself to you.</v>

7262
03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:23.540
<v Speaker 1>He knows what judge gave off right now.</v>

7263
03:22:23.541 --> 03:22:24.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored.</v>

7264
03:22:24.081 --> 03:22:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored.</v>

7265
03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:25.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Gigas you know,</v>

7266
03:22:25.940 --> 03:22:28.550
<v Speaker 1>one judge gave her all three rounds an hour to look at that.</v>

7267
03:22:28.551 --> 03:22:29.900
<v Speaker 1>46 49 for Alex.</v>

7268
03:22:29.901 --> 03:22:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I might've changed his story.</v>

7269
03:22:30.891 --> 03:22:34.040
<v Speaker 1>He might've like throw like a particle might've landed on my foot and now all of</v>

7270
03:22:34.041 --> 03:22:35.390
<v Speaker 1>a sudden I'm like,</v>

7271
03:22:35.391 --> 03:22:36.224
<v Speaker 1>he threw up on me.</v>

7272
03:22:36.400 --> 03:22:37.041
<v Speaker 1>He doused.</v>

7273
03:22:37.041 --> 03:22:38.390
<v Speaker 1>You still counts,</v>

7274

7276
03:22:41.541 --> 03:22:42.320

7284
03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:53.410

7288
03:22:57.760 --> 03:23:00.830

<v Speaker 1>W W was a room,</v>

7396

<v Speaker 1>That's some bullshit.</v>

7402
03:25:20.580 --> 03:25:21.390
<v Speaker 1>They should do it.</v>

7403
03:25:21.390 --> 03:25:22.100
<v Speaker 1>They should,</v>

7404
03:25:22.100 --> 03:25:22.933
<v Speaker 1>if they were smart,</v>

7405
03:25:23.250 --> 03:25:24.810
<v Speaker 1>they should get George Wallace to do it.</v>

7406
03:25:24.990 --> 03:25:25.551
<v Speaker 1>And the shift,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's that hard to get chicken.</v>

7412
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Of course they can afford chicken.</v>

7434
03:26:07.890 --> 03:26:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

7435
03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:10.470
<v Speaker 1>After that first fight,</v>

7436
03:26:10.860 --> 03:26:11.970
<v Speaker 1>what this means.</v>

7437
03:26:12.180 --> 03:26:14.160
<v Speaker 1>This is a fucking crazy.</v>

7438
03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I imagine when they're about willing to watch this Michael Bisbing about to go</v>

7439
03:26:19.890 --> 03:26:20.640
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

7440
03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:20.911
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

7441
03:26:20.911 --> 03:26:25.911
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be fucking enhance these retiring be barriers,</v>

7442
03:26:26.980 --> 03:26:27.900
<v Speaker 1>legendary,</v>

7443
03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:28.793
<v Speaker 1>epic,</v>

7444
03:26:28.830 --> 03:26:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Iconic Shit,</v>

7445
03:26:29.701 --> 03:26:30.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7446
03:26:30.060 --> 03:26:30.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7447
03:26:30.181 --> 03:26:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm a growth guys.</v>

7448
03:26:32.820 --> 03:26:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I love this idea of a title fight.</v>

7449
03:26:34.981 --> 03:26:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the beautiful things about the UFC,</v>

7450
03:26:36.871 --> 03:26:38.520
<v Speaker 1>being able to make crazy fights like this.</v>

7451
03:26:38.940 --> 03:26:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson was like,</v>

7452
03:26:39.931 --> 03:26:40.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7453
03:26:40.141 --> 03:26:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably done.</v>

7454
03:26:41.041 --> 03:26:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know me.</v>

7455
03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I would fight for the title and</v>

7456
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:50.110
<v Speaker 1>he's the first fighter ever to hold two consecutive titles in two different</v>

7457
03:26:51.211 --> 03:26:52.440
<v Speaker 1>weight classes in pride.</v>

7458
03:26:52.650 --> 03:26:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Never got the UFC.</v>

7459
03:26:53.641 --> 03:26:54.930
<v Speaker 1>One man's never got the UFC one,</v>

7460
03:26:54.931 --> 03:26:55.291
<v Speaker 1>but if he,</v>

7461
03:26:55.291 --> 03:26:57.000
<v Speaker 1>if he gets it with this and then retires,</v>

7462
03:26:57.090 --> 03:26:58.110
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

7463
03:26:58.170 --> 03:26:58.621
<v Speaker 1>it goes down.</v>

7464
03:26:58.621 --> 03:26:59.311
<v Speaker 1>Pound for pound.</v>

7465
03:26:59.311 --> 03:27:00.170
<v Speaker 1>One of the best ever.</v>

7466
03:27:00.220 --> 03:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>He's already in the running right as like 10 forget about like numerically,</v>

7467
03:27:05.611 --> 03:27:06.780
<v Speaker 1>like who's more valuable?</v>

7468
03:27:06.781 --> 03:27:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Who accomplished more just straight up hall of fame legends.</v>

7469
03:27:11.610 --> 03:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Who's more legendary than Dan Henderson?</v>

7470
03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:14.673
<v Speaker 1>Randek door,</v>

7471
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:16.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe a day inhaler.</v>

7472
03:27:17.490 --> 03:27:18.323
<v Speaker 1>He's right up there.</v>

7473
03:27:18.450 --> 03:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Randy gets a bit more because Randy won the UFC,</v>

7474
03:27:22.410 --> 03:27:22.860
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

7475
03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Heavyweight title.</v>

7476
03:27:23.761 --> 03:27:25.770
<v Speaker 1>He won the UFC light heavyweight title,</v>

7477
03:27:25.890 --> 03:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>but at the time when Randy did,</v>

7478
03:27:27.181 --> 03:27:28.800
<v Speaker 1>when the light heavyweight title I,</v>

7479
03:27:28.801 --> 03:27:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

7480
03:27:29.300 --> 03:27:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's more impressive with Dan Henderson was doing in pride.</v>

7481
03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:33.960
<v Speaker 1>The guys who was beating,</v>

7482
03:27:34.180 --> 03:27:35.760
<v Speaker 1>it's the drug testing.</v>

7483
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7484
03:27:36.330 --> 03:27:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe his,</v>

7485
03:27:37.191 --> 03:27:37.891
<v Speaker 1>his weight,</v>

7486
03:27:37.891 --> 03:27:38.490
<v Speaker 1>his height.</v>

7487
03:27:38.490 --> 03:27:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

7488
03:27:38.910 --> 03:27:40.830
<v Speaker 1>One Randy coture knocked down Tim,</v>

7489
03:27:41.770 --> 03:27:44.170
<v Speaker 1>he's outweighed by like 50 pounds.</v>

7490
03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:46.450
<v Speaker 1>He drops Tim Sylvia with a fake,</v>

7491
03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:46.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7492
03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:50.770
<v Speaker 1>inside leg kick and a bomb of overhand right saint punched by the way that</v>

7493
03:27:50.771 --> 03:27:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Henderson used when he fought Bisbing boat.</v>

7494
03:27:52.970 --> 03:27:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he beat the brakes off Gonzaga Gonzaga Brennan choppy.</v>

7495
03:27:57.570 --> 03:28:02.080
<v Speaker 1>He beat can taco concise and he beat him with ed cocoa farm memory broke.</v>

7496
03:28:02.081 --> 03:28:02.531
<v Speaker 1>Randy's,</v>

7497
03:28:02.531 --> 03:28:05.350
<v Speaker 1>our rain was beating him with his fucking broken arm.</v>

7498
03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And then remember when Randy and I said,</v>

7499
03:28:08.441 --> 03:28:08.621
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

7500
03:28:08.621 --> 03:28:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Captain America.</v>

03:28:09.370 --> 03:28:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

7502
03:28:09.770 --> 03:28:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Can I douche tooth?</v>

7503
03:28:12.430 --> 03:28:13.820
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of the row.</v>

7504
03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:15.610
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] last fight.</v>

7505
03:28:15.611 --> 03:28:16.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to bring that up.</v>

7506
03:28:16.570 --> 03:28:16.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7507
03:28:16.751 --> 03:28:16.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7508
03:28:16.931 --> 03:28:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fighting to bring everybody to bring that out,</v>

7509
03:28:18.941 --> 03:28:19.540
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

7510
03:28:19.540 --> 03:28:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Why you gotta bring that up?</v>

7511
03:28:20.340 --> 03:28:21.280
<v Speaker 1>You know what's amazing?</v>

7512
03:28:21.930 --> 03:28:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I was not disrespectful.</v>

7513
03:28:23.210 --> 03:28:26.180
<v Speaker 1>You are these fighters first and second fight in the UFC right there.</v>

7514
03:28:26.230 --> 03:28:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I was doing the backstage.</v>

7515
03:28:28.470 --> 03:28:29.260
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>

7516
03:28:29.260 --> 03:28:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you are not there.</v>

7517
03:28:29.940 --> 03:28:30.121
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

7518
03:28:30.121 --> 03:28:34.170
<v Speaker 1>you and I went to the fight between Randy couture when he beat Vito Belfort.</v>

7519
03:28:34.540 --> 03:28:36.460
<v Speaker 1>We thought Vittorio was going to kill everybody.</v>

7520
03:28:36.910 --> 03:28:37.743
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

7521
03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I was powerful.</v>

7522
03:28:40.200 --> 03:28:41.033
<v Speaker 1>Veto power.</v>

7523
03:28:41.370 --> 03:28:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Papa Joe and I flew down to baton rouge or somewhere like that.</v>

7524
03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:47.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7525
03:28:47.141 --> 03:28:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Vito was so big,</v>

7526
03:28:48.821 --> 03:28:49.151
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7527
03:28:49.151 --> 03:28:51.130
<v Speaker 1>He was like two 40 back then,</v>

7528
03:28:51.370 --> 03:28:52.600
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not exaggerating,</v>

7529
03:28:53.020 --> 03:28:54.520
<v Speaker 1>he looked like a lion.</v>

7530
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

7531
03:28:54.910 --> 03:28:55.590
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy.</v>

7532
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:57.040
<v Speaker 1>But the Vito Belfort,</v>

7533
03:28:57.041 --> 03:28:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Randy couture's traps,</v>

7534
03:28:59.460 --> 03:29:00.790
<v Speaker 1>he punched like frank the tank.</v>

7535
03:29:01.480 --> 03:29:02.890
<v Speaker 1>He looked like bluedot from,</v>

7536
03:29:03.010 --> 03:29:03.670
<v Speaker 1>from Papa.</v>

7537
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7538
03:29:03.900 --> 03:29:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and I worked with Eddie and I used to work out with his trainer,</v>

7539
03:29:07.810 --> 03:29:08.890
<v Speaker 1>which worked out with this dude.</v>

7540
03:29:08.891 --> 03:29:10.330
<v Speaker 1>We used to call them garden hoses.</v>

7541
03:29:10.870 --> 03:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the Korean guy who is jazzed?</v>

7542
03:29:12.810 --> 03:29:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Purple is new.</v>

7543
03:29:14.290 --> 03:29:17.440
<v Speaker 1>He was a super nice guy and he a wound up.</v>

7544
03:29:17.470 --> 03:29:18.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

7545
03:29:18.580 --> 03:29:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

7546
03:29:18.970 --> 03:29:19.803
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what him,</v>

7547
03:29:19.940 --> 03:29:21.490
<v Speaker 1>30 minute real young.</v>

7548
03:29:22.540 --> 03:29:22.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7549
03:29:22.751 --> 03:29:23.584
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to see it.</v>

7550
03:29:23.710 --> 03:29:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

7551
03:29:24.430 --> 03:29:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Look at the sides of them.</v>

7552
03:29:25.570 --> 03:29:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

7553
03:29:26.441 --> 03:29:30.070
<v Speaker 1>So they had some seller to get deep into the fight itself.</v>

7554
03:29:30.190 --> 03:29:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Take Yo girl.</v>

7555
03:29:31.690 --> 03:29:32.000

03:29:33.300 --> 03:29:33.970
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

7558
03:29:33.970 --> 03:29:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I think this is like,</v>

7559
03:29:35.350 --> 03:29:36.700
<v Speaker 1>is this the actual fight itself there?</v>

7560
03:29:36.701 --> 03:29:37.534
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

7561
03:29:37.800 --> 03:29:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7562
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:39.040
<v Speaker 1>It started from the beginning though.</v>

7563
03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:39.883
<v Speaker 1>Start from the beginning.</v>

7564
03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:41.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of the round.</v>

7565
03:29:41.620 --> 03:29:42.270
<v Speaker 1>He was yelling.</v>

7566
03:29:42.270 --> 03:29:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just highlights fellas.</v>

7567
03:29:46.410 --> 03:29:47.243
<v Speaker 1>So angry.</v>

7568
03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:49.450
<v Speaker 1>They look very well.</v>

7569
03:29:49.451 --> 03:29:50.560
<v Speaker 1>He looks about the same age.</v>

7570
03:29:50.910 --> 03:29:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Big is big.</v>

7571
03:29:52.690 --> 03:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Vittores back is this was,</v>

7572
03:29:54.820 --> 03:29:55.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7573
03:29:55.151 --> 03:29:58.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you think it'd be tour Wade then to 42 days.</v>

7574
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Handsome.</v>

7575
03:29:58.720 --> 03:29:58.931
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

7576
03:29:58.931 --> 03:30:02.740
<v Speaker 1>but this is like a prime example of having maybe too much muscle.</v>

7577
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you almost get too strong and too powerful and maybe it's not like the</v>

7578
03:30:08.141 --> 03:30:09.700
<v Speaker 1>right thing for your friend,</v>

7579
03:30:09.720 --> 03:30:10.553
<v Speaker 1>not back then.</v>

7580
03:30:10.800 --> 03:30:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of Woodley would beg to differ.</v>

7581
03:30:12.971 --> 03:30:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

7582
03:30:13.340 --> 03:30:14.840
<v Speaker 1>He's built different Woodley's,</v>

7583
03:30:14.860 --> 03:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>thicker boned.</v>

7584
03:30:15.970 --> 03:30:16.810
<v Speaker 1>He's got bigger fleet.</v>

7585
03:30:16.811 --> 03:30:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Please also recall that he ever look how small vittores feet are.</v>

7586
03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>He's not a big giant guy,</v>

7587
03:30:22.660 --> 03:30:23.291
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

7588
03:30:23.291 --> 03:30:26.400
<v Speaker 1>he's a super athletic guy and you know,</v>

7589
03:30:26.410 --> 03:30:30.130
<v Speaker 1>he's had a lot of issues with his hands breaking cause he punches so hard and so</v>

7590
03:30:30.131 --> 03:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

7591
03:30:30.640 --> 03:30:31.640
<v Speaker 1>He's also been doing it for the,</v>

7592
03:30:31.690 --> 03:30:33.250
<v Speaker 1>and he's fucked.</v>

7593
03:30:33.390 --> 03:30:33.700
<v Speaker 1>We'll beat,</v>

7594
03:30:33.700 --> 03:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7595
03:30:33.940 --> 03:30:38.940
<v Speaker 1>v towards had I believe at least eight operations on his hands.</v>

7596
03:30:39.080 --> 03:30:42.530
<v Speaker 1>And he also had a PRT path for white shoes.</v>

7597
03:30:43.250 --> 03:30:43.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7598
03:30:43.461 --> 03:30:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Randy couture was wearing shoes.</v>

7599
03:30:44.661 --> 03:30:45.111
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

7600
03:30:45.111 --> 03:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

7601
03:30:45.800 --> 03:30:46.221
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

7602
03:30:46.221 --> 03:30:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and crazies.</v>

7603
03:30:47.250 --> 03:30:49.170
<v Speaker 1>One was um,</v>

7604
03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:50.070
<v Speaker 1>used to be an option.</v>

7605
03:30:50.180 --> 03:30:51.980
<v Speaker 1>You could wear shoes up until,</v>

7606
03:30:52.520 --> 03:30:53.360
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>

7607
03:30:53.361 --> 03:30:54.500
<v Speaker 1>When I was doing,</v>

7608
03:30:54.501 --> 03:30:54.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7609
03:30:54.830 --> 03:30:56.180
<v Speaker 1>the post fight interviews,</v>

7610
03:30:56.181 --> 03:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it was always you could wear shoes and early on it was no gloves.</v>

7611
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I think the gloves came along later.</v>

7612
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:03.531
<v Speaker 1>Early on,</v>

7613
03:31:03.531 --> 03:31:04.970
<v Speaker 1>no one was wearing gloves.</v>

7614
03:31:05.900 --> 03:31:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Like the first fights I worked at,</v>

7615
03:31:07.600 --> 03:31:09.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe like a couple of guys were wearing gloves,</v>

7616
03:31:09.561 --> 03:31:12.200
<v Speaker 1>like Vito was wearing gloves tank Abbott used to wear gloves,</v>

7617
03:31:12.800 --> 03:31:13.481
<v Speaker 1>but most guys wear,</v>

7618
03:31:13.481 --> 03:31:14.314
<v Speaker 1>I wear gloves,</v>

7619
03:31:15.220 --> 03:31:16.053
<v Speaker 1>I have gloves on.</v>

7620
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:18.590
<v Speaker 1>But with ventral fun and he said in this fire and he said,</v>

7621
03:31:18.591 --> 03:31:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to beat him.</v>

7622
03:31:19.340 --> 03:31:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I beat him with boxing.</v>

7623
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7624
03:31:21.261 --> 03:31:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Well he just kept pressure on it till you can't,</v>

7625
03:31:23.480 --> 03:31:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Randy's a guy that you,</v>

7626
03:31:24.711 --> 03:31:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you can't take for granted and this kind of defense bodies now there and look at</v>

7627
03:31:28.641 --> 03:31:29.810
<v Speaker 1>his body when he's 48.</v>

7628
03:31:29.811 --> 03:31:30.644
<v Speaker 1>And my keys,</v>

7629
03:31:30.980 --> 03:31:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do that,</v>

7630
03:31:31.760 --> 03:31:33.440
<v Speaker 1>granted obviously he's on fucking,</v>

7631
03:31:33.441 --> 03:31:34.320
<v Speaker 1>he's juice to the gills.</v>

7632
03:31:34.321 --> 03:31:37.640
<v Speaker 1>But if you do that with any 48 year old to 19 year old,</v>

7633
03:31:37.641 --> 03:31:38.570
<v Speaker 1>they're going to look different.</v>

7634
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:40.690
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty technical fight for it.</v>

7635
03:31:40.691 --> 03:31:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was Randy.</v>

7636
03:31:42.140 --> 03:31:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Randy was not 48 30 years.</v>

7637
03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:49.630
<v Speaker 1>37 I'm saying V tore his body when he's 19.</v>

7638
03:31:49.800 --> 03:31:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Anyone from 19 to fucking 39 or 42 cha Randy here.</v>

7639
03:31:55.520 --> 03:31:56.181
<v Speaker 1>Randy.</v>

7640
03:31:56.181 --> 03:31:56.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7641
03:31:56.481 --> 03:32:01.481
<v Speaker 1>I believe he had his first fight in the UFC when he was 36 to 34 36 34 I'm</v>

7642
03:32:01.521 --> 03:32:03.290
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure it's 36 well,</v>

7643
03:32:03.291 --> 03:32:04.370
<v Speaker 1>so he was in his thirties.</v>

7644
03:32:04.660 --> 03:32:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Well this was in what,</v>

7645
03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:09.770
<v Speaker 1>1999 or may not.</v>

7646
03:32:09.860 --> 03:32:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Probably not that late.</v>

7647
03:32:11.570 --> 03:32:15.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 97 98 so maybe,</v>

7648
03:32:15.021 --> 03:32:15.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7649
03:32:15.261 --> 03:32:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I came along,</v>

7650
03:32:16.640 --> 03:32:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I started doing it at 97 and I did it.</v>

7651
03:32:19.110 --> 03:32:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I only did it for like a year and a half until they wanted me to go to Japan.</v>

7652
03:32:22.461 --> 03:32:22.761
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7653
03:32:22.761 --> 03:32:23.594
<v Speaker 1>check please.</v>

7654
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Was this the first,</v>

7655
03:32:24.510 --> 03:32:27.290
<v Speaker 1>this was your first time playing where you call it done?</v>

7656
03:32:27.350 --> 03:32:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't call the fights back then.</v>

7657
03:32:28.971 --> 03:32:29.721
<v Speaker 1>I just did the,</v>

7658
03:32:29.721 --> 03:32:29.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7659
03:32:29.901 --> 03:32:32.040
<v Speaker 1>the interviews afterwards and I did,</v>

7660
03:32:32.210 --> 03:32:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I did definitely did the interview after this one.</v>

7661
03:32:34.220 --> 03:32:34.440
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

7662
03:32:34.440 --> 03:32:35.221
<v Speaker 1>you and I went to Ken.</v>

7663
03:32:35.221 --> 03:32:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I remember the hospital's Great.</v>

7664
03:32:36.560 --> 03:32:36.861
<v Speaker 1>Randy.</v>

7665
03:32:36.861 --> 03:32:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Once he got that takedown,</v>

7666
03:32:38.180 --> 03:32:39.770
<v Speaker 1>this fight doesn't look dated.</v>

7667
03:32:39.771 --> 03:32:41.590
<v Speaker 1>This looks like a fight that could damage</v>

7668
03:32:43.760 --> 03:32:44.150
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

7669
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

7670
03:32:44.540 --> 03:32:44.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7671
03:32:44.871 --> 03:32:45.441
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

7672
03:32:45.441 --> 03:32:46.610
<v Speaker 1>And this is so old.</v>

7673
03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look dated at all.</v>

7674
03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:49.581
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

7675
03:32:49.581 --> 03:32:50.230
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

7676
03:32:50.230 --> 03:32:51.063
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

7677
03:32:51.290 --> 03:32:52.500
<v Speaker 1>You're Randy was a beast man.</v>

7678
03:32:52.670 --> 03:32:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably doesn't get nearly enough respect or credit with today's</v>

7679
03:32:56.390 --> 03:32:57.170
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

7680
03:32:57.170 --> 03:32:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7681
03:32:57.910 --> 03:32:58.970
<v Speaker 1>not today's fighters,</v>

7682
03:32:58.971 --> 03:33:00.530
<v Speaker 1>rather a today's fans.</v>

7683
03:33:00.680 --> 03:33:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the people that are newly to the game,</v>

7684
03:33:04.310 --> 03:33:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a big percentage of them go back and watch the early fights.</v>

7685
03:33:08.810 --> 03:33:10.070
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things about fight pass.</v>

7686
03:33:10.071 --> 03:33:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I hate to be a show for the company,</v>

7687
03:33:12.080 --> 03:33:15.230
<v Speaker 1>but a free like pass is fucking awesome.</v>

7688
03:33:15.260 --> 03:33:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Not as a bypass.</v>

7689
03:33:16.700 --> 03:33:18.200
<v Speaker 1>He swam from the UFC son.</v>

7690
03:33:18.201 --> 03:33:18.531
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

7691
03:33:18.531 --> 03:33:19.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't have on fight pass.</v>

7692
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

7693
03:33:20.090 --> 03:33:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive it all.</v>

7694
03:33:21.231 --> 03:33:22.550
<v Speaker 1>His Shit's banned from the EOC.</v>

7695
03:33:22.610 --> 03:33:22.821
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7696
03:33:22.821 --> 03:33:23.720
<v Speaker 1>He's not in the hall of fame.</v>

7697
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Can't come to the events.</v>

7698
03:33:24.860 --> 03:33:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's fucking on fight pass.</v>

7699
03:33:26.300 --> 03:33:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

7700
03:33:26.810 --> 03:33:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm barely on fight pass and I said,</v>

7701
03:33:28.281 --> 03:33:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Reebok.</v>

7702
03:33:29.090 --> 03:33:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I alone Randy couture.</v>

7703
03:33:30.890 --> 03:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought fight pass was all the UFC fights.</v>

7704
03:33:33.890 --> 03:33:34.723
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

7705
03:33:34.940 --> 03:33:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I would be surprised a he's on there.</v>

7706
03:33:37.050 --> 03:33:37.883
<v Speaker 1>Find out Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

7708
03:33:38.251 --> 03:33:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can totally say that without knowing for sure.</v>

7709
03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:41.913
<v Speaker 1>Let me this</v>

7710

03:33:47.010 --> 03:33:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I just Google it on my phone.</v>

7713
03:33:48.121 --> 03:33:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He comes up on it on fire.</v>

7714
03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You can watch his fights.</v>

7715
03:33:50.530 --> 03:33:51.450
<v Speaker 1>He's tired here.</v>

7716
03:33:52.050 --> 03:33:53.300
<v Speaker 1>This is technical shit.</v>

7717
03:33:53.900 --> 03:33:54.733
<v Speaker 1>All of this.</v>

7718
03:33:54.870 --> 03:33:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I know Randy couture control.</v>

7849
03:37:33.280 --> 03:37:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the fucking resource of the fight library,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now look at that.</v>

7853
03:37:43.960 --> 03:37:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So think about all these things that are taking place in this fight with Vito</v>

03:37:46.901 --> 03:37:47.680
<v Speaker 1>and Randy.</v>

7896
03:38:42.371 --> 03:38:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Just to let you know that you could think that all martial artists are going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>Kind of similar take out,</v>

7904
03:38:54.321 --> 03:38:55.510
<v Speaker 1>but tank even crazier.</v>

7905
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Crazier than Roy Nelson from the looks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he can fucking nuts or face off.</v>

7912
03:39:04.510 --> 03:39:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I ran into Mark Coleman after he lost to Maurice Smith and he basically gassed</v>

7913
03:39:08.851 --> 03:39:09.251
<v Speaker 1>in that one.</v>

7914
03:39:09.251 --> 03:39:10.084
<v Speaker 1>I remember that fight.</v>

7915
03:39:10.150 --> 03:39:11.020
<v Speaker 1>It was like fucking,</v>

7916

<v Speaker 1>He was barely hanging on and he was like panicking and uh,</v>

7919
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:20.703
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7920

<v Speaker 1>called NHP.</v>

7922
03:39:27.820 --> 03:39:30.700

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7944
03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I was really interested to see how tank was going to be able to deal with those</v>

7945
03:40:11.151 --> 03:40:16.151
<v Speaker 1>leg kicks as Maurice was so fucking skillful as far as like a real heavyweight</v>

7946
03:40:17.661 --> 03:40:21.170
<v Speaker 1>cause Maurice is a real natural heavyweight is a big dude but a real</v>

7947
03:40:21.171 --> 03:40:21.680
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>

7948
03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:26.680
<v Speaker 1>That's that fucking good at Moy Tai who comes over into it to MMA and again just</v>

7949
03:40:27.981 --> 03:40:28.814
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

7950
03:40:29.170 --> 03:40:33.170
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of guys he came over after a long career in kickboxing.</v>

7951
03:40:33.230 --> 03:40:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Super Long career.</v>

03:40:34.100 --> 03:40:34.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

03:40:34.281 --> 03:40:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a legend in Denver.</v>

7954
03:40:35.810 --> 03:40:35.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7955
03:40:35.991 --> 03:40:37.550
<v Speaker 1>He'd fought for a long time.</v>

7956
03:40:37.551 --> 03:40:38.060
<v Speaker 1>One a one,</v>

7957
03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:39.110
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of titles.</v>

7958
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:41.330
<v Speaker 1>You said the weirdest thing after this fight too.</v>

7959
03:40:41.331 --> 03:40:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember I said,</v>

7960
03:40:42.020 --> 03:40:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you said after the fight you are next to him and he said,</v>

7961
03:40:45.321 --> 03:40:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I looked in his mouth and it looked like his mouth had different parts in it.</v>

7962
03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Like he had just all these,</v>

7963
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:51.830
<v Speaker 1>like these thick jaw muscles.</v>

7964
03:40:51.831 --> 03:40:53.360
<v Speaker 1>You just looked into his mouth tank.</v>

7965
03:40:53.420 --> 03:40:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7966
03:40:54.030 --> 03:40:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7967
03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:55.840
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely built different than the regular human.</v>

7968
03:40:55.860 --> 03:40:56.820
<v Speaker 1>What's he do these things.</v>

7969
03:40:56.840 --> 03:40:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what he's meant.</v>

7970
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:59.560
<v Speaker 1>That was getting money.</v>

7971
03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:01.510
<v Speaker 1>The angels,</v>

7972
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:04.340
<v Speaker 1>his wait for anybody to open their fucking pie hole.</v>

7973
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.821
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

7974
03:41:04.821 --> 03:41:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't want that.</v>

7975
03:41:06.010 --> 03:41:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Then a bar with a bad day and he said scared though.</v>

7976
03:41:08.401 --> 03:41:09.234
<v Speaker 1>Want it?</v>

7977
03:41:09.290 --> 03:41:11.270
<v Speaker 1>He meant something like 600 pounds,</v>

7978
03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:12.673
<v Speaker 1>600 pounds.</v>

7979
03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:14.030
<v Speaker 1>He's a gorilla man.</v>

7980
03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Right up.</v>

03:42:01.700 --> 03:42:02.533
<v Speaker 1>what's he like?</v>

8021
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:03.381
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing?</v>

8022
03:42:03.381 --> 03:42:03.951
<v Speaker 1>He's got a school,</v>

8023
03:42:03.951 --> 03:42:04.520
<v Speaker 1>right man,</v>

8024
03:42:04.520 --> 03:42:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know he's doing,</v>

8025
03:42:06.020 --> 03:42:06.950
<v Speaker 1>he's a good dude though.</v>

8026
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Enormous heart.</v>

8027
03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>He definitely has normally funny.</v>

8028
03:42:11.121 --> 03:42:12.320
<v Speaker 1>He had a great sense of humor,</v>

8029
03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but he's also very smart.</v>

8030
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:15.470
<v Speaker 1>When it came to fighting,</v>

8031
03:42:15.471 --> 03:42:19.430
<v Speaker 1>he was very smart and one of the things that he had above everybody is cardio.</v>

8032
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Maury Smith used to do co Raisie cardio drills.</v>

8033
03:42:22.881 --> 03:42:25.940
<v Speaker 1>He would do like these back and forth sprints in the pool.</v>

8034
03:42:26.060 --> 03:42:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

8035
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:30.110
<v Speaker 1>like really hardcore long range cardio stuff.</v>

8036
03:42:30.350 --> 03:42:32.610
<v Speaker 1>So when he got into these long fights,</v>

8037
03:42:32.820 --> 03:42:33.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8038
03:42:33.001 --> 03:42:33.930
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to remember,</v>

8039
03:42:33.931 --> 03:42:35.520
<v Speaker 1>we're not even talking about a five minute round.</v>

8040
03:42:35.521 --> 03:42:35.791
<v Speaker 1>I don't even,</v>

8041
03:42:35.791 --> 03:42:37.530
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck the rounds were back then?</v>

8042
03:42:37.680 --> 03:42:38.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

8043
03:42:38.730 --> 03:42:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Can you find out what the,</v>

8044
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:40.680
<v Speaker 1>the rounds were?</v>

8045
03:42:40.740 --> 03:42:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Two 77 this is back like UFC twelveish 13 ish,</v>

8046
03:42:45.001 --> 03:42:45.960
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there.</v>

8047
03:42:46.300 --> 03:42:47.640
<v Speaker 1>UFC 12 is when I started.</v>

8048
03:42:47.641 --> 03:42:50.060
<v Speaker 1>This is maybe like 14 UFC 40 charters.</v>

8049
03:42:50.970 --> 03:42:51.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

8050
03:42:51.601 --> 03:42:52.920

03:42:55.021 --> 03:42:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Can't believe he goes all the way back.</v>

8054
03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.170
<v Speaker 1>He's an inexorable,</v>

8055
03:42:58.560 --> 03:43:00.090
<v Speaker 1>he's such a part of the thing.</v>

8056
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:02.520
<v Speaker 1>You know God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>UFC 12 as the first one with weight classes and UFC 15 set limitations and hair</v>

8063
03:43:19.881 --> 03:43:21.020
<v Speaker 1>pulling and banding of strikes.</v>

8064
03:43:21.021 --> 03:43:24.380
<v Speaker 1>The back of the neck and head headbutting small joint manipulations in groin</v>

8065
03:43:24.381 --> 03:43:26.930
<v Speaker 1>strikes with five minute rounds introduced to UFC 21.</v>

8066
03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8067
03:43:27.531 --> 03:43:28.370
<v Speaker 1>UFC 21.</v>

8069
03:43:29.480 --> 03:43:30.920
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of the 12 to six rule?</v>

8070
03:43:31.010 --> 03:43:31.910

<v Speaker 1>Took them down.</v>

8087
03:43:58.500 --> 03:43:59.333
<v Speaker 1>I forgot that.</v>

8088
03:43:59.500 --> 03:43:59.890

03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:00.980
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

8091
03:44:00.980 --> 03:44:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I had an old school wrestling devil late.</v>

8092
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Maury Smith had a very underrated,</v>

8093
03:44:06.811 --> 03:44:08.550
<v Speaker 1>very good defensive guard.</v>

8094
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:09.950
<v Speaker 1>He went butterfly a lot.</v>

8095
03:44:09.951 --> 03:44:10.650
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

8096
03:44:10.650 --> 03:44:12.750
<v Speaker 1>back then it was very hard to pass his guard.</v>

8097
03:44:13.020 --> 03:44:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8098
03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:14.970
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't just pass this guard.</v>

8099
03:44:15.890 --> 03:44:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8100
03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Maurice is smart dude.</v>

8101
03:44:17.820 --> 03:44:18.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart,</v>

8102
03:44:18.721 --> 03:44:19.770
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to fighting too,</v>

8103
03:44:19.771 --> 03:44:20.220
<v Speaker 1>he has a,</v>

8104
03:44:20.220 --> 03:44:24.510
<v Speaker 1>he had a remarkable ability to remain calm in combat.</v>

8105
03:44:24.810 --> 03:44:25.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8106
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why he was so dangerous.</v>

8107
03:44:27.481 --> 03:44:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Like you could take him out like we saw with the,</v>

8108
03:44:29.851 --> 03:44:30.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8109
03:44:30.330 --> 03:44:30.721

8110
03:44:30.721 --> 03:44:31.554
<v Speaker 1>who's head kick,</v>

8111
03:44:31.650 --> 03:44:32.281
<v Speaker 1>but that's a kicked,</v>

8112
03:44:32.281 --> 03:44:35.470
<v Speaker 1>it takes out everybody that ever lived back then.</v>

8113
03:44:35.471 --> 03:44:36.500
<v Speaker 1>That was one of those kicks.</v>

8114
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:37.100
<v Speaker 1>That's book.</v>

8115
03:44:37.100 --> 03:44:39.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a brutal kick that he did on Maurice too.</v>

8116
03:44:39.420 --> 03:44:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets Koi by that kick.</v>

8117
03:44:41.490 --> 03:44:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But what Maurice was,</v>

8118
03:44:43.410 --> 03:44:47.070
<v Speaker 1>was capable of was a,</v>

8119
03:44:47.100 --> 03:44:49.260
<v Speaker 1>at a super high world class level.</v>

8120
03:44:49.261 --> 03:44:49.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8121
03:44:49.531 --> 03:44:50.364
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

8122
03:44:50.760 --> 03:44:53.940
<v Speaker 1>he's an all time great when it comes to from America for sure.</v>

8123
03:44:53.970 --> 03:44:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Just pass Moises guard.</v>

8124

<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

8125
03:44:57.240 --> 03:45:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I was talking so much shit about Morris Garden Passes Guard.</v>

8126
03:45:00.540 --> 03:45:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Maurice put them right back in it and you know what that is?</v>

8127
03:45:03.410 --> 03:45:05.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the transition that I did not remember.</v>

8128
03:45:06.310 --> 03:45:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8129
03:45:07.050 --> 03:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>technical tank actually technically passed Maury Smith's guard.</v>

8130
03:45:11.020 --> 03:45:11.281

03:45:13.250 --> 03:45:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you see this photo up?</v>

8134
03:45:14.161 --> 03:45:17.640
<v Speaker 1>There was that tank trying to throw a guy out of the rain that ever happened?</v>

8135
03:45:17.790 --> 03:45:18.770
<v Speaker 1>He came close.</v>

8136
03:45:19.150 --> 03:45:19.600
<v Speaker 1>You got to go.</v>

8137
03:45:19.600 --> 03:45:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Go out.</v>

8138
03:45:20.250 --> 03:45:21.960
<v Speaker 1>The guy stayed sort of in it,</v>

8139
03:45:22.320 --> 03:45:23.160
<v Speaker 1>but it was an issue.</v>

8140
03:45:23.161 --> 03:45:23.851
<v Speaker 1>He almost fell out.</v>

8141
03:45:23.851 --> 03:45:26.610
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a rule then the good question.</v>

8142
03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You have to open the door.</v>

8143
03:45:27.360 --> 03:45:28.193
<v Speaker 1>Let the guy back in</v>

8144
03:45:30.250 --> 03:45:32.310
<v Speaker 1>each feel like a real big cheese sauce out of the ring.</v>

8145
03:45:32.320 --> 03:45:33.153
<v Speaker 1>You on a walk back,</v>

8146
03:45:33.170 --> 03:45:33.610
<v Speaker 1>get in.</v>

8147
03:45:33.610 --> 03:45:33.761
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8148
03:45:33.761 --> 03:45:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that guy just wasted a lot of energy and time to go after</v>

8149
03:45:38.190 --> 03:45:41.230
<v Speaker 1>good at surviving on the ground as a kickboxer.</v>

8150
03:45:41.790 --> 03:45:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know that many kickboxers with the guard is good.</v>

8151
03:45:45.221 --> 03:45:45.760
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

8152
03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:45.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

8153
03:45:45.941 --> 03:45:47.710
<v Speaker 1>you know why Frank Shamrock,</v>

8154
03:45:48.090 --> 03:45:49.060
<v Speaker 1>he and frank shamrock,</v>

8155
03:45:49.061 --> 03:45:52.240
<v Speaker 1>we're very close and this is when frank shamrock was at his best.</v>

8156
03:45:53.580 --> 03:45:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when frank shamrock was a UFC champion,</v>

8157
03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:00.430
<v Speaker 1>when a frank beat John Lobur that rematch like he was,</v>

8158
03:46:00.431 --> 03:46:03.730
<v Speaker 1>he was palling around with Maurice back then think they both helped each other a</v>

8159
03:46:03.731 --> 03:46:03.971
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

8160
03:46:03.971 --> 03:46:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I think more he's helped frank with a lot of cardio,</v>

8161
03:46:07.060 --> 03:46:12.060
<v Speaker 1>like really emphasizing how strong a role cardio plays and also with Maurice of</v>

8162
03:46:12.671 --> 03:46:17.500
<v Speaker 1>course showing him like real proper kickboxing fundamentals it sees in his</v>

8163
03:46:17.501 --> 03:46:18.250
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

8164
03:46:18.250 --> 03:46:19.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8165
03:46:19.240 --> 03:46:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Frank.</v>

8166
03:46:19.840 --> 03:46:20.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8167
03:46:20.800 --> 03:46:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Now he was in his corner for a,</v>

8168
03:46:22.671 --> 03:46:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I watched warnings fight once and Draka you remember Draka?</v>

8169
03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I sure don't.</v>

8170
03:46:26.440 --> 03:46:28.120
<v Speaker 1>It was a like MMA,</v>

8171
03:46:28.121 --> 03:46:28.691
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

8172
03:46:28.691 --> 03:46:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you could take dudes down or kickboxing,</v>

8173
03:46:30.701 --> 03:46:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but you could take dudes down.</v>

8174
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.823
<v Speaker 1>It was real weird.</v>

8175
03:46:33.370 --> 03:46:35.830
<v Speaker 1>It was a just an alternative set of rules.</v>

8176
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8177
03:46:37.451 --> 03:46:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember any no.</v>

8178
03:46:38.580 --> 03:46:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Drunk?</v>

8179
03:46:39.220 --> 03:46:39.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8180
03:46:39.461 --> 03:46:42.510
<v Speaker 1>You remember that shit only terrible because you got to get used to it after a</v>

8181
03:46:42.511 --> 03:46:42.731
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

8182
03:46:42.731 --> 03:46:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of fun to say it again.</v>

8183
03:46:45.010 --> 03:46:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Draka and little bell tours any better.</v>

8184
03:46:47.850 --> 03:46:48.340
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

8185
03:46:48.340 --> 03:46:49.061
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>

8186
03:46:49.061 --> 03:46:49.894
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8187
03:46:51.480 --> 03:46:53.830
<v Speaker 1>like a kickboxing we take downs is a big part of it.</v>

8188
03:46:53.831 --> 03:46:54.670
<v Speaker 1>More ties all about,</v>
