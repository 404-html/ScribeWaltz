<v Speaker 1>I'm a ted fellow this year and I went through a whole week of people telling me</v>

11
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:19.531
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>

12
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>where to be and it was like being at a fucking Scientology summer camp.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Like before you go there,</v>

21
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>like you need to participate in Ted,</v>

22
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.111
<v Speaker 1>you need to beat them.</v>

23
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:32.461
<v Speaker 1>Like all right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

25
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I figure like mines are reasonable.</v>

26
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>If you have to do something in La,</v>

27
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:38.371
<v Speaker 1>you can go do something.</v>

28
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>In La,</v>

29
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I gave them like four or five days of my time.</v>

30
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I was there every single 13 hours.</v>

31
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Like every day they have 13 hours of fucking activities.</v>

32
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>They have mapped out for you some days,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

35
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>If you go to their after events and I'm like that's way too much fucking human</v>

36
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>interaction days.</v>

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>What does the other stuff they have for you?</v>

43
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>They want you to be available for like networking,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you need to be available.</v>

46
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:13.261

00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I put people on,</v>

51
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>like I put them in touch with ad agency people,</v>

52
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I put them in touch with other people to do business with other artists,</v>

53
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>introducing everyone and I thought I was good.</v>

70
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they don't pay that's incense and go to do it for the love and they want you for</v>

76
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>seven days,</v>

77
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>12 to 15 hours a day,</v>

78
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just leave to go do something.</v>

79
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Some work that you have to do.</v>

80
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>

82
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

84
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>what is it where people fuck up everything.</v>

85
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Even something as amazing as Ted,</v>

86
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>because Ted,</v>

87
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first Ted talk that I ever saw on the Internet a couple of years</v>

88
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

89
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>We have a whole ted thread on my message board about great,</v>

90
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>great ted episodes.</v>

92
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:24.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Like the one how to be happy is great.</v>

94
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

95
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>there's so many of them all.</v>

96
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:33.051
<v Speaker 1>But Graham Hancock just gave one in the war and consciousness about Iowasca and,</v>

97
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>and his own problems with,</v>

98
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>kicking cannabis.</v>

100
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>He had like a crazy weed habit where he's high all day every day for like</v>

101
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

102
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And then electra was,</v>

103
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>it was a crutch for them.</v>

104
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>It was like a real problem.</v>

105
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

106
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.841
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

107
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Ted Talk about it though.</v>

108
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>There's so much good stuff,</v>

109
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but then you hear shit like this and you're like,</v>

110
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>even they suck.</v>

111
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Like even if someone finds a way to fuck up,</v>

112
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>even something as amazing as Ted.</v>

113
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

114
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>the speakers are great.</v>

115
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>

116
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't say damn bad thing.</v>

117
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Every single one of the fellows is like inspirational,</v>

118
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:02.711
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

119
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.544
<v Speaker 1>doing great work.</v>

120
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.443
<v Speaker 1>The thing is though,</v>

121
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>something gets so good and people feel the power that they have and then they</v>

122
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>impose rules and that's how society got created in the beginning.</v>

123
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Somebody got so liked and got so much power that they could force you to do</v>

124
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>things that were entirely unnatural than inhuman.</v>

125
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.050
<v Speaker 1>That's so ridiculous too.</v>

126
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:24.051
<v Speaker 1>To think that a guy like you who's as busy as you could give up that time and be</v>

127
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>angry if you vary from their schedule at all,</v>

128
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:29.990
<v Speaker 1>that that sounds like it's more to,</v>

129
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>I think Ted's a racist [inaudible] kind of crazy too.</v>

130
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Cause other people missed and they kind of picked on me for it.</v>

131
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>But even before I got out here I was like,</v>

132
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:38.471
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

133
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>my birthday is Friday.</v>

134
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>You want me to stay till Saturday?</v>

135
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Can I at least have my girls stay with me?</v>

136
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

137
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just use the room like,</v>

138
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>oh we can't because you have a roommate at tet,</v>

139
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>so you're like 30 40 year old people staying with a roommate.</v>

140
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

141
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

142
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.481
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

143
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

144
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>They make you room with people?</v>

145
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>

146
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>how can they do that?</v>

147
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.650
<v Speaker 1>They won't tell you who to sleep with.</v>

148
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.181
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

149
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

150
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

151
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you have to room.</v>

152
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the Ted experience.</v>

153
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.381
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

154
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>this is a court at this point you have crossed the threshold.</v>

155
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>You're now fucking Scientology.</v>

156
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

157
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

158
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>So they assign you,</v>

159
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:10.481
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

160
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:11.314
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

161
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.620
<v Speaker 1>we think that Eddie would grow if he lived with Sasha for a week.</v>

162
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>So some crazy fuck.</v>

164
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Who's a Sasha Shogun,</v>

165
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>who's in there cooking up crystal meth and whatever the fuck he's doing.</v>

166
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

167
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.820
<v Speaker 1>you would have to stay with that guy.</v>

168
00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

169
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean luckily they put me with this dude software who is amazing.</v>

170
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Cool cat.</v>

171
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I was calling software.</v>

172
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>you were really to be able to pull the name of the dude is amazing.</v>

174
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>His name was software and I stayed with him,</v>

175
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

176
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 I haven't stayed in a hotel with people in a minute.</v>

177
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>You know how big is the hotel?</v>

178
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a small shitty hotel.</v>

179
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest reasons he looks like a fucking airport hotel in La.</v>

180
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>So you bought,</v>

181
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you're like in the bed next to this guy,</v>

182
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>so you got to hear each other snore.</v>

183
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

184
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that?</v>

185
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And they also hold this shit at long beach and it's like next to like across the</v>

186
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:58.211
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

187
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>literally you have back to back outback pf Chang's and like subway.</v>

188
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.241
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous,</v>

189
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>but the whole thing is just weird.</v>

190
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

191
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay for my own room.</v>

192
00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

193
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

194
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.034
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed.</v>

195
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

196
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to pay for your own room.</v>

197
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

198
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>they're crazy.</v>

199
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>They just want to control you.</v>

200
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>

201
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So I still love the talks.</v>

202
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I love all the speakers,</v>

203
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>but the organization is fucked.</v>

204
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious that they think that they can have that kind of influence over</v>

205
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

206
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the Ted experience.</v>

207
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Eddie is part of the Ted experience.</v>

208
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the Ted Experience to get Paul that no one's talked about this</v>

209
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>before because this seems like straight up boy scouts.</v>

210
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You know what is the thing is most people,</v>

211
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>they need 10 they need Ted to put you on.</v>

212
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>They want the co sign.</v>

213
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:39.851
<v Speaker 1>And most people,</v>

214
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

215
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>if you do something for me,</v>

216
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I won't say anything about you.</v>

217
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

218
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:43.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

219
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:44.141
<v Speaker 1>I think Joe,</v>

220
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:44.974
<v Speaker 1>you're the same way.</v>

221
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what you do for me.</v>

222
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fucking Weirdo and you're about to start some new Colt conference</v>

223
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

224
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say something.</v>

225
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

226
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to follow your rules.</v>

227
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I would write a book about this if I try.</v>

228
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>They actually tried to get me to do what they wanted me to do for four,</v>

229
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.371
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

230
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:01.701
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

231
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.151
<v Speaker 1>seven days,</v>

232
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was and not paying you.</v>

233
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>They send packets to to be like this is how to network with billionaires.</v>

234
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

235
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Like how to go to a network with billionaires,</v>

236
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>how to go to a network and talk to people and like talk to potential people who</v>

237
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>could collaborate and work with you.</v>

238
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

239
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>don't just go ask them for money.</v>

240
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

241
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

242
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.923
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

243
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Just go ask them for money and it's in the packets and you're a grown ass man</v>

244
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>and they pick you like you're obviously intelligent if you're getting picked for</v>

245
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>10 and they're like today when it rains you should pack a punch.</v>

246
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>It's wild.</v>

247
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.441
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

248
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:33.851
<v Speaker 1>That holds.</v>

249
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 1>That is harder.</v>

250
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

251
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>What that is is exactly the opposite of the vehicle that got them there and the</v>

252
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>vehicle that got them there is the Internet.</v>

253
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>What got them there is the fact that the freedom of the Internet allows people</v>

254
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>to exchange interesting conversations like that.</v>

255
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:48.561
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

256
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>you got to listen to this.</v>

257
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.121
<v Speaker 1>You got to wash us.</v>

258
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>This lady gave the speech on monkeys.</v>

259
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:52.461
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

260
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you and what they did is the exact opposite of that.</v>

261
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's why even though Obama was focusing on gun control,</v>

262
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the most important debate that Americans will face in the next five years is</v>

263
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.163
<v Speaker 1>internet freedom.</v>

264
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Internet freedom is the most important debate we will face.</v>

265
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>And we heard so fucking blind to it because the lobbyists are doing it under</v>

266
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>like under our noses.</v>

267
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

268
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:11.991
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

269
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:16.991
<v Speaker 1>you surely should have the right and ability to put your own website up and</v>

270
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>control your own content and express yourself any in any way shape,</v>

271
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>form you choose.</v>

272
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 1>And the benefits of that have been staggering to our culture over the last</v>

273
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.530
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>

274
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>just over the last 10 you know,</v>

275
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that corporations might have the ability to step in and stop that</v>

276
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>or regulate that or restrict that or sensor you if in anything that you do and</v>

277
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another if anything you do in somehow or another one way or a forms</v>

278
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 1>cost them money and they decide that this is something that has to be stopped,</v>

279
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to do that unless we do something and once somebody</v>

280
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>realizes that they have their hand on the faucet and they have the ability to</v>

281
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>turn it on and turn it off,</v>

282
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 1>people get crazy.</v>

283
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that study guide like these 10 people,</v>

284
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>they even BlocPower yeah,</v>

285
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>they do this shit where they invite these people to go talk and they actually</v>

286
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>don't put up everybody's talks until this year.</v>

287
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>They used to pick and choose and cherry pick the talks they'd put up and you</v>

288
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>would go there for a week,</v>

289
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>15 hours a day,</v>

290
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>do all their shit,</v>

291
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and then imagine if they didn't put up your talk,</v>

292
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but what have you talk socks.</v>

293
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>If you're talk sucked,</v>

294
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it should just go suck on the Internet.</v>

295
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Like it'll go hide in a corner on the Internet.</v>

296
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

297
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>But maybe yes and no,</v>

298
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>because if you like,</v>

299
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>say if you had a comedy conference and uh,</v>

300
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>you had all these comedians do sets,</v>

301
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but some of them were just dog shit.</v>

302
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>You want that set to represent your,</v>

303
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.081
<v Speaker 1>your company.</v>

304
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:42.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

305
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:42.951
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

306
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.784
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.683
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't do it.</v>

308
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

309
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:45.914
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

310
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>if I did though,</v>

312
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>invite someone and they stayed for a week and I didn't pay them,</v>

313
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.201
<v Speaker 1>I would be like,</v>

314
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>the least I owe you is the opportunity that quite possibly there's three people</v>

315
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:56.600
<v Speaker 1>on the planet at that enjoy your stuff.</v>

316
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

317
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:57.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.621
<v Speaker 1>That's one point.</v>

319
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:58.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

320
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.401
<v Speaker 1>That's a point.</v>

321
00:08:59.401 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

322
00:08:59.730 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

323
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying to protect the brand.</v>

324
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>It makes a little sense,</v>

325
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

326
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:03.871
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

327
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>most people's talks are fucking good.</v>

328
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:05.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>They're there for a reason.</v>

330
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably really different.</v>

331
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to get an open miker Ted talker.</v>

332
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

333
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bringer show.</v>

334
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.893
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

335
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 1>But they give opportunities to a lot of weird people mean it's absolutely</v>

336
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:16.810
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

337
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.643
<v Speaker 1>There must be,</v>

338
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I bet if we just ask,</v>

339
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I bet we're ignorant to it.</v>

340
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 1>But we just say,</v>

341
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.960

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.553
<v Speaker 1>She gave us,</v>

352
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>they never let it out cause she made fun of Ted.</v>

353
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.670
<v Speaker 1>See I would have fucking wanted to watch that to meet your weekly and the thing</v>

354
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>is if your confidence that you're allow you,</v>

355
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>you can laugh at yourself.</v>

356
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to laugh at themselves.</v>

357
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:45.781
<v Speaker 1>She made fun of Ted.</v>

358
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

359
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Like during her talk,</v>

360
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like the mythology of it.</v>

361
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the talk obviously,</v>

362
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>but how was the Sarah Silverman,</v>

363
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:52.531
<v Speaker 1>Ted Talk?</v>

364
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.364

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.353
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

366
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.193
<v Speaker 1>We need to get serious.</v>

367
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I need to run into her somewhere.</v>

368
00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

369
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't make it happen.</v>

370
00:09:59.610 --> 00:09:59.791
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

371
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.624
<v Speaker 1>Am I going to happen hurt?</v>

372
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

373
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

374
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

375
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anything bad about ted before,</v>

376
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's why this is such a shock.</v>

377
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>It is weird though.</v>

378
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You meet the donors and stuff and they can't tell Asian people apart.</v>

379
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 1>They can't tell African people apart and it's just,</v>

380
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>it's weird man.</v>

381
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Like they're nice and everybody means well.</v>

382
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Did they call you David Cho?</v>

383
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:20.281
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

384
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>They just mistake you for other fellows because so many of them are Asian.</v>

385
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

386
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.041
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

387
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

388
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 1>How many different people do it every year?</v>

389
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

390
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>every year they pick like 20 fellows and then they pick a bunch of other people</v>

391
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>for the main stage.</v>

392
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

393
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

394
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:34.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

395
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

396
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>it is a ill organization.</v>

397
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.381
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

398
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 1>even though they booted me today,</v>

399
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

400
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I love the speakers.</v>

401
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I love the talks and I want it to continue,</v>

402
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 1>but I hope that they,</v>

403
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:44.390
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>

404
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>they can say I suck and that's fine.</v>

406
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:46.780
<v Speaker 1>They can be like,</v>

407
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's a shithead.</v>

408
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.301
<v Speaker 1>He went to la,</v>

409
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>he did the fucking podcast and he sucks,</v>

410
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 1>but I hope they just changed the rules for future people.</v>

411
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't do anything wrong.</v>

412
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.360
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy and all they represent is a distribution method for the greatest</v>

413
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 1>minds on earth.</v>

414
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>That's all they represent.</v>

415
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they are the greatest minds on earth,</v>

416
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just there's so many interesting people today.</v>

417
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 1>We live in an amazing time.</v>

418
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And just when you good,</v>

419
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>something like Ted,</v>

420
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever the Ted stands for,</v>

421
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 1>it became synonymous on the Internet with fascinating talks.</v>

422
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

423
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

424
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.893
<v Speaker 1>And then it's off.</v>

425
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>But if you want you could do to Eddie Wong's,</v>

426
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>fascinating motherfuckers on vice and do the exact same thing.</v>

428
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of room for that.</v>

429
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Cause conferences like I would love to hear more people from,</v>

430
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

431
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.151
<v Speaker 1>downtown La,</v>

432
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 1>downtown New York and talking and doing these ideas because they don't find</v>

433
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:36.301
<v Speaker 1>those dudes.</v>

434
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>They find academics,</v>

435
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 1>they find people playing ancient instruments.</v>

436
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>They find people that are,</v>

437
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:41.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>working nature things and they have their kind of like cultural sect,</v>

439
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

440
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But there is a lot of room to find genius in other places,</v>

441
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>geniuses everywhere.</v>

442
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.943
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>

443
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you travel around the world,</v>

444
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you find genius anywhere.</v>

445
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's room for conferences that like look under different cultures cause</v>

446
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of looking under the same stones all the time.</v>

447
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.841
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

448
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to run out of bugs.</v>

449
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.503
<v Speaker 1>And I'm one of the,</v>

451
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the first time they've stepped out to be like,</v>

452
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:04.500
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

453
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.350
<v Speaker 1>there's this dude,</v>

454
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.101
<v Speaker 1>he's Chinese,</v>

455
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:06.821
<v Speaker 1>he's into hip hop.</v>

456
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>He lives in downtown New York.</v>

457
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>He used to sell drugs.</v>

458
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 1>He now has a restaurant.</v>

459
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

460
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I think I was the only working chef that was a ted fellow.</v>

461
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

462
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I was one of their choices that was really out there,</v>

463
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but it just didn't work out but didn't work out because you're not willing to be</v>

464
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.980
<v Speaker 1>a fucking slave and sleep in a hotel room with a stranger for a week.</v>

465
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

466
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.121
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

467
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 1>They had me.</v>

468
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I rehearsed for two days.</v>

469
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I fucking did the tour.</v>

470
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I did everything I'm supposed to do,</v>

471
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and then I was like,</v>

472
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just piece out for like a half day and they bugged.</v>

473
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:32.471
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

474
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:33.304
<v Speaker 1>You know you.</v>

475
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

476
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.743
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

477
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's fact that they don't pay you.</v>

478
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

479
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 1>You guys need to do a vice show.</v>

480
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Exposing Ted how?</v>

481
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Loony tabs.</v>

482
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I told vice that I told,</v>

483
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I said before I got booted,</v>

484
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I sent them an email like,</v>

485
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:44.861
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

486
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you got to see this shit.</v>

487
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like the beginnings of Scientology.</v>

488
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

489
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It is so true that once people have a position of power and influence and people</v>

490
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>want to be a part of them,</v>

491
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>people go corrupt.</v>

492
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.513
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

493
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>What is the threshold at which something becomes a religion?</v>

494
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

495
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of insane.</v>

496
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to start a cult today.</v>

497
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

498
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.790
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people looking at jump on board.</v>

499
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.390
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

500
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 1>All the people that would have a hundred years ago become Catholics now.</v>

501
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:14.111
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

502
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:14.944
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

503
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I just won't stop fucking kids.</v>

504
00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

505
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I needed a new cult.</v>

506
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

507
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 1>People still believe in these.</v>

508
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Really like you look at what these people are doing.</v>

509
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Like what these,</v>

510
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in the Catholic church.</v>

511
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

512
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Fucking popes resigning.</v>

513
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause the first time it's gotten so hot that the pope's like I'm Outta here.</v>

514
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>He's asked for immunity from the Catholic,</v>

515
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:34.511
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

516
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:34.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

517
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Italian government,</v>

518
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 1>from prosecution because he's responsible for shielding pedophiles.</v>

519
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 1>He personally,</v>

520
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people don't know this,</v>

521
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>the pope personally responsible for taking pedophiles and shifting them away to</v>

522
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 1>another place where they molested markets.</v>

523
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.130
<v Speaker 1>And what would you expect?</v>

524
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

525
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 1>these people aren't allowed to have sex.</v>

526
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It's natural to want to have sex.</v>

527
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.430
<v Speaker 1>It's natural to want to go to La and do podcasts.</v>

528
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:57.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

529
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.030
<v Speaker 1>soon you cannot come to Ted and have sex without condoms.</v>

530
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:01.391
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

531
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

532
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.140
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine no unprotected sex.</v>

533
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 1>No raw dogging.</v>

534
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Attend illegal.</v>

535
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 1>No Ass fucking while you're here.</v>

536
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.783
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

537
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.073
<v Speaker 1>Ted Fellow.</v>

538
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.943
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a mutiny.</v>

539
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they would have like you,</v>

540
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>you could slowly start imposing behavior standards,</v>

541
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:17.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:18.071
<v Speaker 1>on fellows,</v>

543
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:18.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:19.960
<v Speaker 1>if you want to call it like a ted fellow or,</v>

545
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>or whatever new organization you want to start,</v>

546
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.691
<v Speaker 1>they do shit.</v>

547
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you should have a standing,</v>

548
00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you should give a standing ovation when this person comes,</v>

549
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you should do this and that.</v>

550
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:27.643
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

551
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

552
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.291
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

553
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

554
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Fake standing ovations.</v>

555
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

556
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 1>And they were also saying like,</v>

557
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:33.791
<v Speaker 1>when the founder comes,</v>

559
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Chris Anderson comes like,</v>

560
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to give him a standing ovation.</v>

561
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

562
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:38.470
<v Speaker 1>it's nice if you want to,</v>

564
00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't actually need you to do it.</v>

565
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

566
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you needed to give me this fake halfway disclaimer is so fucking</v>

567
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

568
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:45.821
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

569
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:47.130
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>

570
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>They tell you who to and not to give standing ovations to who's allowed to</v>

572
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:52.761
<v Speaker 1>apply.</v>

573
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:55.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to apply to go to Ted to attend.</v>

574
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And then once you're accepted,</v>

575
00:14:56.421 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you pay $8,000.</v>

576
00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

577
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a mind fuck.</v>

578
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

579
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.690
