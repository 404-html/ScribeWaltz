00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>this is a period where I was doing a lot of psychedelics and one of the</v>

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>experiences you've probably had on psychedelics is the,</v>

5
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the amazing experience of just looking into someone's eyes on acid or mushrooms</v>

6
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:19.431
<v Speaker 1>and just having that just open a kind of inner landscape of profundity you're</v>

7
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>seeming profundity where you're just,</v>

8
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:21.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>you can just be staring into someone's eyes silently for an eternity or what</v>

10
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>seems like an eternity.</v>

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>what often happens to people is that after having experiences like this,</v>

13
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>then looking into people's eyes can become a way of really,</v>

14
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

16
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

17
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>kind of activating that state of mind where,</v>

18
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you just being committed to looking into people's eyes and never looking away</v>

20
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>can be a way of sort of introducing that sort of liquid psychedelic experience,</v>

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:50.941
<v Speaker 1>interpersonally.</v>

23
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>And I was sort of into that to,</v>

24
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>for a while and um,</v>

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>so I was kind of walking through life,</v>

30
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

32
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like a Tom cruise does basically.</v>

33
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

34
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

35
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Just never just like,</v>

36
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.391
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

37
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go with it.</v>

38
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's see where this goes and I'm just never going to look away from anyone ever</v>

39
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.874
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

40
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And you get.</v>

41
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.731
<v Speaker 1>You start having,</v>

42
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's intrusive and I stopped doing it,</v>

43
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

44
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you start having unusual experiences.</v>

45
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you do is you discover everyone else is doing that for whatever</v>

46
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

47
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>So all of the psychopaths and the scientologists and all,</v>

48
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone comes out of the woodwork because there there's some number of people</v>

49
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>walking around earth at this moment who are playing that game who are just all.</v>

50
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like you look into their eyes and it's just I lock for as long as you're</v>

51
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>going to stay and they're never gonna look away and so whether it's a Barista at</v>

52
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>starbucks or whether it's just somebody who is,</v>

53
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>50 feet across the room at a party and you make eye contact,</v>

55
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be the first one to look away.</v>

56
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>And so you get into these really weird encounters.</v>

57
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:55.861
<v Speaker 1>And I had this.</v>

58
00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember this one party I went to where I was sitting on a couch and I looked</v>

59
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>across the room and there was this guy looking at me and I</v>

60
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

61
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>40 feet between us and he looked at me and I looked at him and then it was just</v>

63
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:15.681
<v Speaker 1>like war of the warlocks know neither of us were going to look away.</v>

64
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

65
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>And it just be that.</v>

66
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing a lot of meditation and I was uh,</v>

67
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

69
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>it was probably uh,</v>

70
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>taking acid once a month,</v>

72
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>so I was,</v>

74
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty tuned up for this kind of game where it's just like a,</v>

75
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I was not,</v>

77
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I had no problem with making eye contact with some strange guy,</v>

78
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:33.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:34.494
<v Speaker 1>40 feet away.</v>

80
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>and after a certain point he jumped up and kind of raced over to me and know we</v>

82
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>had a problem.</v>

83
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.301
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

84
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

85
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

86
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

87
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a real,</v>

88
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>is what I was doing was so intrusive.</v>

89
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

90
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>he had his own game going because he,</v>

91
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>he didn't look away,</v>

93
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>He was available for it.</v>

95
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>But in any case when you walk through life like this,</v>

96
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.230
<v Speaker 1>you discover that there are a lot of people doing this for,</v>

97
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.</v>

98
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

99
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.433
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

100
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>You definitely have unusual encounters.</v>

101
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.471
<v Speaker 1>Hello Joe,</v>

102
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.320
<v Speaker 1>for Fuck Sake.</v>

103
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Look at you sitting up there and your high.</v>

104
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>He asked me if I was David Letterman and tell everybody about this chair.</v>

105
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>This is my latest device to try to mitigate back pain from sitting.</v>

106
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's called the,</v>

107
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called a sally.</v>

108
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] s a l l I.</v>

110
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>and it's a saddle chair.</v>

111
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a saddle.</v>

112
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.430
<v Speaker 1>So if you see how it's sitting here at.</v>

113
00:03:29.431 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

114
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>no one's endorsing this.</v>

115
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you it feels I'm going to tell you this.</v>

116
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>They would hate me endorsing this because it feels like shit.</v>

117
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like the least comfortable chair I think I've ever sat at.</v>

118
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's very good for your back and make sure you like,</v>

119
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you can't sit any way other than like this.</v>

120
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to sit straight up,</v>

121
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>you can't slouch in this thing.</v>

122
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't support it.</v>

123
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>And when I sit in a regular chair by the end of the podcast,</v>

124
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>my fucking neck starts to hurt my back.</v>

125
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Like around here where I've been injured,</v>

126
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.713
<v Speaker 1>starts to hurt.</v>

127
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Like stretch your asshole out though.</v>

128
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And like give that to I'm trying to do.</v>

129
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for me if I ever do wind up going in the pokey.</v>

130
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to be just gaping soon.</v>

131
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

133
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't do anything in your asshole.</v>

134
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:15.934
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiot.</v>

135
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.490
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting now.</v>

136
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

137
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I know this is,</v>

138
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.823
<v Speaker 1>you're not listening.</v>

139
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea behind this is,</v>

140
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like a saddle.</v>

141
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.551
<v Speaker 1>If you sit in the saddle,</v>

142
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you actually kind of have to hold yourself in place.</v>

143
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>So by squeezing your legs together,</v>

144
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not opening your butthole.</v>

145
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.110
