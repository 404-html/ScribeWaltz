<v Speaker 1>He survived the Joey Diaz experience.</v>

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 2>attacks from Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

10
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said because he asked me,</v>

11
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>we were backstage about to go onstage at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main room and he's like,</v>

12
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 2>I want you to do my podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

14
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 2>And then we were texting just about my </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule with him and then he's.</v>

15
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

16
00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go see Joey Diaz de da.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

17
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking gummy bears.</v>

18
00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Watch out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

19
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:43.810
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like,</v>

20
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand what he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

21
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

22
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly didn't like,</v>

23
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

24
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once I got there,</v>

25
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoke weed sometimes,</v>

26
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't smoke all the time but I like to</v>

27
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 2>smoke weed sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 2>but as far as the edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Dean Gelber is like given me some</v>

29
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 2>pot stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like cookies and shit,</v>

30
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 2>but then like he was eating these gummy </v>
<v Speaker 2>bears and they're in,</v>

31
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 2>in a bag and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

32
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

33
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 2>And he gave me just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 2>he gave me just like an ear or some shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was it.</v>

35
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:21.781
<v Speaker 2>And then I was just like talking to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like literally I couldn't talk </v>

36
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.441
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't talk part of it right at a </v>

37
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 2>half a one I had to leave.</v>

38
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>He's got some that are like 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams,</v>

39
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>which is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably had half of that,</v>

40
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>which is like 250,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking insane.</v>

41
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>That's an insane amount of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

42
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>

43
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 2>But I had done mushrooms once before </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger and it felt like </v>

44
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

45
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the risk of repeating myself</v>

46
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do all the time.</v>

47
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.981
<v Speaker 1>But when you eat marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's processed by your liver and it </v>

48
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>produces something called 11 hydroxy </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolite.</v>

49
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance sets,</v>

50
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>four to five times more psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>than thc.</v>

51
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it hits you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people think they got </v>

52
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>dosed because when you smoke pot that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

53
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you eat it,</v>

54
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>it's processed by your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something called a one pass.</v>

55
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it produces that.</v>

56
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't believe he let me drive </v>

57
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

58
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could like.</v>

59
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Because when I was driving home I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

60
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>

61
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I stopped that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't answer your questions.</v>

62
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>And then I said let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go.</v>

63
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 2>And I left and I drove out and he like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he let me drive.</v>

64
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

65
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>you got to understand Joey Diaz found </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mother dead on the kitchen floor </v>

66
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.341
<v Speaker 1>when he was on acid when he was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would let you fly a fucking plane on </v>

67
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a shit.</v>

68
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll figure it out.</v>

69
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

70
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So when did it hit you?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fifteen minutes into it and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

73
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop.</v>

74
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just released the podcast.</v>

75
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he did the audio but not the </v>

76
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.740
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

77
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I told them not to do it.</v>

78
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't answer any questions,</v>

79
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 3>but wouldn't that be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

80
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

81
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see myself that fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up where I can't even talk.</v>

82
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

83
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 3>those edibles are fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying.</v>

84
00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

85
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skittles or some shit.</v>

86
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a different type of human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

87
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of those people now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because edibles and marijuana has been </v>

88
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.671
<v Speaker 3>legal for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many medical patients in </v>

89
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.401
<v Speaker 3>California that you get these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have insane tolerances and they're </v>

90
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 3>just doing dabs and eaten cookies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Jesus,</v>

91
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Speaker 3>just like they go down</v>

92
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.380
<v Speaker 2>unit the whole marijuana movement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing is so much different.</v>

93
00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Different when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was growing up,</v>

94
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I grew up,</v>

95
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 2>we still like smoke it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd go to the beach and we put a towel </v>

96
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.950
<v Speaker 2>over us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd hide it now.</v>

97
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like last night I was at the,</v>

98
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.870

<v Speaker 3>that a woman was doing an impression of </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

121
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.260
<v Speaker 3>should go and do an impression and trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>now because of that.</v>

122
00:04:58.261 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

124

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

125
00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

126
00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I did a special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it like,</v>

128
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 2012 for showtime </v>
<v Speaker 2>called politics where I went to DC and I</v>

129
00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 2>did stand up in DC and I interviewed all</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul.</v>

130
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I love politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's all I watch when I come home</v>

131
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I watch is CNN,</v>

132
00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:21.350
<v Speaker 2>msn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Fox just because that's it.</v>

133
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm in shock and I can't believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

134
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go back and forth that there's so</v>

135
00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:28.160
<v Speaker 2>many fucked up things that are going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

136
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.830
<v Speaker 2>The whole North Korea thing is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>

137
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's</v>

138
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Gary is that Donald trump is saying shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fire and fury that the world has </v>

139
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 3>never known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Jesus Dude,</v>

140
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 3>like this isn't a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is real life.</v>

141
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean this North Korean guys </v>

142
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 2>fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking nuts.</v>

143
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

144
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:52.881
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop shooting fucking missiles in the </v>

145
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:52.881
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like a playpen thing.</v>

146
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:54.930
<v Speaker 2>He just kept shooting missiles in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean all the time.</v>

147
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like he's like a kid or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and kid.</v>

148
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

149
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think Guam is only like 2000 </v>

150
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 2>miles away from North Korea or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real close.</v>

151
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.720
<v Speaker 2>So they're talking about him possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombing Guam and that's what they're </v>

152
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.290
<v Speaker 2>saying now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know I've been watching,</v>

153
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't a death sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>

154
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 2>if we decided to attack North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a death sentence to them.</v>

155
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 2>And then also I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know,</v>

156
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.350
<v Speaker 2>I know Dennis Rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis,</v>

157
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.890
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you talk to him when he went over </v>

158
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.890
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know like,</v>

159
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get too too into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that he goes over there a </v>

160
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

161
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he meets with Kim Jones,</v>

162
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>Aau basketball or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fucking get drunk and I don't </v>

163
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go on jet skis or some shit.</v>

164
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

165
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

166
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes Dennis Rodman so it brings them</v>

167
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:53.261
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from what I heard is that Kim Jong </v>

168
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:53.261
<v Speaker 2>Goon really loves Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

169
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his American,</v>

170
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.800
<v Speaker 2>he loves America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's kind of acting like he doesn't </v>

171
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 2>love America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he loves the American way.</v>

172
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.840
<v Speaker 2>So my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I think I really think that if Donald</v>

174
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Trump went over there to meet with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

175
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I think that would appease him and show </v>
<v Speaker 2>him the fuck out.</v>

176
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should be like a liaison.</v>

177
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

178
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he gets,</v>

179
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.070
<v Speaker 2>he gets uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

180
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 2>he goes over there and hangs out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they.</v>

181
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Kim Jong Un kid loves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loves,</v>

182
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 2>loves American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

183
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>He loves America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Kinda like a weird,</v>

184
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

185
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

186
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.890
<v Speaker 2>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

187
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no kind of modification.</v>

188
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not communicating right.</v>

189
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's language barrier obviously,</v>

190
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young.</v>

191
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Isn't Kim Jong Goon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in his thirties.</v>

192
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 2>How old is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

193
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mean.</v>

194
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Imagine running a military dictatorship </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your thirties and he's already </v>

195
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A gang of people are already in.</v>

196
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's so crazy about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing is that like you think of </v>

197
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Isis and you think of that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how those people like,</v>

198
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 2>they don't care to die and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>care if they're going to die and I think</v>

199
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 2>that he's trained his people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the CBC,</v>

200
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>all it's on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You this marching soldiers.</v>

201
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I think those guys are ready to die.</v>

202
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in a shit hole like North </v>

203
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Korea where everyday you're under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive of a military dictatorship,</v>

204
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:30.671
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'd be ready to die to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's either escape to South Korea </v>

205
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:30.671
<v Speaker 2>or die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

206
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what had happened is I think </v>

207
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.511
<v Speaker 2>trump should hire Dennis Rodman and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>put like a tracking device on them and </v>

208
00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>their jet skiing out in fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean drinking and shit.</v>

209
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And the seal team six comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking takes Kim Jong Buen flies into </v>

210
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:49.811
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives all the North Korean internet and </v>

211
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 2>like sets them free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

212
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.470
<v Speaker 2>this is like a movie dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you get it?</v>

213
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Was Stephen Baldwin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

214
00:08:56.631 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 2>but I that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that there's probably a way</v>

215
00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:00.430
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

216
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

217
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.290
<v Speaker 2>to chill everything.</v>

218
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.290
<v Speaker 1>The probably is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which everything out.</v>

219
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>This is not the way like launching test </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles and saying fire and fury and </v>

220
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.870
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

221
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.970
<v Speaker 1>not chilling anything out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

222
00:09:12.971 --> 00:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what the conflict is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in the first place.</v>

223
00:09:16.001 --> 00:09:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure what everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

224
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I think because they think that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to bomb them and we're going to </v>

225
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.070
<v Speaker 1>bomb them like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did years ago,</v>

226
00:09:24.071 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

227
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

228
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiroshima was Japan.</v>

229
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>The Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

230
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's part of the world,</v>

231
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:35.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be super psyched.</v>

232
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Conflate the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

234
00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean we did horrible things during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean War to the North Koreans.</v>

235
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's literally the cause of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

236
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.870
<v Speaker 1>All the anger and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 1>but that's when North Korea and South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea were split and North Korea went </v>

238
00:09:55.481 --> 00:09:57.610
<v Speaker 1>communists and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

239
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.650
<v Speaker 1>it's all a byproduct of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:04.651
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could read about it and actually </v>

241
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:04.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a really good book called dear </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader from Michael Malice.</v>

242
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:09.931
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who was on my podcast and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of that part of the world is </v>

243
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:13.741
<v Speaker 1>really fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting because you have </v>

244
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:14.140
<v Speaker 1>North Korea and then below you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea,</v>

245
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.750
<v Speaker 1>South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a thriving economy,</v>

246
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.770
<v Speaker 1>amazing electronic Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make all kinds of great shit over </v>

247
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his boss,</v>

248
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.270
<v Speaker 1>probably plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medica,</v>

249
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then North Korea is just right next </v>

250
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>door to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible dictatorship.</v>

251
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.170
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no president has been able to deal </v>

252
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

253
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 1>probably won't be able to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you resolve that?</v>

254
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that my mouse was </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me that makes it so fucked up is</v>

255
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>that everybody has to rat on everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

256
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you and I were working </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

257
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.280
<v Speaker 1>we would have to go somewhere and tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone what each one of us did wrong </v>

258
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.410
<v Speaker 1>during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you didn't try hard enough </v>

259
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>when somebody died or maybe you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited enough,</v>

260
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:02.780
<v Speaker 1>but something good happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't cheer loud enough and they'll,</v>

261
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:04.780
<v Speaker 1>they'll rat you out for that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you have to be accountable and then so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like a culture of rats.</v>

263
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's ratting everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

264
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.430
<v Speaker 2>sounds fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't realize how lucky we are,</v>

265
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in America would do.</v>

266
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>complained so much about stuff because </v>

267
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 2>we're so soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any slight little thing that's wrong.</v>

268
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Speaker 2>You ever been to prison before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

269
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.090
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

270
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I went to Alcatraz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to visit as a uh,</v>

271
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 2>never been arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think like spending time in </v>

272
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.361
<v Speaker 2>prison would make you appreciate just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the simple things because you always </v>

273
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always see like,</v>

274
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are incarcerated,</v>

275
00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:43.630
<v Speaker 2>they get out and they like see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunlight and they're like,</v>

276
00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:45.310
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking awesome.</v>

277
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.330
<v Speaker 2>And part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone should go to prison for</v>

278
00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>like a month just to kind of get that,</v>

279
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 3>get their normal freedoms taken away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from them.</v>

280
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually doing a benefit and I was </v>

281
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.051
<v Speaker 3>going to ask you if you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're in town at the </v>

282
00:12:04.051 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 3>comedy store for the innocence project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you familiar with them?</v>

283
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Innocent.</v>

<v Speaker 3>didn't commit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

293
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:26.790
<v Speaker 3>that whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm flying in from DC.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I got a great lineup.</v>

301
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 3>I got um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's on it already,</v>

302
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 3>but I was going to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he'd be into that.</v>

303
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 3>That'd be seen the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

304
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm flying in trouble yet,</v>

305
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:47.010
<v Speaker 3>so I want to raise money for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

306
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.100
<v Speaker 3>because I want to give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to give money back to these guys </v>

307
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.960
<v Speaker 3>because when they got into jail they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have anything and they're not </v>

308
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 3>given anything given like a dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

309
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they have to somehow or another</v>

310
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:03.961
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to sue to get some </v>
<v Speaker 3>compensation for the fact they were </v>

311
00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:07.411
<v Speaker 3>wrongly in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how'd you like to be in prison for </v>

312
00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.631
<v Speaker 3>20 years knowing you had nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it and there's people that are in </v>

313
00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 3>prison for killing your mom and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

314
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Imagine someone kills your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not you.</v>

315
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 3>And then you get arrested and go to jail</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

316
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

317
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.700
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fruit person at the end of the </v>

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done stuff with them before.</v>

353
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I actually did a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an anthony wiener sketch to,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did that when I play Anthony Wiener.</v>

356
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I did that about four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months ago.</v>

357
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 3>And then this thing came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just hit me up,</v>

358
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I do stuff for funny or die sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in this thing caught on and it went </v>

360
00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and I was on CNN and in,</v>

371
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:21.800

<v Speaker 3>Wiener I think is a comic.</v>

372
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a comic.</v>

373
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know it.</v>

374
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still committed to being the.</v>

375
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to be the mayor and he can't </v>

376
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.160
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't the latest scandal,</v>

377
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 3>he would've come close a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

378
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grazing spoke.</v>

381
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.630
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked up.</v>

382
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.700
<v Speaker 3>So you see I'm lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>OKC didn't give him any eating given any</v>

383
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Speaker 3>edible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to give at this point in </v>

384
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Speaker 3>the Joe Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

385
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go.</v>

386
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 3>He kept asking me questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't answer anything.</v>

387
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to do is to imagine if </v>

388
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.220
<v Speaker 3>everybody that I know do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time cigarette to the two I did </v>

389
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 3>two red bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't tell anyone,</v>

390
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard everyone kind of can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>handle it.</v>

391
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

392
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 3>the numbers of Joey puts up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No very few humans can handle it,</v>

393
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But don't you think back to Anthony </v>

394
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Wiener?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that guy should have been a </v>

395
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.561
<v Speaker 3>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's got this idea about what's </v>

396
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:19.871
<v Speaker 3>good and what's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a pervert under like the </v>

397
00:16:19.871 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 3>guise of comic Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great speaker.</v>

398
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's hilarious.</v>

399
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.210
<v Speaker 3>He obviously loves posting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly was supposed to.</v>

400
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking character.</v>

401
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that he's trapped in that </v>

402
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.310
<v Speaker 3>suppressed world of being a politician </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he obviously doesn't fit those </v>

403
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:41.621
<v Speaker 3>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those standards of behavior that they </v>

404
00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 3>demand of you that are all bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

405
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 3>but he's too fucked up.</v>

406
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.490
<v Speaker 3>He's too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the more fucked up things that </v>

407
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 3>people find out about the politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more popular they become.</v>

408
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Some of them I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

409
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in a way clean about it.</v>

410
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:57.130
<v Speaker 3>If he could come clean about all of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>until like the,</v>

411
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 3>but still in the day of trump things way</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

412
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because trump got elected a month after </v>

413
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.521
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbed them by the pussy thing came </v>

414
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:09.521
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody thought that was gonna sink as</v>

415
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:09.800
<v Speaker 3>both like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he still wins.</v>

416
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.400
<v Speaker 3>So I think the world is different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think wiener has the </v>

417
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 3>constitution that trump has trump say </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want about them,</v>

418
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:20.790
<v Speaker 3>but the motherfucker as teflon for skin </v>
<v Speaker 3>things just saying bounce right off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm Hawaiian tropics or the biggest </v>

447
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:21.771
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the girls and Fabio was there and </v>

<v Speaker 2>And because Donald trump used to go to </v>

451
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.801
<v Speaker 2>the Hawaiian Hawaiian tropic parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ron Rice used to throw after the </v>

452
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 2>spring break things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Donald Trump was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

454
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:45.600

<v Speaker 2>couple times at the playboy mansion.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he hasn't gotten anything.</v>

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Strange hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think?</v>

520
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 3>So there's like a basement that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in the White House.</v>

521
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.860
<v Speaker 3>There's no way he's getting vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

522
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.470
<v Speaker 3>So none of them do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of the presidents with modern </v>

525
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they can write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

526
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Clinton kind of fucked it up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

527
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.320

<v Speaker 3>like tar.</v>

532
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Imagine poor girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is 20 years old at this point.</v>

533
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I guess she's got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 3>99.</v>

553
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.730

<v Speaker 3>conversation with him.</v>

554
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:53.420
<v Speaker 3>It was always kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

555
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 3>we smiled at each other.</v>

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:01.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I never like went out to dinner with </v>

<v Speaker 3>apprentice.</v>

559
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:07.170
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to do celebrity apprentice</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they had the second integration of </v>

560
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.730
<v Speaker 3>fear factor when fear factor came back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 3>They're not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They consume you.</v>

586
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Good.</v>

587
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to continue doing this </v>

588
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.020
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name again?</v>

589
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Steven Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

590
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.280
<v Speaker 3>I guess if he keeps messing up and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want me to do it.</v>

591
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do a whole bunch of things </v>

592
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:37.270
<v Speaker 3>with Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

593
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:37.270
<v Speaker 3>And him explaining things to different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

594
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more if he messes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

595
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.710
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more if he goes on,</v>

596
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted them to get back on that </v>

597
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 3>press stage because once he's on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they start,</v>

598
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when he,</v>

599
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.320
<v Speaker 3>that's when he becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

600
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 3>was weird as is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When George Bush was president,</v>

601
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

602
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I was doing some shows in DC and me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dean Gilbert,</v>

603
00:24:57.381 --> 00:25:02.381
<v Speaker 3>we went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to the White House and we </v>

604
00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:05.051
<v Speaker 3>actually went into that room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pressroom and it's actually like </v>

605
00:25:05.051 --> 00:25:05.051
<v Speaker 3>fucking small.</v>

606
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been in it?</v>

607
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it on TV when they show up</v>

608
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:09.220
<v Speaker 3>from the back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

609
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.450
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like this big.</v>

610
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

611
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

612
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was to be grand.</v>

613
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

614
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.600
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the White House,</v>

615
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 3>did he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you been to the White House before?</v>

616
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the tourists walk there.</v>

617
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking weird.</v>

618
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's weird is how close it is</v>

619
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.740
<v Speaker 3>to this street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes by it,</v>

620
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drove by.</v>

621
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was back when people had </v>

622
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 3>muskets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

623
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.310
<v Speaker 3>like they really couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they built that stupid fucking </v>

624
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.540
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't give them enough space.</v>

625
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 3>If somebody just pulled up at a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>powered rifle,</v>

626
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.540
<v Speaker 3>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird that people like you </v>

627
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 3>watch house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great show,</v>

628
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because they're engaging in </v>

629
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of illicit activity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's windows everywhere.</v>

630
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 3>It's probably unrealistic but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

631
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 3>how many people have lived in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking house?</v>

632
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what's even weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

633
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.220
<v Speaker 3>45 different presidents all live in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>one spot.</v>

634
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

635
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have to be saying that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>to each other.</v>

636
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton or trump's got to be </v>

637
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.020
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

638
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Trump started saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the place that Bill Clinton got </v>

639
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.200
<v Speaker 3>blown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the area.</v>

640
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Look how close it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let go look in the left side.</v>

641
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And the right side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how close it is to the street.</v>

642
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you I can hit that with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with an arrow.</v>

643
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 3>You're going to DC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

644
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've done there August 27th.</v>

645
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Do you like dc?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like working there.</v>

646
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they feel like they need to blow</v>

647
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>some steam off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>

648
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kind of fun,</v>

649
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

650
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>as far as</v>

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.010
<v Speaker 2>your standup and stuff like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you know where peers you </v>

652
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.361
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see you and watch you and stuff </v>

653
00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:53.361
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At what point did,</v>

654
00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 2>did your stuff like just really start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow up?</v>

655
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really go from clubs because you're</v>

656
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 2>working in clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm working clubs and then all of a</v>

657
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:02.580
<v Speaker 2>sudden you now you're working like </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger places.</v>

658
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Like at what point was it about five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago?</v>

659
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Four years ago?</v>

660
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it the Netflix specials?</v>

661
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

662
00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Speaker 1>did theaters in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

663
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:17.720
<v Speaker 1>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine is all started changing in 2009.</v>

664
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.390
<v Speaker 1>That's when I did a comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 1>special on Spike TV first.</v>

665
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And then the TV and then comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

666
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I started doing bigger places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I started selling out theaters.</v>

667
00:27:28.301 --> 00:27:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Have like 2000 seats in some markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

668
00:27:32.591 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 1>take me like a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>

669
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.720
<v Speaker 1>then there was the next comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

670
00:27:37.721 --> 00:27:42.721
<v Speaker 1>That was another big bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was selling out places like the </v>

671
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Belko in Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like 5,000.</v>

672
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it takes,</v>

673
00:27:44.561 --> 00:27:46.600
<v Speaker 1>it would take a little longer to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

674
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 1>But now with the Netflix special changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that Netflix is just a </v>

675
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 1>completely different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

676
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.540
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people have Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man I know.</v>

677
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you're special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:27:58.211 --> 00:28:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really put together something good,</v>

679
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.340
<v Speaker 1>they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

680
00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:02.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

681
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.140
<v Speaker 1>he actually is a real comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really asked actually it's funny,</v>

682
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.630
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they want to come see you and </v>

683
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.630
<v Speaker 1>then it's your responsibility to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck them.</v>

684
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you do a good job and keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing new shit.</v>

685
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Constantly keep producing new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

686
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 2>But what does it feel like to be out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the clubs?</v>

687
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I still do clubs though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you're in,</v>

688
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you're playing bigger things bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that feel like to,</v>

689
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 2>you said Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

690
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.850
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fun and everything.</v>

691
00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a different kind of show </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

692
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's more pausing and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more theatrical year.</v>

693
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a bigger stage moving around more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really good to it.</v>

694
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's better,</v>

695
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better financially.</v>

696
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

697
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.210
<v Speaker 2>that must make you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>

699
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

700
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.820
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I played,</v>

701
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I played big places and I've also played</v>
<v Speaker 2>clubs,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

706
00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:03.170

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

707
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.690
<v Speaker 2>It's connected to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's intimate,</v>

708
00:29:05.691 --> 00:29:06.590
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

709
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 2>How often do you turn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm,</v>

710
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of go in spurts,</v>

711
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working a lot.</v>

712
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't work a lot at the store </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the week because I'm like so </v>

713
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.520
<v Speaker 2>exhausted from editing and I edit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>edit all day long and editing.</v>

714
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm editing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm well,</v>

715
00:29:24.921 --> 00:29:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I finished the show and crackle that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

716
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.080
<v Speaker 2>took a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show that's on now,</v>

717
00:29:30.081 --> 00:29:33.620
<v Speaker 2>that's on crackle and editing that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

718
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:38.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time on those videos </v>

719
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:38.650
<v Speaker 2>and then from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

720
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I did the documentary Polisher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands alone,</v>

721
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>which was on showtime and now it's on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>

722
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 2>That's just the straight doc that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a couple of years ago.</v>

723
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I had such a good time filming that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I kept shooting in.</v>

724
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is about me moving my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mom out of the house,</v>

725
00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:57.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the big house because when I did </v>

726
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.481
<v Speaker 2>the original docket was just kinda like </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of skimming the concept of that.</v>

727
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

728
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I got to start doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I cut into it.</v>

729
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a six part series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like my version of making the </v>

730
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 2>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't kill anyone obviously,</v>

731
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a six part series based off the</v>

732
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:18.001
<v Speaker 2>original doc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've been putting that together and </v>

733
00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude might not know.</v>

734
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.920
<v Speaker 2>So I think we posted second dope.</v>

735
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Your mom's probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

736
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 1>if not the most important characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever in the history of standup comedy,</v>

737
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:32.830
<v Speaker 1>like her running and owning the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store in the glory days of Kinison and </v>

738
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 1>prior and now today even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:38.910
<v Speaker 1>like she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she set the stage,</v>

740
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at all the people that helped me </v>

741
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and like were important to me and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

742
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Your mom was pretty uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant,</v>

743
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

744
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

745
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.020
<v Speaker 2>she created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:30:54.021 --> 00:30:56.810
<v Speaker 2>my dad and mom started the place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 72.</v>

747
00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I was four and then it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

748
00:31:01.161 --> 00:31:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And then they got divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She won the comedy store in the divorce.</v>

749
00:31:04.521 --> 00:31:06.320
<v Speaker 2>He says he gave it to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

750
00:31:06.321 --> 00:31:08.720
<v Speaker 2>there's still like a friction there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that concept.</v>

751
00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:14.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking four years old and then </v>

753
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 2>my mom became who she really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

754
00:31:16.371 --> 00:31:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you're a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedy.</v>

755
00:31:17.631 --> 00:31:22.631
<v Speaker 2>That's who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She became a creative kind of force and </v>

756
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:24.980
<v Speaker 2>she came in at the limelight at a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone needed someone like that.</v>

757
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of just like a club owner,</v>

758
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was creative,</v>

759
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I think part of the reason </v>

760
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.851
<v Speaker 2>why she's sick now is because she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was never like a real business </v>

761
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.010
<v Speaker 2>business person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

762
00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:39.500
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a woman so it was really hard.</v>

763
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she was so good at fucking like </v>

764
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne wear suspenders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

765
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Gary Shanley put a sweater on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

766
00:31:48.471 --> 00:31:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Just different things that she would </v>
<v Speaker 2>help develop.</v>

767
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.570
<v Speaker 2>And that to me is what the store is </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing now.</v>

768
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no mixing.</v>

769
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.780
<v Speaker 2>There's no Mitzi shore there to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>garnish these comments.</v>

770
00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I Love Adam to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just fucking doing an awesome job,</v>

771
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's not Mitzi shore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that to me is something that I think</v>

772
00:32:07.311 --> 00:32:10.110
<v Speaker 2>we have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's our responsibility,</v>

773
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:12.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of give back to younger guys and</v>

774
00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:17.831
<v Speaker 2>maybe spend a little more time there on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Monday night or something and really </v>

775
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:21.131
<v Speaker 2>kind of help these kids out and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>them some direction because there is no </v>

776
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:21.320
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no Mitzi shore there.</v>

777
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's who she is,</v>

778
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.150
<v Speaker 2>that's who she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's who she is.</v>

779
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that to me is what her best quality </v>

780
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.220
<v Speaker 2>quality was when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she first met my dad,</v>

781
00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:35.050
<v Speaker 2>it was in the fifties and my dad was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>touring comic and uh,</v>

782
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:40.090
<v Speaker 2>my dad did a show and a or a summer in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place called Outcart Lake Wisconsin and </v>

783
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:41.900
<v Speaker 2>he was doing all summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

784
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 2>that's what you did in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would play there.</v>

785
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:48.551
<v Speaker 2>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a camp and my mom worked for the </v>

786
00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:53.531
<v Speaker 2>boss of the camp and my mom used to type</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad's jokes in the back.</v>

787
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would type the jokes in the back.</v>

788
00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good,</v>

789
00:32:57.801 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

790
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.800
<v Speaker 2>And she would write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

791
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And then she would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stunk,</v>

792
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:03.950
<v Speaker 2>this was good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was good.</v>

793
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:08.951
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she just developed my help del </v>

794
00:33:08.951 --> 00:33:08.951
<v Speaker 2>Valle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad's act,</v>

795
00:33:08.951 --> 00:33:13.180
<v Speaker 2>they started dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had sex and then my dad took off </v>

796
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.410
<v Speaker 2>and then he was in Toledo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ohio and then got a call from my mom </v>

797
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 2>saying I'm pregnant with Scott.</v>

798
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.430
<v Speaker 2>And Scott's just turned 64,</v>
<v Speaker 2>65 years old.</v>

799
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

800
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.130
<v Speaker 2>so back then you have a kid whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to or you don't,</v>

801
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The abortion thing didn't really exist.</v>

802
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean it did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

803
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't never wanted a kid and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>never wanted to get married and he never</v>

804
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:38.870
<v Speaker 2>wanted all of his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want us.</v>

805
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to do what I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do,</v>

806
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 2>which was just bang vagina on the road,</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is which,</v>

808
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.570

<v Speaker 2>And that got taken from him.</v>

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:55.030
<v Speaker 1>So in his day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever talk to them about what it </v>

811
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.361
<v Speaker 1>was like to tour back then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it wasn't really comedy clubs </v>

812
00:33:58.361 --> 00:33:58.361
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

813
00:33:58.361 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

847
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.060

<v Speaker 2>that's fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>

849
00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:32.591
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they asked my mom and my mom's </v>

850
00:35:32.591 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 2>the one that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it the comedy store.</v>

851
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.540
<v Speaker 2>So she's the one who came up with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

852
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 2>So they started the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was like the Alcoholic Mc,</v>

853
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Big Time.</v>

855
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Like he loved Jmb was his favorite drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would go on stage and um,</v>

856
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 2>he'd bring up Red Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pat Mccormick,</v>

857
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

858
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynn Marie Langston,</v>

859
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these guys.</v>

860
00:35:57.241 --> 00:35:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my mom would work the cover booth,</v>

861
00:35:59.331 --> 00:35:59.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

862
00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Tommy used to work in that little area </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

863
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 2>And she used to give out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

864
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 2>like little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

865
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 2>peppermints and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

866
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 2>to the guests that would come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my dad would go on the road and</v>

867
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:16.521
<v Speaker 2>open for Elvis and open for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inglebert Humperdink and Sammy Davis and</v>

868
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Sinatra and all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my mom's always started to take over</v>

869
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:22.920
<v Speaker 2>the club while he was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like her heart,</v>

870
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

871
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

872
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 2>she put her heart into the club and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda where it started.</v>

873
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Speaker 2>And they were never happy to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were never happy.</v>

874
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.880
<v Speaker 2>So it was time for the divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my dad just gave her the club,</v>

875
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.020
<v Speaker 2>gave her the house and took off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he wanted to be back on the road yet.</v>

876
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:45.021
<v Speaker 2>But he's to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking pissed about it because he </v>

877
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:47.220
<v Speaker 2>never got a piece of the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never got a piece of the commentator.</v>

878
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's terrible because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that fucking started it.</v>

879
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be no comedy story.</v>

880
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>If he never had sex with my mom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elkhart Lake,</v>

881
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would never be no comedy store </v>

882
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:01.880
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep period.</v>

883
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's why my dad needs to get more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

884
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.670
<v Speaker 2>needs to get more credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

885
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.150
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never gets any credit.</v>

886
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.530
<v Speaker 2>So always or never met him.</v>

00:39:15.211 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 2>night and I heard someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does comedy.</v>

932
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

933
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 2>that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people,</v>

934
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:23.810
<v Speaker 2>they don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them on television as a host of </v>

935
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 2>a game show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of forget that he was this huge</v>

936
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 2>standards before ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did it?</v>

937
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

938
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Before he used to put a glove or was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't blow it up with his nose.</v>

939
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.700
<v Speaker 2>He would play that little kid that bobby</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

940
00:39:35.701 --> 00:39:36.360
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

941
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually did a cartoon.</v>

942
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Bobby's world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

943
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

944
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird,</v>

945
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:46.990
<v Speaker 2>like I was at the funny or die thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>last night and I was with will ferrell,</v>

946
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:49.080
<v Speaker 2>not to drop names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a huge fan of him and,</v>

947
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.700
<v Speaker 2>and he owns the site and we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

948
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 2>and he just gave it up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

949
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started at all,</v>

950
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 2>you know and see because I used to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>you on MTV and it seen Amanda.</v>

951
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.170
<v Speaker 2>This generation doesn't know what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the kits,</v>

952
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 2>the 25 and younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know that I started at MTV.</v>

953
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:05.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't know all the films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

954
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 2>They think Sandler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think the other guys,</v>

955
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know that I was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

956
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

957
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 2>at the time because MTV was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

958
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:18.340
<v Speaker 2>You were the first celebrity you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Denis Leary,</v>

959
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:23.370
<v Speaker 2>like Denis leary became a big celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 2>off mtv two and then like remote control</v>

960
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:28.530
<v Speaker 2>some movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was starting in a lot of movies </v>

961
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 2>and I always do albums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saw that seven.</v>

962
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I was in my twenties and I was having an</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome time.</v>

963
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.100
<v Speaker 2>That had to be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome,</v>

964
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much growing up like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

965
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.940
<v Speaker 2>like from the time you were as old as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could remember being a part of the </v>

966
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.531
<v Speaker 2>comedy store and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>being 20 and being famous on MTV and MTV</v>

967
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:51.970
<v Speaker 2>was gigantic and I had my own billboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was sick,</v>

968
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.820
<v Speaker 2>it was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>

969
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:59.821
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had sold out all the shows at the </v>

970
00:40:59.821 --> 00:40:59.821
<v Speaker 2>roxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

971
00:40:59.821 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I had an album and I was doing all of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>at once.</v>

972
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Was it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so much fun.</v>

973
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.460
<v Speaker 2>It was so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why now when I look back on my </v>

974
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:11.460
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get kind of sad.</v>

975
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that time of my life was my </v>

976
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Speaker 2>happiest time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it make you sad?</v>

977
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was really amazing and now </v>

978
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.451
<v Speaker 2>life is still good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like it was so well.</v>

979
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I think for a lot of people in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>

980
00:41:30.371 --> 00:41:33.890
<v Speaker 2>at least my opinion when you're in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>

981
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 2>if you fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter.</v>

982
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's in life is like one big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>

983
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of what I miss now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you get older,</v>

984
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:46.130
<v Speaker 2>like things are like your mom sick or </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or you know,</v>

985
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 2>there's all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life things,</v>

986
00:41:48.411 --> 00:41:51.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like I'm going to be 50 next year.</v>

987
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.680
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like things like when you're </v>

988
00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:56.680
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

989
00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.441
<v Speaker 2>I used to have like me and my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to go to the beach and smoke </v>

990
00:41:59.441 --> 00:41:59.441
<v Speaker 2>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

991
00:41:59.441 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 2>we used to go to the roxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to go to the rainbow.</v>

992
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:06.310
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was still do that because they don't </v>

993
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.771
<v Speaker 2>feel like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the ones that make you sad that </v>

994
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel like doing those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you feel like doing?</v>

995
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Going to the Korean bath house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching the news and chilling and </v>

996
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.470
<v Speaker 2>drinking juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just do it.</v>

997
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is that sad?</v>

998
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's sad.</v>

999
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I know I talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1000
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.850
<v Speaker 2>not the movies that watching the movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>make me sad because I missed starring in</v>

1001
00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:27.830
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>

1002
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did that dry up?</v>

1003
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's several reasons.</v>

1004
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so big and I think the bigger you </v>

1005
00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.760
<v Speaker 2>are and the fast you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the harder you fall.</v>

1006
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just like normal because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like you can only,</v>

1007
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one thing and also I think the </v>

1008
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.601
<v Speaker 2>whole weasel thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was cool for awhile and then like </v>

1009
00:42:52.601 --> 00:42:55.751
<v Speaker 2>after a while it's not cool just like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of things and I also think I didn't </v>

1010
00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 2>listen to my age and some managers they </v>
<v Speaker 2>told me not to do.</v>

1011
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the army now remember I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good movie.</v>

1012
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1013
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 2>but here's the story behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was,</v>

1014
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 2>is I had a three album deal at Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen,</v>

1015
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son in law.</v>

1016
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.770
<v Speaker 2>These big hits for me did really well </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it came time to do my third </v>

1017
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 2>movie and it was in the army now and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>managers and the agents were like,</v>

1018
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.050
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1019
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to cut all your hair off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit in the scripts.</v>

1020
00:43:24.231 --> 00:43:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1021
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.510
<v Speaker 2>And new line approached us with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other film called totally London,</v>

1022
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:34.690
<v Speaker 2>which is me being an AU pair in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was actually really </v>

1023
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.561
<v Speaker 2>funny idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jeffrey Katzenberg who used to run </v>

1024
00:43:38.561 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Disney wouldn't let me do that movie at </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Line,</v>

1025
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an AU pair in London.</v>

1026
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:46.150
<v Speaker 2>So he bought the script and shelved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did in the army now in the army now</v>

1027
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:51.190
<v Speaker 2>didn't do as good as the other films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that Disney didn't sign </v>

1028
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.020
<v Speaker 2>me up to do more movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that I did jury duty and </v>

1029
00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.650
<v Speaker 2>jury duty didn't do so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1030
00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:02.790
<v Speaker 2>So it was financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was when the movies started to draw </v>

1031
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe poor choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not listening to my agents and </v>

1032
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 2>managers and stuff at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't come at it like,</v>

1033
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.190
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came at it like I want to work,</v>

1034
00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:11.990
<v Speaker 2>I love acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love going to the set.</v>

1035
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.230
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did an Adam Sandler film,</v>

1036
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1037
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one he did the,</v>

1038
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm Sandy Wexler and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go up on the set,</v>

1039
00:44:21.471 --> 00:44:26.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Adam starring in this film and I'm </v>

1040
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:26.471
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1041
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:26.610
<v Speaker 2>And I used to star in films and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1042
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird feeling for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1043
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to be on the set and I love </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and he's an old dear friend and I'm</v>

1044
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 2>super happy for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was starring in films,</v>

1045
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere I go,</v>

1046
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't you starring in films?</v>

1047
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1048
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.650
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't answer it,</v>

1049
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor choices.</v>

1050
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:48.200
<v Speaker 2>The weasel shit dried up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1051
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movies didn't perform as well.</v>

1052
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't listen to my agents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like doing drugs.</v>

1053
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like I got all fucked up.</v>

1054
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one movie didn't do so good and the</v>

1055
00:44:58.691 --> 00:45:02.770
<v Speaker 1>next one that we didn't do so good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they eventually just stopped coming</v>

1056
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.040
<v Speaker 1>because he think about it.</v>

1057
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Biodome didn't do as good as jury duty </v>
<v Speaker 2>even know now,</v>

1058
00:45:08.841 --> 00:45:11.180
<v Speaker 2>like it's a big head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cold call from me,</v>

1059
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.880
<v Speaker 2>but at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean.</v>

1060
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:19.050
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got a sitcom on Fox and that </v>

1061
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.590
<v Speaker 2>didn't go so things were like in and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was also turning 30 and I was,</v>

1062
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.080
<v Speaker 2>my 30th birthday was very emotional for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1063
00:45:24.081 --> 00:45:29.081
<v Speaker 2>I cried a lot my 30th birthday because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going from like a boy to a man and I</v>

1064
00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:32.300
<v Speaker 2>didn't know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1065
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>

1066
00:45:33.951 --> 00:45:38.951
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't know how to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to deal in my 40th </v>

1067
00:45:38.951 --> 00:45:39.860
<v Speaker 2>birthday was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great,</v>

1068
00:45:39.861 --> 00:45:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was happy,</v>

1069
00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.560

<v Speaker 2>My 50th birthday,</v>

1070
00:45:42.561 --> 00:45:47.561
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably cry again every 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1071
00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.510
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I missed starring in films,</v>

1072
00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:51.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love acting.</v>

1074
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.130
<v Speaker 2>That's my first love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1075
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you are on fucking TV.</v>

1076
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you like acting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really know.</v>

1077
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's okay.</v>

1078
00:46:02.741 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were great on that show.</v>

1079
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I love that show.</v>

1080
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I love working with those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've done some other acting.</v>

1081
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1082
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not my thing like standup comedy to</v>

1083
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 1>me is more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then hosting you love hosting.</v>

1084
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I like doing the UFC,</v>

1085
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:23.330
<v Speaker 1>like working for the UFC and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy and doing a commentary </v>

1086
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 1>for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are fun.</v>

1087
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Doing this is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm acting.</v>

1088
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:31.821
<v Speaker 1>To me it was like long hours waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and then also a lot of actors are</v>

1089
00:46:33.001 --> 00:46:37.380
<v Speaker 1>cool but there's like 10 percent or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>

1090
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Speaker 1>They're just weird associate paths they </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about themselves,</v>

1091
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 1>their complete narcissists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have,</v>

1092
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't connect with them,</v>

1093
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of that because I </v>

1094
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:51.700
<v Speaker 1>think you're a good actor and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1095
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.240
<v Speaker 2>if he maybe developed a show or a film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1096
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:54.550
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1098
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like torture really.</v>

1099
00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that I'm like really stuck</v>

1100
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:01.510
<v Speaker 1>on a set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1101
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't enjoy it and you just </v>

1102
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.441
<v Speaker 1>don't enjoy acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that was appealing </v>

1103
00:47:08.441 --> 00:47:08.810
<v Speaker 1>about fear factor was no actors and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1104
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to act,</v>

1105
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.570
<v Speaker 1>but it could still be on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes them money.</v>

1106
00:47:11.571 --> 00:47:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

1107
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I felt like it was going to get </v>

1108
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:17.820
<v Speaker 1>canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1109
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.711
<v Speaker 1>this is just to be some horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster and then I'll go have some </v>

1110
00:47:20.711 --> 00:47:24.461
<v Speaker 1>jokes about it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll definitely get like at least 10 </v>

1111
00:47:24.461 --> 00:47:24.461
<v Speaker 1>minutes of material at this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1112
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Huge hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I ended up doing a hundred and 54 or</v>

1113
00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1114
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.610
<v Speaker 3>You can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1115
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.690
<v Speaker 3>what is it something you don't get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same residuals that you would get for a </v>

1116
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 3>sitcom though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is it called,</v>

1117
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 3>what's it called when there's over 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes?</v>

1118
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Syndication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>syndication,</v>

1119
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.350
<v Speaker 3>syndication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>syndication,</v>

1120
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>syndication.</v>

1121
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Money's not what everybody thinks it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Syndication might like news radio,</v>

1122
00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 3>one syndication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got syndication money from that,</v>

1123
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:54.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like Jerry Seinfeld </v>
<v Speaker 3>syndication money.</v>

1124
00:47:54.931 --> 00:47:58.300
<v Speaker 3>See he owns a piece of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get the real money,</v>

1125
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 3>but you get me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't complain.</v>

1126
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Peter Lang cough,</v>

1127
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.160
<v Speaker 3>he owns Hawaii if I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh well.</v>

1128
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Which is on CBS original one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he went over.</v>

1129
00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:13.280
<v Speaker 3>He went over 100 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big payday.</v>

1130
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.880
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got like a fucking $7,000,000</v>

1131
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:20.881
<v Speaker 3>house in Malibu and he is having a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>old party.</v>

1132
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine as soon as it goes over </v>
<v Speaker 3>100.</v>

1133
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 3>You just go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't go crazy.</v>

1141
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:42.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't start doing math and find </v>
<v Speaker 3>yacht.</v>

1142
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe stuff like this will bring you </v>

<v Speaker 3>back to films,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to it?</v>

1150
00:48:59.321 --> 00:49:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I guess to kick ass at a comedy special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a good way to do it,</v>

1151
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 3>to put together a really good comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>special loco if you thought about doing </v>

1152
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1245
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:51.030
<v Speaker 2>strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes I've ever seen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1248
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.880
<v Speaker 1>That happened with a lot of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that never really got mainstream </v>

1249
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.100
<v Speaker 1>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like know.</v>

1250
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember I went to see Kennison </v>
<v Speaker 1>after his hbo special and he hadn't </v>

1251
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:10.500
<v Speaker 1>quite figured out that you had to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all new material because the HBO special</v>

1252
00:53:10.751 --> 00:53:14.980
<v Speaker 1>had come out and people were yelling out</v>
<v Speaker 1>bits like while he was doing the bits,</v>

1253
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

1254
00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:20.560
<v Speaker 1>it was that transitionary period because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the guys would do hbo specials,</v>

1255
00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then where someone had did in the hour </v>

1256
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you usually would do it tonight show </v>

1257
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like seven minutes and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go perform.</v>

1258
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 1>People actually probably wanted to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>those seven minutes again.</v>

1259
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the most,</v>

1260
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:38.170
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most prolific comic that always </v>

1261
00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:38.170
<v Speaker 2>changed it up with George Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1263
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Every year he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at 14,</v>

1264

<v Speaker 1>show different show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday 8:00</v>

1273
00:54:00.351 --> 00:54:02.720
<v Speaker 1>show and a different show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday 10:00</v>

1274
00:54:02.721 --> 00:54:07.721
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the conflicts were sitting around </v>

1275
00:54:07.721 --> 00:54:07.721
<v Speaker 1>scratching their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was backstage with.</v>

1276
00:54:07.721 --> 00:54:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an opener back then.</v>

1277
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I was just starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was backstage with all these guys </v>

1278
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 1>who were like local headliners and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were just like,</v>

1279
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:14.690
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're terrible.</v>

1280
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just confronted by how good he </v>

1281
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.790
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1282
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:23.170
<v Speaker 1>he was a fucking G.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still to this day think that he's one </v>

1283
00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 1>of the most underrated comedians</v>

1284
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.220
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>

1285
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever thing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed because we had the same </v>

1286
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:30.730
<v Speaker 2>manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Rosenberg was,</v>

1287
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.080
<v Speaker 2>was my manager and Jenny's manager at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1288
00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.400
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that I noticed about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1289
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:38.900
<v Speaker 2>if I don't know if you experienced this </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him,</v>

1290
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:42.710
<v Speaker 2>is that his standup in the clubs was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking insane,</v>

1291
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.350
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason when he was on tv </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

1292
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.320
<v Speaker 2>it didn't translate as much for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

1293
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1294
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:51.080
<v Speaker 2>you know how sometimes the camera just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

1295
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:56.650
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fit for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't pick up you as funny as you </v>

1296
00:54:56.650 --> 00:55:00.671
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of my experience with him </v>

1297
00:55:00.671 --> 00:55:00.860
<v Speaker 2>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
00:55:00.861 --> 00:55:05.861
<v Speaker 2>he killed himself and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was part of the reason because he </v>

1299
00:55:05.861 --> 00:55:06.830
<v Speaker 2>was frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1300
00:55:06.831 --> 00:55:11.831
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they kill themselves if things </v>

1301
00:55:11.831 --> 00:55:11.831
<v Speaker 2>don't work out for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1302
00:55:11.831 --> 00:55:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in their career,</v>

1303
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1304
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1305
00:55:16.431 --> 00:55:16.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1306
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:19.910
<v Speaker 1>he always wanted to be Jim Carrey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his thing,</v>

1307
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:21.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to be Jim Carrey.</v>

1308
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:24.790
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be the comic that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioned from doing standup to these</v>

1309
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 1>doing these gigantic movies and he had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show for awhile and you planted the </v>

1310
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.850
<v Speaker 1>platypus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did actually did the mask with </v>

1311
00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Jim Carrey in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

1312
00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't get a lot of roles,</v>

1313
00:55:37.221 --> 00:55:42.221
<v Speaker 1>didn't get a lot of parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still maintained that a steaming </v>

1314
00:55:42.221 --> 00:55:45.491
<v Speaker 1>pile of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're listening to this and you </v>

1315
00:55:45.491 --> 00:55:45.491
<v Speaker 1>think in like when we watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get it on itunes.</v>

1316
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:48.860
<v Speaker 1>A steaming pile of me is one of my all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time favorite standup specials.</v>

1317
00:55:48.861 --> 00:55:53.861
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of it's relevant today </v>

1318
00:55:53.861 --> 00:55:57.700
<v Speaker 1>because it's 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he does this thing about the </v>

1319
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.131
<v Speaker 1>difference between people on the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people on the right and people in </v>

1320
00:56:00.131 --> 00:56:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the middle and it's fucking brilliant.</v>

1321
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to hear that and he was like a guy</v>

1322
00:56:03.711 --> 00:56:06.950
<v Speaker 1>that I saw when I was starting out where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really realized,</v>

1323
00:56:06.951 --> 00:56:11.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching him how important it is to </v>

1324
00:56:11.951 --> 00:56:15.110
<v Speaker 1>really go in depth on a subject because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just scratch the surface.</v>

1325
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was an open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you.</v>

1326
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.250
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you see about open </v>
<v Speaker 1>micros is they'll,</v>

1327
00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.250
<v Speaker 1>they'll touch a subject and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>move onto the next subject.</v>

1328
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 1>But they basically scratched the surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1329
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Jenny would dig a trench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go deep and he would like get </v>

1330
00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 1>everything there was to get out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bin.</v>

1331
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And then he would move on to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

1332
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:39.871
<v Speaker 1>And by the time he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were fucking howling and laughter </v>

1333
00:56:39.871 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 1>and holding your sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

1334
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.560
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1335
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1336
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:43.750
<v Speaker 1>he was so good.</v>

1337
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.920
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1338
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 1>He and I agree with you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see them in the clubs,</v>

1339
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 1>you really got to see what it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about.</v>

1340
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:51.130
<v Speaker 1>That's really the problem with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>specials,</v>

1341
00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:56.131
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like trying to figure out how to </v>

1342
00:56:56.131 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 1>translate what you do when it's a Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and the o are,</v>

1343
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:03.450
<v Speaker 1>how do you get someone to experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that magic of like a perfect club set </v>

1344
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a special.</v>

1345
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's people's faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's comedians faces some just </v>

1346
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 1>pop off of screen and some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my opinion.</v>

1347
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard had a weird face and he did it.</v>

1348
00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 1>He had plastic surgery and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of shit going on.</v>

1349
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1350
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I'd like clubs too in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming because I felt that connection </v>

1351
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 1>because when you do your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here in the audience is back </v>

1352
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1353
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a little disconnect if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big theater.</v>

1354
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good things about a big theater.</v>

1355
00:57:36.461 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like you hear a huge roar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see the place and everybody's</v>

1356
00:57:39.911 --> 00:57:40.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1357
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:45.750
<v Speaker 1>pauly shore must be gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at all these fucking people in the </v>

1358
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:48.631
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're at home you're on a </v>

1359
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:52.471
<v Speaker 1>couch or in front of the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very intimate so you don't feel </v>

1360
00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:55.921
<v Speaker 1>connected to this big giant place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why my comedy central special </v>

1361
00:57:55.921 --> 00:58:00.481
<v Speaker 1>from 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocky Mountain High I did in Denver at </v>

1362
00:58:00.481 --> 00:58:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the comedy works and the reason why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it there,</v>

1363
00:58:01.691 --> 00:58:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an intimate room.</v>

1364
00:58:04.031 --> 00:58:09.031
<v Speaker 1>I want to have an intimate show and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here like this is the place to do </v>

1365
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:09.031
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's nice,</v>

1366
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 1>tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you something.</v>

1367
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.620
<v Speaker 1>At what point as a stand up did you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you got really funny?</v>

1368
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you felt like,</v>

1369
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1370
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1371
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:23.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd say at the beginning it was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 10 years.</v>

1372
00:58:23.081 --> 00:58:25.630
<v Speaker 1>In probably 10 years in I felt like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was competent.</v>

1373
00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 1>That would feel like I'm better now than</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever been before,</v>

1374
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's just work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just constantly working at it.</v>

1375
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like standup is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique things that require.</v>

1376
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It requires like rigorous attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail and you have to be paying and you</v>

1377
00:58:42.551 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 1>have to be enthusiastic and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be disciplined.</v>

1378
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's almost contrary to what a lot </v>

1379
00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.791
<v Speaker 1>of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of us aren't disciplined </v>

1380
00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:56.071
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we're funding in the first </v>

1381
00:58:56.071 --> 00:58:56.071
<v Speaker 1>place because we were silly and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're impulsive.</v>

1382
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.810
<v Speaker 1>We laugh about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke around about things and think about</v>

1383
00:58:58.811 --> 00:59:01.570
<v Speaker 1>things in a fucked up way that's outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box of normal thinking,</v>

1384
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:06.810
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's a lot of times that </v>

1385
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:10.111
<v Speaker 1>sort of mindset is contrary to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset that's required to be </v>

1386
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:10.920
<v Speaker 1>disciplined to right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1387
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kid growing up,</v>

1388
00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 1>tell me about yours now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

1389
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was going to say.</v>

1390
00:59:15.731 --> 00:59:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So do you have brothers and sisters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sister,</v>

1391
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.860
<v Speaker 1>and how old is she compared to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a year younger.</v>

1392
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 1>And then your parents,</v>

1393
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 3>you grew up in the house altogether?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1394
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Like not divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1395
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were divorced.</v>

1396
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 3>My mom got divorced when I was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

1397
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was like me.</v>

1398
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

1399
00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Did you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did she have a lot of boyfriends?</v>

1400
00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:36.050
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1401
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 3>She hooked up with my Stepdad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been together ever since.</v>

1402
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 3>My mom had a lot of boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1403
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:41.450
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1404
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1405
00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:44.770
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would walk in a room,</v>

1406
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.840
<v Speaker 3>a Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan would walk into a room and </v>

1407
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 3>you'd say something where they laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thought it was funny,</v>

1408
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 3>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so no one's a funny person.</v>

1409
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Say you weren't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1410
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 3>You know how I got into college and </v>
<v Speaker 3>making people laugh when we were doing </v>

1411
00:59:59.090 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1412
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:03.910
<v Speaker 3>because we're going to fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament's so we'd all be nervous and </v>

1413
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.840
<v Speaker 3>it was like I would be the one that made</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody laugh,</v>

1414
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.150
<v Speaker 3>like when we be on a bus to go to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament.</v>

1415
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.250
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for real.</v>

1416
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 3>You talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

1417
01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I've brought it up before,</v>

1418
01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.830
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

1419
01:00:15.831 --> 01:00:20.831
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the scene of you on a bus with a </v>

1420
01:00:20.831 --> 01:00:21.890
<v Speaker 3>bunch of kids fucking shooting the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1421
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:26.891
<v Speaker 3>one of them to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to </v>

1422
01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve Graham and my other </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend Ed shorter.</v>

1423
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:29.140
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't for them.</v>

1425
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.730
<v Speaker 3>And Steve Graham is still a dear friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this day.</v>

1426
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:36.440
<v Speaker 3>So you were on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to your,</v>

1427
01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you're wrestling tournaments in Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kickboxing or talking window back</v>

1428
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:40.370
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1429
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:43.010
<v Speaker 3>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you grew up right in Boston.</v>

1430
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newton,</v>

1431
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Speaker 3>upper falls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a suburb of Boston.</v>

1432
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Is that like by Springfield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass?</v>

1433
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newton is like,</v>

1434
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right off of route nine,</v>

1435
01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:56.960
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a natick need in that area.</v>

1436
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's pretty close to Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 3>it's like not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a far drive at all.</v>

1438
01:01:00.621 --> 01:01:05.621
<v Speaker 3>And I would drive into town to train my </v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo schools in Boston and um,</v>

1439
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:10.310
<v Speaker 3>we would travel around the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd fly to places compete,</v>

1440
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a giant part of my life,</v>

1441
01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:14.910
<v Speaker 3>like karate chop shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking no tournaments.</v>

1442
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.570
<v Speaker 3>So we were always nervous because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1443
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 3>guys get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys get kicked in.</v>

1444
01:01:20.451 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 3>The face is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salary.</v>

1445
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:23.540
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started when I was 15.</v>

1446
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:25.220
<v Speaker 3>That's when I started this as in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1447
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1448
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:28.700
<v Speaker 3>So you're driving to the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:33.701
<v Speaker 3>So by the time I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was like very successful at it.</v>

1450
01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I was a four time state champion and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was competing constantly.</v>

1451
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I won the US Open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won a bunch of these,</v>

1452
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.810
<v Speaker 3>like big tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the bay state games.</v>

1453
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever go against black guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.670
<v Speaker 3>stuff I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was nervous.</v>

1455
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1456
01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Fuck right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you be the first black I fought.</v>

1457
01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:56.531
<v Speaker 3>I knocked out for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a huge alleviation of my </v>

1458
01:01:56.531 --> 01:01:59.561
<v Speaker 3>worries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume right after I won the UFC stuff</v>

1459
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.130
<v Speaker 3>and I watch you out there to like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you first were doing it,</v>

1460
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:06.380
<v Speaker 3>there was no black guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1461
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:08.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking I'm just a guy watching it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

1462
01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 3>where's the fucking black guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they would kill everyone and now</v>

1463
01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:13.550
<v Speaker 3>the son is black guys and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

1464
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:18.580
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting in boxing that </v>

1465
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:18.580
<v Speaker 3>was always the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1466
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 3>But now you're seeing Russians like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gennady Golovkin,</v>

1467
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1468
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really just a matter of the </v>

1469
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.941
<v Speaker 1>economic situation because in the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>days of the 19 hundreds,</v>

1470
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of Jews because a slapsie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maxie Rosenbaum and there was a bunch of</v>

1471
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Jewish fighters because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were Jewish immigrants and they </v>

1472
01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>faced a lot of hostility and poverty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a way out.</v>

1473
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And then it became Italians like rocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marciano,</v>

1474
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:49.641
<v Speaker 1>rocky Graziano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of Italian boxers and </v>

1475
01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>then it became like Puerto Ricans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blacks and it's mostly,</v>

1476
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of it is disenfranchised </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are looking for some sort of</v>

1477
01:02:56.430 --> 01:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>an escape from the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So financial keynotes like Kevin Durant </v>

1478
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean playing coop and like,</v>

1479
01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1480
01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's their way out.</v>

1481
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It's their ticket out of poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1482
01:03:07.681 --> 01:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>So with Russians now a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1483
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>so you're on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with your friends,</v>

1484
01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:17.091
<v Speaker 1>you're joking around and expressions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do impressions of our friends </v>

1485
01:03:17.091 --> 01:03:17.270
<v Speaker 1>having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1486
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.540
<v Speaker 1>that's different things.</v>

1487
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:23.690
<v Speaker 1>So then said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one day they said you go to </v>

1488
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.690
<v Speaker 1>connect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to comedy connection in Boston.</v>

1489
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:24.870
<v Speaker 1>My friend Steve said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1490
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really funny.</v>

1491
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1492
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I make you laugh because you're my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

1493
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people are gonna think I'm an </v>

1494
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because especially in Boston,</v>

1495
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>which was like really conservative place</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my sense of humor was very fucked up</v>

1496
01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>because these people or a fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1497
01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:46.911
<v Speaker 1>so there was all these black belts who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are competing on a national level </v>

1498
01:03:46.911 --> 01:03:50.181
<v Speaker 1>traveling all around the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were very intense people so </v>

1499
01:03:50.181 --> 01:03:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you could say fucked up things to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them laugh.</v>

1500
01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1501
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their borders there,</v>

1502
01:03:54.401 --> 01:03:59.401
<v Speaker 1>their boundaries were very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the average person because they </v>

1503
01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:02.121
<v Speaker 1>were experiencing such like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assumed cops would be a lot like that </v>

1504
01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:02.121
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even soldiers,</v>

1505
01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>cops I talked to like a lot of cops that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would train with two,</v>

1506
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 1>they had the most fucked up sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>

1507
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be seeing gunshot wounds all </v>

1508
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.470
<v Speaker 1>the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was,</v>

1509
01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of jokes they would tell like as </v>

1510
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 1>the guy was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1511
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.680
<v Speaker 1>they would be over the guy's body making</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes when no one was around.</v>

1512
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would think it's disrespectful,</v>

1513
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:27.141
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it is the human brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not supposed to experience that kind of </v>

1514
01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:31.491
<v Speaker 1>stress that a cop or soldier experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gallows humor as it were,</v>

1515
01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what a lot of them turn to for </v>

1516
01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.681
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I did is I went to an open mic </v>

1517
01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>night and I watched and one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a Richard Jeni quote,</v>

1518
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's right.</v>

1519
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>He said one of the great things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible comedians is they inspire other</v>

1520
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:50.310
<v Speaker 1>people to try it because you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1521
01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:51.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is fucking terrible.</v>

1522
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 1>We'll lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least if I suck,</v>

1523
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I won't suck that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my idea of standup is I would go to </v>

1524
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:00.750
<v Speaker 1>someplace and I would see like Robin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Williams and Richard Pryor and all these</v>

1525
01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 1>people that were just like gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

1526
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go up there and do that.</v>

1527
01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>But when I went to an open mic night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realize like,</v>

1528
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

1529
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just like being a white belt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>

1530
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:16.220
<v Speaker 1>like they're starting from the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why in this setup for </v>

1531
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>which club was ditches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stitches in Boston and</v>

1532
01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:18.700
<v Speaker 3>the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1533
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Eighty eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>August 27th,</v>

1534
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:22.630
<v Speaker 3>1988.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1535
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first one was September 25th.</v>

1536
01:05:26.171 --> 01:05:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my first time.</v>

1537
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just think back all the time.</v>

1538
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Just keeps moving on poly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not cool.</v>

1539
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.870
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never ends.</v>

1541
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to keep going when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a family now.</v>

1542
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many kids?</v>

1543
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1544
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>

1545
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:54.520
<v Speaker 3>How come here you'd have no desire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>None whatsoever.</v>

1546
01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1547
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:57.730
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1548
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.950
<v Speaker 3>But you got to find the right Gal or </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1549
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.790

<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>

1550
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.970

<v Speaker 3>In this day and age,</v>

1551
01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:09.290

<v Speaker 3>It said a transgender man gave birth to </v>

1552
01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:10.420
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

1553
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:13.960
<v Speaker 3>And then Ben Shapiro retweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woman gave birth,</v>

<v Speaker 3>getting older because at the bottom line</v>

<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should get Whitney cummings pregnant.</v>

01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:52.711
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talk to her and see if that's </v>

1568
01:06:52.711 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 3>something she'd be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine she would not be and she</v>

1569
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:55.820
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want my semen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1571
01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.940
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to talk to her to be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to decide for her or it </v>

1572
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.770
<v Speaker 3>could be Eliza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's getting married yet,</v>

1573
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.790
<v Speaker 3>but before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you want to get the.</v>

1575
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:13.510
<v Speaker 3>But why would you want to get married </v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

1576
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

1577
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's pros and cons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1578
01:07:18.491 --> 01:07:23.491
<v Speaker 3>like a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends and he travels </v>

1579
01:07:23.491 --> 01:07:25.510
<v Speaker 3>the world and he experiences a life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very.</v>

1580
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:26.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean he didn't know what already just </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1581
01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 3>We took three months off actually four </v>
<v Speaker 3>months and just vanished.</v>

1582
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Didn't talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't bring a laptop.</v>

1583
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did the Chappelle thing more than </v>

1584
01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:40.471
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to Vietnam and Cambodia and </v>

1585
01:07:40.471 --> 01:07:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand.</v>

1586
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:45.670
<v Speaker 3>We went all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did it by himself with no one and</v>

1587
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:49.210
<v Speaker 3>just met people experience things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just no one knew who he was.</v>

1588
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and a few people recognized him and </v>

1589
01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.001
<v Speaker 3>he took pictures with them and put them </v>
<v Speaker 3>on facebook and that's how we found out </v>

1590
01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:56.001
<v Speaker 3>he was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was weird,</v>

1591
01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>but he just decided like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1592
01:07:57.251 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm just willing to just have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adventure.</v>

1593
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 3>That's something obviously is out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>question when you have children,</v>

1594
01:08:02.531 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

1595
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.950
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's pros.</v>

1596
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to.</v>

1597
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:12.390
<v Speaker 3>That's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to disappear for four </v>

1598
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.390
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No kids or kids.</v>

1599
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:14.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I don't have that desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for him,</v>

1600
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desire to do an adventure,</v>

1601
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>to go someplace for a couple of weeks is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

1602
01:08:19.071 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>but when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have little girls that</v>

1603
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>wait for you and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1604
01:08:23.431 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you talked to them on the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to see you.</v>

1605
01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different world,</v>

1606
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you now?</v>

1607
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost 50 50 tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1608
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Happy Birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1609
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

1610
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Are You doing a big 50th birthday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parties are bullshit,</v>

1611
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a friend of mine's birthday </v>

1612

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1633

<v Speaker 2>it was called the Rogan's and it was you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a camper with your,</v>

1634
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:39.210
<v Speaker 2>your wife and your kids going across </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1635
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:40.930
<v Speaker 2>It was like a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost like,</v>

1636
01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like the griswolds but the </v>

1637
01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Rogan's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1638
01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:48.600
<v Speaker 2>but I know that that's something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would never do.</v>

1639
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:50.190
<v Speaker 2>But it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hilarious.</v>

1640
01:09:50.191 --> 01:09:54.720
<v Speaker 2>It was like on the travel channel and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like you guys fishing and eating and</v>

1641
01:09:54.721 --> 01:09:55.990
<v Speaker 2>just how hilarious.</v>

1642
01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of hilarious.</v>

1643
01:09:58.471 --> 01:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>But it's kind of gross to because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I see people that are,</v>

1644
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:05.980
<v Speaker 1>have their kids on these reality shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not even letting that kid </v>

1645
01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:05.980
<v Speaker 1>choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1646
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't even give that kid a choice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be famous like honey booboo or,</v>

1647
01:10:09.361 --> 01:10:14.361
<v Speaker 1>and those fucking people you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just putting your kid on tv </v>

1648
01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:15.630
<v Speaker 1>before your kid even understands the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of it.</v>

1649
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean at least when you got on </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

1650
01:10:17.341 --> 01:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you were in your twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you kind of were an adult.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it was young and I'm sure it was </v>

1652
01:10:25.671 --> 01:10:27.600
<v Speaker 1>weird to grow up in the spotlight like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1653
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.960
<v Speaker 1>But at least you were a grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see people that have their </v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you not know as a person's on tv that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be like devastating?</v>

1656

<v Speaker 1>Just if they read the comments is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to instagram or youtube and </v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:13:51.571 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 2>At least it had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one person.</v>

1735
01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1736
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1737
01:13:58.171 --> 01:14:00.300
<v Speaker 2>that was silver lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1738
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.970
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never understood silver.</v>

1739
01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Like it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no one bugs you there,</v>

1740
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 2>there no tour buses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no billboards,</v>

1741
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:11.500
<v Speaker 2>there's just no starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's none of stuff.</v>

1742
01:14:11.501 --> 01:14:12.730
<v Speaker 2>It's different than the valley.</v>

1743
01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like all like really cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>

1744
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:21.061
<v Speaker 2>Really cool bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A really nice people are very quiet,</v>

1745
01:14:21.551 --> 01:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit,</v>

1746
01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:23.770
<v Speaker 2>you can write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very creative.</v>

1747
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Speaker 2>It reminds the East village in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the vibe.</v>

1748
01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you ever go out to the east,</v>

1749
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:30.280
<v Speaker 2>so it's like low speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know bill,</v>

1750
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Bill Burr lives in Los Felis and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole area.</v>

1751
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:38.161
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that I really like about </v>

1752
01:14:38.161 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>it is the architecture there is still </v>
<v Speaker 2>old Hollywood.</v>

1753
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:44.670
<v Speaker 2>I love the old buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The building that I live in is like in </v>

1754
01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:47.521
<v Speaker 2>the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's got that history and I love </v>

1755
01:14:47.521 --> 01:14:47.521
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1756
01:14:47.521 --> 01:14:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I love that kind of that history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't like sunset now.</v>

1757
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I drive by sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like,</v>

1758
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the store and what the Roxy and the</v>

1759
01:14:55.631 --> 01:14:57.400
<v Speaker 2>rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only places left.</v>

1760
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1761
01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Isn't aware of when they like when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>chopped down the house of Blues.</v>

1762
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cool thing is the view now,</v>

1763
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.970
<v Speaker 2>the view from the stores sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:15:04.971 --> 01:15:07.300
<v Speaker 2>But what they're probably going to do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>build something bigger though.</v>

1765
01:15:07.301 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 2>They're going to go to hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to build a high rise.</v>

1766
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:12.220
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the store in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future of the store?</v>

1767
01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:13.480
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1768
01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about it.</v>

1769
01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:17.140
<v Speaker 1>It's never been doing better than it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1770
01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how packed it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's sold out every night.</v>

1771
01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:21.640
<v Speaker 1>It's constant.</v>

1772
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.940
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the building </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself?</v>

1773
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeping it or not keeping it to </v>

1774
01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else would you do?</v>

1775
01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wouldn't do it,</v>

1776
01:15:31.531 --> 01:15:36.531
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying if someone came in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and offered a whole bunch of money to </v>

1777
01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:37.620
<v Speaker 2>knock it down and build a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1778
01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you think?</v>

1779
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would suck for comedy for sure,</v>

1780
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.150
<v Speaker 1>but the laugh factory is probably not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so hot.</v>

1781
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Your probably take that motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1782
01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Take the laugh factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just moved down the street,</v>

1783
01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:51.020
<v Speaker 2>but the room's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

1784
01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:52.050
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a room.</v>

1785
01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might do something else.</v>

1786
01:15:55.110 --> 01:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is the comedy store is </v>

1787
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem had been.</v>

1788
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:02.580
<v Speaker 1>It literally is perfect for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have three different,</v>

1789
01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:04.410
<v Speaker 1>like Wednesday night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the hat trick,</v>

1790
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I started out in the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go Tuesday night.</v>

1791
01:16:07.591 --> 01:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I started on the belly room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a set in the main room and I did a</v>

1792
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:10.840
<v Speaker 1>set in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1793
01:16:10.841 --> 01:16:11.760
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
01:16:11.761 --> 01:16:14.520
<v Speaker 1>there's not a place in the country where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do that.</v>

1795
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can perform in front of 90 people,</v>

1796
01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.020
<v Speaker 1>400 people and 150 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1797

<v Speaker 1>and for me to work out my material like </v>

1800
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:34.050
<v Speaker 1>it's so invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1801
01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I like to do the Ice House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the ice house last night,</v>

1802
01:16:36.781 --> 01:16:41.781

<v Speaker 1>Andrew Santino and Tom Segura and Tom </v>

<v Speaker 1>You get to work out and fuck around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like these,</v>

1806
01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:55.710
<v Speaker 1>these clubs around here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So critical.</v>

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.000
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so important.</v>

1808
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Someone came along and bought the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

1809
01:17:00.421 --> 01:17:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be the end of a giant Arrow.</v>

1810
01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:03.840
<v Speaker 1>It would be devastating.</v>

1811
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.440
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what my mom thinks is leave </v>

<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't knock it down.</v>

1814
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would be responsible?</v>

<v Speaker 3>history of that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I took it from the Doe Haney House.</v>

1843
01:18:15.711 --> 01:18:16.500
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1844
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.010
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things in the doc </v>
<v Speaker 3>series is I'm like,</v>

1845
01:18:19.011 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 3>keep this bar because it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had one Carlos pick it up and</v>

1846
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:25.080
<v Speaker 3>we brought it over to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1847
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.290
<v Speaker 3>to Eric in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back room.</v>

1848
01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:30.320
<v Speaker 3>And we saved it for you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1849
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1850
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.030
<v Speaker 3>so the comics can have that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1851
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.730
<v Speaker 3>because that bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the door Haney house was,</v>

1852
01:18:37.731 --> 01:18:40.440
<v Speaker 3>is as iconic as the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the house that was like </v>

1854
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:45.760
<v Speaker 3>the comedy mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you.</v>

1855
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1856
01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:47.750
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Doj Haney House.</v>

1857
01:18:47.751 --> 01:18:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Which mom said I never went to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I almost bought crust hill.</v>

1858
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Chris tells for sale for years </v>

1859
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:56.200
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would've been perfect for you.</v>

1860
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:57.860
<v Speaker 3>That would have a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vibe.</v>

1861
01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.850
<v Speaker 3>It was just I lived there for a while to</v>
<v Speaker 3>living right there.</v>

1862
01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1863
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:07.570
<v Speaker 3>this is just too derelict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've always been the guy who likes </v>

1864
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:11.411
<v Speaker 3>to live away from stuff and then like </v>
<v Speaker 3>come in and then get some quiet and </v>

1865
01:19:11.411 --> 01:19:15.620
<v Speaker 3>peace or like this might be too much to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like right above the comedy store and</v>

1866
01:19:15.621 --> 01:19:18.410
<v Speaker 3>just Lord it might be look at my </v>
<v Speaker 3>burnout,</v>

1867
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying.</v>

1868
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.560
<v Speaker 3>But like that room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because that,</v>

1869
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:28.510
<v Speaker 3>that back bar is a new place but it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't feel like a new place.</v>

1870
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:33.230
<v Speaker 3>It feels like probably because of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bar and also because it's in the store.</v>

1871
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also the old video room.</v>

1872
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where my mom,</v>

1873
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.870
<v Speaker 3>it was like the comedy channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where she kept all her old video.</v>

1874
01:19:39.871 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 3>So it feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that that bar is amazing.</v>

1875
01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:43.180
<v Speaker 3>That vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1876
01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:47.830
<v Speaker 3>The coolest place you go back then ron </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on his hair around.</v>

1877
01:19:47.831 --> 01:19:50.450
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work for me Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1878
01:19:50.451 --> 01:19:51.950
<v Speaker 3>That's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

1879
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in several areas.</v>

1880
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:59.500
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1881
01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:02.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a great crew there now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so many funny comments.</v>

1882
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 3>It's really an amazing time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also like a lot of people like for,</v>

1883
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:08.580
<v Speaker 3>because I've seen the decades</v>

1884
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:13.580
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still nothing like the Kennison </v>

1885
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:13.580
<v Speaker 2>and the prior days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1886
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 2>like I watch everyone in the back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like they're killing,</v>

1887
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.390
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason it just doesn't feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I felt</v>

1888
01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:24.460
<v Speaker 1>when I was say reasons why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because back then they never been </v>

1889
01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:24.760
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1890
01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.500
<v Speaker 1>when you think about prior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before prior came around,</v>

1891
01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:29.570
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck was like prior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

1892
01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chemists in Kennison was a </v>

1893
01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:36.581
<v Speaker 1>completely unique kind of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been anybody like him </v>

1894
01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>before and so now you've seen so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>

1895
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.440
<v Speaker 1>They'll never be that uniquely innocent </v>
<v Speaker 1>time where people are like Jesus,</v>

1896
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:44.510
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1897
01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:48.620
<v Speaker 2>to respond to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prior thing when he would,</v>

1898
01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:53.650
<v Speaker 2>because I saw him for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop this show there at the store </v>

1899
01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:55.130
<v Speaker 2>when he would walk on stage and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

1900
01:20:55.131 --> 01:20:56.840
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor,</v>

1901
01:20:57.110 --> 01:21:02.110
<v Speaker 2>it was like fucking Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like people like literally like </v>

1902
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.170
<v Speaker 2>with stand up,</v>

1903
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:03.700
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1904
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>It was like that type of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Elvis.</v>

1905
01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that type of shit.</v>

1906
01:21:07.991 --> 01:21:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw that in</v>

1907
01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:12.760
<v Speaker 2>and there was something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obviously he was just so funny.</v>

1908
01:21:12.761 --> 01:21:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1909
01:21:13.991 --> 01:21:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Like even if his material wasn't funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>that night,</v>

1910
01:21:17.501 --> 01:21:18.460
<v Speaker 2>he was just funny.</v>

1911
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.640
<v Speaker 1>There is a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a real comedy genius and </v>

1912
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the most influential </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedians ever.</v>

1913
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Him and Kennison can think kinison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think obviously prior was </v>

1914
01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.080
<v Speaker 1>before my Kennison learned a lot from </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior,</v>

1915
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but Kennison was very groundbreaking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of way.</v>

1916
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Like there's never been anybody like </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1917
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also before Sam got into too </v>

1918
01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:41.190
<v Speaker 2>much of the drugs that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that five year run,</v>

1919
01:21:41.191 --> 01:21:46.191
<v Speaker 2>which was fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I was on that run to with </v>

1920
01:21:46.191 --> 01:21:49.600
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was opening for him for a while on the </v>

1921
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 2>road and then like he started getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1922
01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 2>He started going off the.</v>

1923
01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can sustain that.</v>

1924
01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1925
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:57.230
<v Speaker 1>did you ever read his brother's book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read.</v>

1926
01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't scrape book.</v>

1927
01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And his brother sort of talks about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam just kind of start stop writing </v>

1928
01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.811
<v Speaker 1>because he was partying all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this material suffered and you could </v>

1929
01:22:07.811 --> 01:22:10.310
<v Speaker 1>really feel the difference and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>could live that rock and roll crazy drug</v>

1930
01:22:10.311 --> 01:22:13.550
<v Speaker 1>life and still be an awesome creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

1931
01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Like creativity demands your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His um,</v>

1932
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got so many stories with </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting insane.</v>
