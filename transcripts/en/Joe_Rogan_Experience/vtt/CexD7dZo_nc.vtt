<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>it all started like people in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood would answer the phone like</v>

12
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.754
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cool Mexican thing to set.</v>

17
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more like the hood.</v>

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>More like the west coast Hoodie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west coast hood.</v>

19
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily central Mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blacks.</v>

20
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Like we took it from the blacks.</v>

21
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.813
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

22
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.090

<v Speaker 1>south central east La Boyle Heights.</v>

23
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Boyle Heights in the house.</v>

25
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a contentious time for fucking </v>

26
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>people when it comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans and Americans with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall thing.</v>

28
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to go,</v>

30
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.384
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the walls because they went </v>

31
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>to Mexico and I was like right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border of the gate,</v>

32
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>like the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a wall to the gate.</v>

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And across the gate they have like eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall prototypes,</v>

34
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>like the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight wall prototype.</v>

35
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one wall that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a wall was the man and it has um,</v>

36
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.513
<v Speaker 1>concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another wall that's </v>

37
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another one,</v>

38
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>it's like they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go buy title for her house.</v>

40
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they show you all the tiles.</v>

47
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Each one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it costs $25.</v>

48
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Million each wall each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anytime you have a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically.</v>

55
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Shit goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>People want to get over that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's natural.</v>

<v Speaker 1>People want to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to get out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And here's what the craziest shit about </v>

59
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:31.824
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen where it goes into </v>

60
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.603
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how are you going to stop people </v>

62
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.634
<v Speaker 1>from going around that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the silliest thing ever that is </v>

63
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:46.521
<v Speaker 1>like having this gigantic wall that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like having like a gigantic,</v>

64
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:49.314
<v Speaker 1>huge impenetrable boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on one side there's just like a </v>

65
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go right around.</v>

67
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>That may be hard to bring all your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

68
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.203
<v Speaker 2>These guys right there on the Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 2>side and those guys over there on the </v>

69
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 2>California side like that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdest shit ever.</v>

70
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Play volleyball with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they really?</v>

71
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.363
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The added another piece to that wall </v>

72
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was an old wall.</v>

73
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.413
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The construction of the wall that I saw </v>

74
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Wow Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can still swim.</v>

76
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you swim,</v>

77
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 2>you know the part of the postcards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>come get you.</v>

78
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just what,</v>

79
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>what a strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people go,</v>

80
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't want a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relax.</v>

81
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't said any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not saying that.</v>

82
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying just look at this just as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your brain.</v>

83
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.043
<v Speaker 2>Just look at this objectively and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>how bizarre it is that there's a </v>

84
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 2>gigantic physical boundary to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain people from going into a certain</v>

85
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

86
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.944
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that one day that has to </v>

87
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>not be a thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

88
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.703
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you say</v>

89
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.890
<v Speaker 2>that is a crazy thing to justify?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't come to the good spots.</v>

90
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Like the good spots are limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

91
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.603
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we let people in and there'll be no </v>

92
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more good spot.</v>

93
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.390
<v Speaker 2>It'll be just like the bad spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

94
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>

95
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ain't not uncommon.</v>

96
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 2>That's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an imperfect.</v>

97
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fear that's not totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>illogical either.</v>

98
00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:28.874
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you would be worried if you lived </v>

99
00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:35.600
<v Speaker 2>in a sweet place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a name of a city.</v>

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start moving shit and sentence.</v>

121
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 2>She would change radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to places.</v>

122
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>You get too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fucking change.</v>

123
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still strange.</v>

124
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See a wall.</v>

125
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It is to house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that I can,</v>

126
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.640

<v Speaker 2>It's fucking weird.</v>

129
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>It seems</v>

130
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>to be something that should be perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>reexamined this idea of like,</v>

131
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.303
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like we have weird parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to listen to for our whole </v>

132
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>life and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those parents with the government.</v>

133
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.973
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was a little boy I would </v>

134
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>live in Mexico and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother,</v>

135
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>she to tie me up to a stump so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll run away.</v>

136
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.223
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That glaze to follow my dad to work </v>

137
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.020
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad was like a,</v>

138
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like a steel worker or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

139
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>He worked on a lathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he worked with metal at the time.</v>

140
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will follow him to,</v>

141
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>to work everyday because I was a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid I guess,</v>

142
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.143
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will run away every day and my mom </v>

143
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>would tie me up to a little street store</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a rope.</v>

144
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I was her pet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

145
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

146
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

147
00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I lived in.</v>

148
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:56.404
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I lived in Mexico for a </v>

149
00:06:57.481 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>little while until I was three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then my dad took off.</v>

150
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Mexico at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember a bathroom was outside</v>

151
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>like an outhouse and we have to use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight to go outside and wow.</v>

152
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.613
<v Speaker 1>I remember mosquitoes everywhere and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom's family are living in like in one </v>

153
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>big ranch with different houses and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucking dusty.</v>

154
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was dusty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Mexico and they used to </v>

155
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.064
<v Speaker 1>be a truck that will water the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday because it was too dusty and </v>

156
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:33.434
<v Speaker 1>there was no cement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then my dad took off to the United </v>

157
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>States and we followed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came here.</v>

158
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>We were living in Tijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico for about two years.</v>

159
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember how you get through?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

160
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>we met with my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it through first,</v>

161
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.230
<v Speaker 1>started another family then came and got</v>
<v Speaker 1>us now.</v>

162
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was gone for a long time man.</v>

163
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went,</v>

164
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:01.084
<v Speaker 1>we were living with my aunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her name was Julia and she lived in </v>

165
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Tijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

166
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>right next to that.</v>

167
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.893
<v Speaker 1>Where that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that gate is Polonia Tsa was up </v>

168
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

169
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>we went across with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.303
<v Speaker 1>a smuggler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom pay them money and we got in his </v>

171
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:18.120
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

172
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>We crossed and we made it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember we made it through,</v>

173
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>but there was like a checkpoint back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day in San Clemente,</v>

174
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.544
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The California Sheriff Department will </v>

175
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the county sheriffs,</v>

176
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.830
<v Speaker 1>they will randomly stopped cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>like too many people in one car and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>car too heavy.</v>

178
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>So they got us and they put us in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a holding cell.</v>

179
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>My mind went one way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went the other way.</v>

180
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how old were you?</v>

181
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I was probably four maybe or five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there are three,</v>

182
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.713
<v Speaker 1>three little brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my little brother was like three </v>

183
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:54.094
<v Speaker 1>in the other one was one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they separate you from your </v>

184
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.894
<v Speaker 1>mom?</v>

185
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

186
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.663
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's how they process web </v>

187
00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:04.270
<v Speaker 1>backs are illegal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems kind of crazy.</v>

188
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>She went to one when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what I'm,</v>

189
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.093
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember crying or being scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know that we're watching </v>

190
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 1>American cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you remember.</v>

192
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And then they caught us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

193
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went back again and they cut it again</v>

194
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>in another car and we got separated </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

195
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>But this time we were held for a longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I remember my aunt,</v>

196
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>when she saw us in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

197
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they catch you guys again.</v>

198
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Just jokingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

199
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.043
<v Speaker 1>But the third time was like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my aunt and my mom came up with this </v>

200
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:41.094
<v Speaker 1>crazy idea because we have brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had cousins in Sunny California and </v>

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 1>So that were granted boyle heights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

237
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>didn't speak no English at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

238
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I picked up English right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>because your little like watching bionic</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and Shit.</v>

240

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

241
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>incredible hulk dukes of hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you basically picked it up from TV.</v>

242
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>

243
00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>what kind of lessons did you take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lessons were in English or none.</v>

244
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>

245
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>when I was in elementary school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was different from now.</v>

246
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:08.434
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like separating these kids who don't </v>

247
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 1>speak Spanish have put them in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>English as a second language class.</v>

248
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started kindergarten,</v>

249
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.230
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just picked it up?</v>

250
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I picked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teacher,</v>

251
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.000
<v Speaker 1>the teacher never spoke Spanish to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She never said I'm okay Hawaiian,</v>

252
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you know what apple is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it wasn't nothing like that.</v>

253
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:29.870
<v Speaker 1>It was time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

254
00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't got time for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pick it up or not.</v>

255
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it was because you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were so young.</v>

256
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Your brain could pick up another </v>
<v Speaker 1>language really quickly.</v>

257
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like young people,</v>

258
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 1>their brains pick up languages quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I picked it up really fast,</v>

259
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but to my pronunciation we're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

260
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know how to stay bionic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say in that kind of makes sense,</v>

261
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:52.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That a part of your brain would really </v>

262
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>develop and make it real easy to learn a</v>
<v Speaker 1>language when it's real young,</v>

263
00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:58.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

264
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I say this?</v>

265
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>What do I give more of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A desperation for figuring it out,</v>

266
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you a little kid that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from another country like you did.</v>

267
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a perfect example.</v>

268
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 1>You learned from TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

269
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.783
<v Speaker 1>So you learned from just talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are around you and </v>

270
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

271
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's saying this is how you say this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a pronoun,</v>

272
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>this is a Noun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a verb.</v>

273
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Not telling you any of that.</v>

274
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.333
<v Speaker 1>Nobody told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but later I had a cousin who lived in </v>

275
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Santa Paula and she taught me that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

276
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.300
<v Speaker 1>this is how you say this word because </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and I were playing.</v>

277
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 1>We'll play like school together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

278
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 1>or she'll give me assignments that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just should pretend to be a teacher.</v>

279
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Then a read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what man?</v>

280
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 1>For little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be fascinating.</v>

281
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.053
<v Speaker 1>Learning how to speak like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason we decide that </v>

282
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:50.970
<v Speaker 1>it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like learning a language.</v>

283
00:13:50.971 --> 00:13:51.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

284
00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 1>it's so much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to read another book.</v>

285
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

286
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 1>fuck up another book report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give you now to come on man.</v>

287
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Just get Rosetta stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

288
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>imagine trying to learn Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you saying?</v>

289
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to learn how to read it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could read that stuff and and say,</v>

290
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time would that take?</v>

291
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.560
<v Speaker 1>That would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took German in high school at for like</v>

292
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>a whole year and I did an eight class </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't learn anything.</v>

293
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.451
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

294
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I think everything gets super squirrely </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

295
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.360
<v Speaker 1>with unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like languages.</v>

296
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 1>They use things other than our letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you use things other than our</v>

297
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see Russia and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shit?</v>

300
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.493

<v Speaker 1>Like ways of using our letters pull up </v>

301
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 1>some like Russian pull up like Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>translation,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's a champ.</v>

304
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.673
<v Speaker 2>It's such a powerful language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like almost like Viking runes </v>

305
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes like Braille.</v>

306
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy looking language like um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What the hell is that man?</v>

309
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 2>That's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see in the movie Indiana Jones.</v>

310
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.040
<v Speaker 2>What is that thing that looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a spade with a knife through a tart</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

314
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Look at the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at it.</v>

315
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 2>When you see it written down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get that weird double k thing.</v>

316
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.360
<v Speaker 2>K Left K,</v>
<v Speaker 2>e Dot k cave.</v>

317
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.293
<v Speaker 2>Look at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be folks here at crown to watch </v>

<v Speaker 2>six.</v>

319
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.990

<v Speaker 2>but they're backwards.</v>

320
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Like look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

321
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:52.934
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this almost like look how they have </v>

322
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:55.994
<v Speaker 2>ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have a backwards capital are </v>

323
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.170
<v Speaker 2>what never backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowercase,</v>

324
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 2>and then it looks like that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at that,</v>

325
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you that you were the big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that does?</v>

326
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 2>You have the big Dick and these ecu with</v>
<v Speaker 2>two dicks.</v>

327
00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 2>The Chair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

328
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 2>This is a fascinating language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>RSP.</v>

329
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.523
<v Speaker 2>SSC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if we lived on another planet </v>

330
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.753
<v Speaker 2>and we were looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were observing a giant culture that </v>

331
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:26.144
<v Speaker 2>had nuclear power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they all hadn't even agreed on the </v>

332
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>same language yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be like,</v>

333
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 2>what are these crazy assholes do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>

334
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 2>They're all speaking different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can understand each other.</v>

335
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 2>They all have nuclear power and they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand each other.</v>

336
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.843
<v Speaker 2>So you're relying on translators and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to speak for you and </v>

337
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 2>representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know men.</v>

338
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched that movie.</v>

339
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.433
<v Speaker 2>Clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cultural for the first time on </v>

340
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:52.380
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa man,</v>

341
00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

342
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And you read about communication with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the community,</v>

343
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:58.280
<v Speaker 2>with the UFOS and hook thing.</v>

344
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

345
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Speaker 2>dude do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't they have like a hand thing?</v>

346
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would do with it.</v>

347
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.330
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering like what if like humans</v>

348
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 2>always think that they know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other person might be saying,</v>

349
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.173
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are the whole time you're like </v>

350
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.850
<v Speaker 2>detonating a bomb with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They add,</v>

351
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.043
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is like what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying means different things in </v>

352
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 2>different cultures too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

354

<v Speaker 3>That's what's leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Vikings back before guns,</v>

388
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.360
<v Speaker 3>it's like that just ran through </v>

<v Speaker 3>man Motherfucka and those are the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>remnants.</v>

390
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.793
<v Speaker 3>Once people started developing guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it became a fair fight and then </v>

391
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:26.401
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

392
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:28.680
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

396
00:19:39.021 --> 00:19:39.854
<v Speaker 3>if like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an actual country filled with </v>

397
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 3>people as big as those strongest men </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys and they decided to just take over.</v>

398
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.930
<v Speaker 3>There was no guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just take over.</v>

399
00:19:48.931 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrows aren't not good enough.</v>

400
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Catapults not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was him in the legs.</v>

401
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.980
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always good to have a little hyenas</v>

<v Speaker 3>everybody spoke the same language?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think if the world spoke one </v>

404
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:08.724
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things would be better or would find </v>

405
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.783
<v Speaker 3>other shit to hate each other for sooner</v>
<v Speaker 3>or later somebody will make a little </v>

406

<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

412
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.383
<v Speaker 3>Don't say this word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as people get controlling with </v>

413
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 3>the language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like let's make our own shit.</v>

455
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.490
<v Speaker 2>She says thinking how foolish that is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop you from saying that like,</v>

456
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.340
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a problem that people have.</v>

457
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:39.820

<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about standup comedy</v>

458
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're setting up a joke like that,</v>

461
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny and to pretend that it's </v>

462
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 2>not funny because it's talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain subject,</v>

463
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy because it's not about </v>
<v Speaker 2>not being able to talk about subjects.</v>

464
00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.670
<v Speaker 2>It should be like if someone has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heinous perspective,</v>

465
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:01.091
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>get raped and killed,</v>

467
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>and they start trying to make a joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

468
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Park a fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

469
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.143
<v Speaker 2>You're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you have a obviously heinous </v>

470
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a heinous perspective.</v>

471
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.093
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about a guy going to jail and </v>

472
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 2>getting worse every time it comes out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's also a reality.</v>

473
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.780
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a reality.</v>

474
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.100
<v Speaker 2>And to pay for people to deny that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people become hardened criminals because</v>

475
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 2>they'd been in the joint three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four times that joint.</v>

476
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:30.930
<v Speaker 2>What am I living in the fifties?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

478
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:36.274
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To deny that you're in there with </v>

479
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking criminals and you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in a cage,</v>

480
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 2>of course you're gonna come out worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's fucked up,</v>

481
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like nobody's getting any better at</v>

482
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:47.090
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

483
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 2>No one ever re-engineered the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison system.</v>

484
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 2>No one ever re engineered the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>people system and looks.</v>

485
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.811
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

486
00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:58.811
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just continue to have crime</v>
<v Speaker 2>emanate out of these unfortunate areas.</v>

487
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.390
<v Speaker 2>If you just fix those areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix it.</v>

488
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.253
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that you could have no </v>

489

<v Speaker 2>Is it possible?</v>

490
00:24:08.841 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Do we have enough resources?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

491
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:11.234
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do people think that in order to </v>

492
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:15.344
<v Speaker 2>live the way we live now that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere has to live in extreme </v>

493
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:20.174
<v Speaker 2>poverty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like what they think or is it </v>

494

<v Speaker 2>happen if nobody really.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It would just be middle class and poor </v>

<v Speaker 2>The rich would have to give half to the </v>

500
00:24:40.311 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>middle class in the middle cloud to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the poor Jesus.</v>

528
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 2>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

529
00:26:03.141 --> 00:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have a game,</v>

530
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.113
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating for capitalism or </v>

531
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 2>communism or socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Advocating for anything.</v>

532
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.370
<v Speaker 2>What I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

533
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.370
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to have a game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to figure out what,</v>

534
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.070
<v Speaker 2>how much of a certain thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you own that thing,</v>

535
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 2>you could do way more stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

536
00:26:23.841 --> 00:26:26.450
<v Speaker 2>You could buy a private jet to get a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

537
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.120
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>

538
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 2>what are the steps you have to take in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to get that thing?</v>

539
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.733
<v Speaker 2>And is there a too much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could someone have all of it and </v>

540
00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>everybody else has zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

541
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.603
<v Speaker 2>What if there's like there's no rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>that says you have to do something with </v>

542
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 2>it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could just</v>

543
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>collect it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn it,</v>

544
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.190
<v Speaker 1>but that'd be an asshole move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in every game there's rules.</v>

545
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:51.863
<v Speaker 1>Technically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no rule here that says Bayzos </v>

546
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.830
<v Speaker 1>couldn't just when it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure for sure.</v>

547
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

548
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is,</v>

549
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that someone could get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point where they have all the money?</v>

550
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this has happened before what jp </v>

551
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Morgan had other money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really.</v>

552
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that,</v>

553
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 1>that Dr Ritu the men who built America </v>
<v Speaker 1>at one time he held,</v>

554
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.540
<v Speaker 1>he held a monopoly and all the steel in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

555
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that people really resist is </v>

556
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 1>if you try to make new money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 1>that's why people are like really edgy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about bitcoin.</v>

558
00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on?</v>

559
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Speaker 1>This is their own real money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're buying houses with bitcoin.</v>

560
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.460
<v Speaker 1>People are selling houses with bitcoin.</v>

561
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a bitcoin.</v>

562
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.473
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this day and age with the kind of </v>

563
00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:45.714
<v Speaker 1>trust that people have in government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>government decisions when it comes to </v>

564
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bit point stuff,</v>

565
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.913
<v Speaker 1>any crypto currency stuff becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more interesting to people because </v>

566
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:56.814
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy fuckers aren't fixing </v>

567
00:27:57.841 --> 00:27:58.674
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

568
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:59.703
<v Speaker 1>Well now when I was living in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a Pico Aliso people </v>

569
00:28:03.501 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 1>gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least we'll build housing projects.</v>

570
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 1>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

571
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.843
<v Speaker 1>we let our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom didn't have money in a bank for </v>

572
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.870
<v Speaker 1>at first our neighborhood and have money</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bank.</v>

573
00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 1>So they started their own little bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we had this thing called a,</v>

574
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say it in English </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Dina.</v>

575
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.503
<v Speaker 1>We get like I guess 10 families that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and every week somebody puts $100 </v>

576
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.680
<v Speaker 1>in the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's 10 of us and everybody puts a</v>

577
00:28:30.681 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 1>$100 and we all take turns every week </v>
<v Speaker 1>collecting the pot.</v>

578
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 1>So you and I in him and seven other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were putting in $100.</v>

579
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:39.204
<v Speaker 1>That's a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that way this week Joe Rogan gets it </v>

580
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and next week everybody puts it $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

581
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 1>And this time he takes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets 100,000</v>

582
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:48.294
<v Speaker 1>dollars and then the next week I get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars to everybody makes a </v>

583
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be like the way we used to</v>

584
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:56.760
<v Speaker 1>learn each other out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money in the hood.</v>

585
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 1>It works hard on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the honor system,</v>

586
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 1>but it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never works out.</v>

587
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It always failed because usually like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy really what do they want to pay?</v>

588
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.363
<v Speaker 1>Something will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it'll look bad on his family in </v>

589
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:11.094
<v Speaker 1>Mexico or we'll go hunt that food down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I used to do that with what I used </v>

590
00:29:16.051 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>to be the guy that used to collect all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money from these people when I was a</v>

591
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:20.160
<v Speaker 1>little boy.</v>

592
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 years old.</v>

593
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.513
<v Speaker 1>Walking in the neighborhood was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars in cash and passing it </v>

594
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:28.140
<v Speaker 1>to this house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one knew that.</v>

595
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:28.974
<v Speaker 1>But there's this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how money marketing worked in </v>

596
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:32.484
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood while everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowing for somebody could no weapon </v>

597
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.310
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand dollars.</v>

598
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Right to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting man.</v>

599
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really cool way to handle it.</v>

600
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.133
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like our social game that everybody's </v>

601
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:49.510
<v Speaker 1>playing with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool way to do it.</v>

602
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

603
00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm in commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could do it if they got together.</v>

604
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't pay a rate.</v>

605
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 10 people put $100 each,</v>

606
00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

607
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just pass it around.</v>

608
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

609
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.993
<v Speaker 1>That's something that's a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>security that you'd be happy to </v>

610
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 1>contribute to get a group of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and do that.</v>

611
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.403
<v Speaker 1>That's super smart because then you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>these little bursts of a big chunk of </v>

612
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:18.394
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

613
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

614
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a social thing too,</v>

615
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:23.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who came up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a social thing.</v>

617
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:28.883
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that keeps people </v>

618
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:31.264
<v Speaker 1>communicating with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about shit and getting excited </v>

619
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:36.220
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad ass man.</v>

620
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 1>He was a hustler man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom sewed.</v>

621
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.303
<v Speaker 1>We used to go to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I live in boyle heights and </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

625
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:50.704
<v Speaker 1>like where everything was.</v>

<v Speaker 1>plastic.</v>

629
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 1>We have to take it out of the trash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in hefty bags.</v>

630
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.343

<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why they chose him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

661
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You can't figure it out motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have like a little girl.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's the,</v>

664
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.550
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was destined maybe.</v>

665
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

666
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>

667
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but there is a possibility that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.693
<v Speaker 1>people are malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of steer them in different </v>

669
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:15.710
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

670
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 1>are those ways good or bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

671
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.333
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's happy and he's gay and they </v>

672
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.780
<v Speaker 1>became gay because he dressed him up as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little girl.</v>

673
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 1>If you really truly care about gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

674
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 1>does that bother you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird question,</v>

675
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

676
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

677
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:30.880
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

678
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I could you firmly believe in equality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

679
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:34.994
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sexual orientation if you firmly </v>

680
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:38.984
<v Speaker 1>believe in total equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should have no issue with someone </v>

681
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:45.440
<v Speaker 1>turning a little boy gay mean really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>

682
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.760
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

684
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:47.774
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people to decide their own </v>

685
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:50.384
<v Speaker 1>destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one decides their own destiny </v>

686
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 1>religiously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

687
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Little kids get introduced into </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

688
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.280
<v Speaker 1>but sexually it's work at super </v>
<v Speaker 1>important for us.</v>

689
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.080

867
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Like the coaches were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courteous all over the house.</v>

868
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:12.344
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't see the sun come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more so lit perfectly like the house </v>

869
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 1>look like at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM all day.</v>

870
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.613
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all over the house there was drugs </v>

871
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:23.324
<v Speaker 1>but there were not openly out there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody to take only like four people </v>

872
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 1>who knew what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had liquid coke.</v>

873
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:32.300
<v Speaker 1>They're like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the nasal sprays?</v>

874
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had like those filled with water and </v>

875
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:36.494
<v Speaker 1>coke because they can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do coke sometimes the coke is </v>

876
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:40.184
<v Speaker 1>stuck in your knees and your nose so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pour a little water to </v>

877
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.910
<v Speaker 1>help it go down.</v>

878
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy had little squeeze Varvatos</v>

879
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 1>all over the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nasal sprays,</v>

880
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.433
<v Speaker 1>Haley's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I will see people lean over in the </v>

881
00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 1>back of the house and then grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

882
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And so then I found out where it was and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

883
00:42:57.951 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 1>instead of just putting it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just walked it with.</v>

884
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:04.811
<v Speaker 1>I kept it God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I stood at that House to 1130 in</v>

885
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 1>the morning and I got there at two in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>

886
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.870
<v Speaker 1>But this is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who owned the house,</v>

887
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.640
<v Speaker 1>he had nobody cleaning the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody like it.</v>

888
00:43:15.641 --> 00:43:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if you grab a little bit from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

889
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.913
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if Joe Rogan picked up those beer </v>

890
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.870
<v Speaker 1>through return trashcan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll give you points.</v>

891
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Doug,</v>

892
00:43:25.171 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 1>he points his name was doug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan got three points.</v>

893
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.153
<v Speaker 1>So if you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this house you got invited to his </v>

894
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike by text because Doug knows you,</v>

895
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.140
<v Speaker 1>but he knows you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else invite to you,</v>

896
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 1>but now that you got points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know enough points,</v>

897
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you get a personal call.</v>

898
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

899
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:47.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Lynn,</v>

900
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Marilyn Manson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't Marilyn Manson just looked</v>

901
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:57.010
<v Speaker 1>like he was just hired for the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess for the Party to.</v>

902
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I hate to bring up this thing with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother again though.</v>

903
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is.</v>

904
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it is possible really that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone dresses their kid up,</v>

905
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:07.663
<v Speaker 1>all jokes aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that possible that if you dress your </v>

906
00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 1>kid up as a girl for like a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and coach them into acting like a girl,</v>

907
00:44:15.051 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that it turns them gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't honestly.</v>

908
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:19.334
<v Speaker 1>All jokes aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think it works like this </v>

909
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.600
<v Speaker 1>stop right when they got here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or did he keep playing that way?</v>

910
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he,</v>

911
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:25.731
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

912
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:26.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped.</v>

913
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.253
<v Speaker 1>He was like a male afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could have been a total </v>

914
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think was probably coincidence.</v>

915
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.290
<v Speaker 2>It just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

916
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:35.543
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to think that people that </v>

917
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 2>susceptible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they definitely are in some ways,</v>

918
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.730
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not sexually because that seems to</v>

919
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 2>be like a biological thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of like behavior,</v>

920
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.490
<v Speaker 2>like racism for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

921
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Racism carries from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from parent to child pretty pretty well,</v>

922
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have a good relationship with </v>

923
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 2>their parents and their parents are </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

924
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.460
<v Speaker 2>that shit will carry in because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are racist,</v>

925
00:44:58.461 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 2>they still love their kids so they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at their kids,</v>

926
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 2>but they're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the kids associate really good,</v>

927
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:05.574
<v Speaker 2>like love with family also with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>distrust of certain certain groups and </v>

928
00:45:11.191 --> 00:45:12.024
<v Speaker 2>colors and that's a almost a thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're taught by the people that care </v>

929
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 2>about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wild animals.</v>

930
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're taught well,</v>

931
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.880
<v Speaker 2>wild animal behavior by their parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the same shit with people.</v>

932
00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

933
00:45:26.741 --> 00:45:29.250
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing that human beings are</v>

934
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 2>malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

935
00:45:30.601 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get them to behave a certain way</v>

936
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:34.584
<v Speaker 2>in Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then a different way in Brazil or a </v>

937
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 2>certain way in Japan and a different way</v>
<v Speaker 2>in China.</v>

938
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

939
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.573
<v Speaker 2>I was in China recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's crazy is when </v>

940
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you're around large groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just walk in front of you,</v>

941
00:45:46.801 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just walked through you.</v>

942
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 2>They walked through little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they walked through everybody.</v>

943
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:52.554
<v Speaker 2>And it's not rude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just they have a different way of </v>

944
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 2>moving around because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and so many spots in China,</v>

945
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 2>they're not being rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't consider it rude.</v>

946
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.213
<v Speaker 2>It's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to get there and </v>

947
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 2>they don't mind everybody bumps into </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other a little bit.</v>

948
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

949
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you touched me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

950
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:08.903
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy touched me with his hand </v>

951
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.340
<v Speaker 2>doesn't buy into their fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 2>butting each other,</v>

952
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're not doing it mean they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of going through each other.</v>

953
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't mind touching each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're just,</v>

954
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see an opening,</v>

955
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:22.930
<v Speaker 2>they're going in that opening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

956
00:46:22.931 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't look it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't own the space in front of you,</v>

957
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:26.520
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little spot.</v>

958
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

959
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 2>And they don't think it's bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it here to Chinese people do.</v>

960
00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian people know Armenian people.</v>

961
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Older people were trying to catch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bus.</v>

962
00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.420
<v Speaker 2>We were all trying to cut in a bus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they run.</v>

963
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 2>They rush in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't say,</v>

964
00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:42.510
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I know how to say,</v>

965
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:44.690
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Armenian mixing.</v>

966
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.863
<v Speaker 2>You know when people don't mind being </v>
<v Speaker 2>jammed up like that in the winter in </v>

967
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Boston when they get on the team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those trains,</v>

968
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:55.343
<v Speaker 2>like if you leave in fenway park and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like fucking zero degrees outside </v>

969
00:46:59.161 --> 00:46:59.994
<v Speaker 2>in the winter and you get on the tea </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and especially if it's sunny </v>

970
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:03.594
<v Speaker 2>out so nobody feels creepy about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they shut those doors and everybody is </v>

971
00:47:06.141 --> 00:47:09.070
<v Speaker 2>just jammed in there huddled together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

972
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:10.021
<v Speaker 2>Penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

973
00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't mind your fucking freezing.</v>

974
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.760
<v Speaker 2>So everybody has more of a sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a big problem with La.</v>

975
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:18.893
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy to just live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy to like physically </v>

976
00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:23.050
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too hot.</v>

977
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 2>The hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heat's one thing,</v>

978
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:26.880
<v Speaker 2>but you could get by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get used to that.</v>

979
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't get used to the cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do it.</v>

980
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 2>You can't stay out there.</v>

981
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.990
<v Speaker 2>You could stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the heat's way easier.</v>

982
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 2>You could stay out there if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shade and you have some water and live.</v>

983
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:43.630
<v Speaker 2>You literally can't live in Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

984
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

985
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't go to sleep there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to sleep there,</v>

986
00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you'll die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't make it.</v>

987
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 2>It's zero degrees out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to make it.</v>

988
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

989
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't just sleep on the ground when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 30 below zero,</v>

990
00:47:56.231 --> 00:47:59.540
<v Speaker 2>like in Alaska or some shit here in </v>
<v Speaker 2>panhandle and that code.</v>

991
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:00.783
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're going to be a hardy </v>

992
00:48:01.931 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker to survive those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy to survive la.</v>

993
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.990
<v Speaker 2>We don't have enough interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

994
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:10.003
<v Speaker 2>We've got a distorted sense of where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting in this whole thing in </v>

995
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to Griffith Park.</v>

996
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even have bugs,</v>

997
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in Thailand,</v>

998
00:48:16.481 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 2>they got crazy bugs.</v>

999
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Do bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bite the fuck out of here.</v>

1000
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:24.520

<v Speaker 2>You and mosquitoes are ferocious.</v>

1001
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Those are real bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1002
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.480
<v Speaker 2>We got here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roaches.</v>

1003
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.030
<v Speaker 2>We got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a few roaches.</v>

1004
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 2>We barely have any flies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ain't got shit.</v>

1005
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 2>No bugs want a part of this crazy dry </v>
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>

1006
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're super lucky,</v>

1007
00:48:39.011 --> 00:48:39.844
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bugs don't like dry air bugs like the </v>

1008
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 2>crawley ones don't seem to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fly,</v>

1009
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:46.264
<v Speaker 2>once they fucking hate dryer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of hummingbirds eaten them up to </v>

1010
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>

1011
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.823
<v Speaker 2>There's not lots of hummingbirds </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else I've lived like there is </v>

1012
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We rehabbed a honeybee,</v>

1013
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.800
<v Speaker 2>a hummingbird in my house and released </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1014
00:48:56.801 --> 00:49:01.801
<v Speaker 2>We found a girls found a hummingbird </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was wounded and the,</v>

1015
00:49:01.811 --> 00:49:02.644
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nursed it back to health and then </v>

1016
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:04.534
<v Speaker 2>rereleased it in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a little hummingbird feeders in </v>

1017
00:49:06.551 --> 00:49:07.384
<v Speaker 2>the backyard.</v>

1018
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.823
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hummingbirds,</v>

1019
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the coolest little animals ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so weird.</v>

1020
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll put up a video of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this hummingbird.</v>

1021
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:14.643
<v Speaker 2>It's so cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they fed it sugar water life super </v>

1022
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 2>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1023
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they fly so fast that you can't,</v>

1024
00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.890
<v Speaker 2>like if you see it with a stop motion or</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow motion photography,</v>

1025
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 2>slow motion videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't believe how fast it is.</v>

1026
00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1027
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.870
<v Speaker 2>you're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1028
00:49:31.871 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

1029
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:33.423
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of animal evolved like </v>

1030
00:49:35.621 --> 00:49:39.850
<v Speaker 2>that little tiny wings and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking billion miles an hour.</v>

1031
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Like look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that thing in slow Mo.</v>

1032
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there'S no animal like that.</v>

1033
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 2>But imagine if an eagle did that.</v>

1034
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.793
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you how fucked everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be if an eagle could move like a </v>

1035
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:55.834
<v Speaker 2>hummingbird or just a giant fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant flying thing with knives for </v>

1036
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:07.021
<v Speaker 2>fingers and it's just snatch and fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of water and it's as big as a Turkey</v>

1037
00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 2>and it moves like a hummingbird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1038
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think about that's what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiger is,</v>

1039
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:17.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tiger is a big thing that moves sanely</v>

1040
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.240
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1041
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:21.700
<v Speaker 2>a little of those wings are too narrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and never within their wings to it.</v>

1042
00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do those wines are so small that if they</v>

1043
00:50:23.681 --> 00:50:24.514
<v Speaker 2>were in a superhero,</v>

1047
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Dynamically glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But they're so adorable.</v>

1057
00:51:00.651 --> 00:51:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Tucked into the backseat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiny.</v>

1058
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so Beautiful.</v>

1059
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Such an unusual little bird to who eats </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1060
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:10.243
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure everything that can snack </v>

1061
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.150
<v Speaker 3>dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think good luck catching them.</v>

1062
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Good luck catching that little fucker.</v>

1063
00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.150
<v Speaker 5>I told you I was listening at leonardo </v>
<v Speaker 5>book the other day and uh,</v>

1064
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:20.223
<v Speaker 5>one of the weird things in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 5>it mentions is that he had a very weird </v>

1065
00:51:22.421 --> 00:51:24.970
<v Speaker 5>fascination or it was written in one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his notebooks that he wanted to,</v>

1066
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:29.710
<v Speaker 5>I think it was he wanted to describe the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tongue of a woodpecker would.</v>

1067
00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.713
<v Speaker 5>This is like an obviously the 14 </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds where you'd have to catch the </v>

1068
00:51:33.911 --> 00:51:35.260
<v Speaker 5>woodpecker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill it,</v>

1069
00:51:35.261 --> 00:51:37.600
<v Speaker 5>dissect it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then did the description of yourself</v>

1070
00:51:37.601 --> 00:51:39.250
<v Speaker 5>and I guess he does have descriptions of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1071
00:51:39.251 --> 00:51:44.251
<v Speaker 5>which at that time are so descriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would have to be a scIentist.</v>

1072
00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 5>Like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>

1073
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:46.550
<v Speaker 5>really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1074
00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.600
<v Speaker 5>You would catch a woodpecker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you catch one of those fuckers?</v>

1075
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.660
<v Speaker 5>Know why you would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how you thought of that was making them.</v>

1076
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he just shot it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky?</v>

1077
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Came up with the trapper of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet,</v>

1078
00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.683
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1079
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine those dudes that were just like </v>

1080
00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.253
<v Speaker 3>initially studying species's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like imagine just like writing down </v>

1081
00:52:08.581 --> 00:52:11.970
<v Speaker 3>drawing pictures of a cat that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in the fucking jungle.</v>

1082
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.093
<v Speaker 3>Like being one of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>started the first people to document </v>

1083
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.740
<v Speaker 3>what animals exist out there because </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how long have we known?</v>

1084
00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.370
<v Speaker 3>How long have you had a good sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what animals exist out there?</v>

<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1087
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.210
<v Speaker 3>Like right now we know about giant bears</v>
<v Speaker 3>that live in Russia,</v>

1088
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know about komodo dragons,</v>

1089
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 3>we know about nile crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know about science,</v>

1090
00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:40.763
<v Speaker 3>we know about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know about all these animals that </v>

1091
00:52:41.821 --> 00:52:45.420
<v Speaker 3>exist because we've got all the videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the information,</v>

1092
00:52:45.421 --> 00:52:46.890

1093
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.490
<v Speaker 3>How long have people known what was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different spots?</v>

1094
00:52:50.491 --> 00:52:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Has it been 2000 years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has it been three?</v>

1095
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many thousand years has it been like</v>

1096
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:58.830
<v Speaker 3>reliable information?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No crackings,</v>

1097

<v Speaker 3>like what did you really sick?</v>

1099
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.273
<v Speaker 3>Like how long has it been where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a detailed account of what animals </v>

1100
00:53:08.611 --> 00:53:10.200
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one of the things he used.</v>

1101
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the as they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparent or the hollow,</v>

1102
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:17.150
<v Speaker 3>there've been a pen or something to ride</v>
<v Speaker 3>on hold the first and they have a road.</v>

1103
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't writing I think was like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle east.</v>

1104
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I think it was all like sumir and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>places think that's where they think</v>

1105
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see that writing man,</v>

1106
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.240
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1107
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's called cuneiform.</v>

1108
00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.273
<v Speaker 2>It's like it looks like nails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like they're like old school </v>

1109
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:37.344
<v Speaker 2>lead carpenter nails and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>left and right and up and down the </v>

1110
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 2>alphabet to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1111
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

1112
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm,</v>

1113
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I'm not an expert,</v>

1114
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 2>but I think they believed this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oldest written language.</v>

1115
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:51.653
<v Speaker 2>See if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is cuneiform the oldest written </v>

1116
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 2>language?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that was where it started.</v>

1117
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.780
<v Speaker 2>That it started with these little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1118
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>like they look like nails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that shit dude.</v>

1119
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.383
<v Speaker 2>It's such a fantastic looking language </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it almost looks like some crazy </v>

1120
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:11.484
<v Speaker 2>computer coders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how all this kind of </v>

1121
00:54:13.381 --> 00:54:14.214
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in who's board in prison will </v>

1122
00:54:16.441 --> 00:54:17.274
<v Speaker 2>pick it up and learn how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let this with another inmate and give </v>

1123
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.300
<v Speaker 2>each other messages for the guards.</v>

1124
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what it says this.</v>

1125
00:54:22.501 --> 00:54:23.610
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the one,</v>

1126
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:24.444
<v Speaker 2>it's called a mil to mil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the oldest language comes from Sri </v>

1127
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.103
<v Speaker 2>Lanka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore and to indian states to mill </v>

1128
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:33.894
<v Speaker 2>is still spoken by approximately 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people across the world to is </v>

1129
00:54:37.681 --> 00:54:38.514
<v Speaker 2>one of the oldest literary canons of any</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and the world with the </v>

1130
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.923
<v Speaker 2>earliest piece of tamil writing sand </v>
<v Speaker 2>graham literature dating to </v>

1131
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:51.351
<v Speaker 2>approximately 300 bce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's 300 years before current era.</v>

1132
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not super old.</v>

1133
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the thing language,</v>

1134
00:54:56.191 --> 00:55:01.191
<v Speaker 2>I think sumerian is susie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says sumerian first developed 3,200</v>

1135
00:55:02.011 --> 00:55:02.970
<v Speaker 2>bc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1136
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.013
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're saying what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oldest language and is active in the </v>

1137
00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:09.450
<v Speaker 2>world and that's two mill and that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from 300 bc.</v>

1138
00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:11.880
<v Speaker 2>But the sumerian language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1139
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Is the oldest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we saw.</v>

1140
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:14.844
<v Speaker 2>That's cuneiform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was created using a read stylist </v>

1141
00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:20.970
<v Speaker 2>to make wedge shaped indentations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>clay tablets.</v>

1142
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 2>So they think as far as they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the oldest shit.</v>

1143
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:25.770
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1144
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:31.150
<v Speaker 2>that's only 5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 something years to develop the,</v>

1145
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:35.580
<v Speaker 2>to record transactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep track of money or to talk,</v>

1146
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:36.723
<v Speaker 2>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was more important to them at the </v>

1147
00:55:37.591 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 2>time transaction would be the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably everything.</v>

1148
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Writing things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to figure out what,</v>

1149
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 2>what animal did not eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1150
00:55:46.321 --> 00:55:48.330
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out what makes people </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

1151
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Keep track of who paid taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it.</v>

1152
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 2>So 3,200</v>
<v Speaker 2>bc,</v>

1153
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 5,218</v>

1154
00:55:55.381 --> 00:55:57.180
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1155
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.820
<v Speaker 2>That seems so recent that I love that </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1156
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Five thousand years ago they figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to write shit down.</v>

1157
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they do before then?</v>

1158
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1159
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.073
<v Speaker 2>And we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had raised the more I barely </v>

1160
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:16.141
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1161
00:56:16.141 --> 00:56:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I suck at teaching them what I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I write,</v>

1162
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My handwriting deteriorates rapidly with</v>

1163
00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 2>every</v>

1164

<v Speaker 3>should do that as in high school when I </v>

1168

<v Speaker 3>was bored at the superman logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 3>I used to do all the band names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like band logos.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1171
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:44.494
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did a day when we're talking about </v>

1172
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:45.904
<v Speaker 3>George Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a fact and I was trying to bring </v>

1173
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:48.784
<v Speaker 3>it up in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had to go back and find it and I </v>

1174
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:51.890
<v Speaker 3>just remembered it because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1175
00:56:51.891 --> 00:56:52.724
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know when the first dinosaur </v>

1176
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 3>bones were discovered?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1177
00:56:57.071 --> 00:57:02.071
<v Speaker 3>we talked about this once a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was more recent</v>

1178
00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:03.274
<v Speaker 3>than something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he was already </v>

1179
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done with all of that.</v>

1180
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.023
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that they had written and </v>

1181
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:10.160
<v Speaker 3>talked about.</v>

1182
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Everything we'd go back and discuss was </v>
<v Speaker 3>all before they even knew like dinosaurs</v>

1183
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 3>even existed almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly crazy.</v>

1185
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is really crazy.</v>

1186
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We mean imagine you have like,</v>

1187
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:24.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think we got an understanding of what</v>

1188
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.930
<v Speaker 3>is here and what's been here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably been similar to what he,</v>

1189
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.493
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they find a bone that's as big as a </v>

1190
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:33.290
<v Speaker 3>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1191
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>

1192
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:37.960
<v Speaker 3>That's what it would have freaked me </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1193
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you imagined you find a bone as big as a</v>

1194
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 3>bus and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

1195
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 3>this is one animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

1196
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.410
<v Speaker 3>This is a leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1197
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.133
<v Speaker 3>He keeps getting bigger and bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces and then you realize you have a </v>

1198
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:56.380
<v Speaker 3>brontosaurus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine finding all that shit,</v>

1199
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.393
<v Speaker 3>not knowing it exists and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this thing that looks </v>

1200
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:04.280
<v Speaker 3>like a rib and what is this thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that noise,</v>

1201
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 3>how big the world is.</v>

1202
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:06.363
<v Speaker 3>So you'd think of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another one around the world </v>

1203
00:58:07.251 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 3>that they live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he'd already made a gang of money,</v>

1213
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:36.304
<v Speaker 3>like gambling and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he decides to go down to the Congo </v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1215
00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:46.750

<v Speaker 3>because these people,</v>

1216
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.793

<v Speaker 3>dragon.</v>

1227

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1235
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.483
<v Speaker 3>he went to the jungle wet looking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>these supposedly bronto sources that </v>

1236
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:37.090
<v Speaker 3>people see in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>

1237
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.020

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1241
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 3>What would it hide?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would hide in the jungle.</v>

1242
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:55.640
<v Speaker 3>He would have a dam or a cave in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

1243
00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.670

<v Speaker 3>where people never go for a big thing to</v>

1244
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:03.770

<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll copy shit from the enemy to like</v>

1386
01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 2>enemies doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll day,</v>

1387
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fucking do it was a bit of birth.</v>

1388
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1389
01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 2>he did the worst shit of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>

1390
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.353
<v Speaker 2>Give her a listen to that dan carlin </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore history series to after the </v>

1391
01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:44.620
<v Speaker 2>show I'm going to send to you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to it.</v>

1392
01:06:44.621 --> 01:06:45.454
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts if you've got the time because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like five parts and you get sucked </v>

1393
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.463
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just shows you how insane that </v>

1394
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 2>guy and his family were and what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire that he created.</v>

1395
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.443
<v Speaker 2>This one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his real name is too much and they had </v>

1396
01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:04.290
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had catapults,</v>

1397
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 2>light human bodies on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>

1398
01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:10.360
<v Speaker 2>They will do a quick as shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>airwatch horseback.</v>

1399
01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what saved them.</v>

1400
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of their strategies,</v>

1401
01:07:13.871 --> 01:07:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but they were extremely stout people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were very,</v>

1402
01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 2>very strong people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

1403
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.450
<v Speaker 2>All I know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just full disclosure.</v>

1404
01:07:22.451 --> 01:07:23.284
<v Speaker 2>All I know about is what I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>dan carlin's hardcore history podcast </v>

1405
01:07:25.781 --> 01:07:26.614
<v Speaker 2>and like a couple of articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never really read that much about </v>

1406
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:32.560
<v Speaker 2>the mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he said was that they had these</v>

1407
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:35.920
<v Speaker 2>bows that required 160 pounds to pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

1408
01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:36.754
<v Speaker 2>which is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they must be shooting heavier arrows </v>

1409
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Speaker 2>that could kill people better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1410
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:44.314
<v Speaker 2>The smaller people or the weaker people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would would possess and they were a </v>

1411
01:07:47.951 --> 01:07:50.630
<v Speaker 2>nomadic horse people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were traveling around,</v>

1412
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>living in tents like they despise people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that live in cities.</v>

1413
01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.693
<v Speaker 2>They were just the strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most ruthless army the world has ever </v>

1414
01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 2>seen at the time like nobody had ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen anything like this.</v>

1415
01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>They would just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed millions of people.</v>

1416
01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 2>They thInk New York times had an article</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said they killed so many people.</v>

1417
01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:09.370
<v Speaker 2>They change the carbon footprint of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1418
01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 2>There was less people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a noticeable number.</v>

1419
01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:13.504
<v Speaker 2>If you go and you look through the ice </v>
<v Speaker 2>core samples and they are starting to </v>

1420
01:08:16.311 --> 01:08:17.144
<v Speaker 2>attributed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some people at least are attributing </v>

1421
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:19.184
<v Speaker 2>that to gingiss con killing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 </v>

1422
01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:24.920
<v Speaker 2>percent of the population on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one out of 10,</v>

1423
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>he killed more people than aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1424
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:28.394
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1425
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 2>How many people didn't get killed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had to guess,</v>

1426
01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>someone was just talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and say,</v>

1427
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:37.340
<v Speaker 2>no one should die from hiv anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one should die of aids.</v>

1428
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 2>It literally shouldn't have to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

1429
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.980
<v Speaker 2>and that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This take medication.</v>

1430
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were kids,</v>

1431
01:08:45.081 --> 01:08:45.914
<v Speaker 2>everybody was terrified to aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aids was a death sentence while eating </v>

1432
01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:51.590
<v Speaker 2>twinkies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified of aids while eating the thing</v>

1433
01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 2>that's slowly killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrified to get into aids.</v>

1434
01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:55.623
<v Speaker 2>A little kid gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody will want to go to school no </v>

1435
01:08:57.231 --> 01:09:00.200
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that one kid go to school?</v>

1436
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magic god in there,</v>

1437
01:09:02.281 --> 01:09:03.114
<v Speaker 2>but they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1438
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got it.</v>

1439
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I remember being in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in my car.</v>

1440
01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I was living in revere Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rear.</v>

1441
01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:13.143
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment complex and I was driving my </v>

1443
01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:17.924
<v Speaker 2>car and I was on the high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the road listening to the </v>

1444
01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:21.591
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1445
01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see where the traffic lights are.</v>

1446
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:24.703
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

1447
01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you remember it's like burned in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

1448
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:27.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1449
01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:29.630

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 2>What in my car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

1451
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:33.403
<v Speaker 2>what's out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like it was a scene </v>

1452
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:38.630
<v Speaker 2>in a vampire movie monster movie or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like a zombie outbreak.</v>

1453
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1454
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.820
<v Speaker 2>now it's reached one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball players of all time.</v>

1455
01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:44.654
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are people going to just start dropping </v>

1456
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.040
<v Speaker 2>off like flies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to start,</v>

1457
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:50.323
<v Speaker 2>please just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't condoms right away </v>

1458
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1459
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.130
<v Speaker 2>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 2>animals bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Savage,</v>

1461
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:00.953
<v Speaker 2>savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a reason why there's 7 </v>

1462
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.103
<v Speaker 2>billion of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We stop.</v>

1463
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 2>People need to stop pretending that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fully,</v>

1464
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.330
<v Speaker 2>fully aroused that they're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight like you,</v>

1465
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:15.650
<v Speaker 2>you are operating at about 10 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your normal resources like aids,</v>

1466
01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:16.830
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's got a.</v>

1467
01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:21.260
<v Speaker 2>He's still got a little bit with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>code.</v>

1468
01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Will the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1469
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.453
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that it was just primarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people in drug users that we're </v>

1470
01:10:29.361 --> 01:10:31.670
<v Speaker 2>getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a weird disease man.</v>

1471
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one man.</v>

1472
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.433
<v Speaker 2>That's a strange thing when your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts weakening and shutting down like </v>

1473
01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:40.784
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you really think about the </v>

1474
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:43.394
<v Speaker 2>actual danger and death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think even while aids was in its </v>

1475
01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:48.644
<v Speaker 2>height of killing people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was killing people as </v>

1476
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 2>much as the flu was right.</v>

1477
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.670
<v Speaker 5>The numbers I'm finding now or depending</v>
<v Speaker 5>on worldwide or us.</v>

1478
01:10:58.210 --> 01:10:59.043
<v Speaker 5>So worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tuberculosis is now killing more people </v>

1479
01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:04.960
<v Speaker 5>than aids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this says that only one point,</v>

1480
01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:09.640
<v Speaker 5>1 million people today in the us are </v>
<v Speaker 5>living with aids and I think I saw,</v>

1481
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.593
<v Speaker 2>but living with aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're at the border of </v>

1482
01:11:12.641 --> 01:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>getting aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1483
01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:15.390
<v Speaker 2>It's liKe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1484
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 2>you have h supposedly this again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a dOctor.</v>

1485
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly it's like you have hiv,</v>

1486
01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:26.850
<v Speaker 2>your immune system gets weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You catch aids,</v>

1487
01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:28.830
<v Speaker 2>which is acquired immune deficiency </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndrome,</v>

1488
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:29.664
<v Speaker 2>which means your t cell levels have </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached a certain count where they </v>

1489
01:11:31.531 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 2>identify it as aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1490
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT actually did type in a tennis is </v>

1491
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 2>going to hiv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1492
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.013
<v Speaker 2>They're definitely connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not people that also their </v>

1493
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 2>immune system fails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's outside of hiv.</v>

1494
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.260
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I clicked on this.</v>

1495
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll share what I clicked on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I typed in that end,</v>

1496
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:50.940
<v Speaker 2>and this is showing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says at one point 2 million people,</v>

1497
01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:53.910
<v Speaker 2>I received an aids diagnosis since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early eighties.</v>

1498
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Since the early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1499
01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 2>So 1 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there have been 12,000</v>

1500
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:03.900
<v Speaker 2>in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were 12,000,</v>

1501
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:04.763
<v Speaker 2>333 deaths due to any cause of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with diagnosed hiv infection ever </v>

1502
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 2>classified as aids and what does that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean then at $6?</v>

1503
01:12:16.951 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 2>A weird way of saying it with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it again.</v>

1504
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:21.023
<v Speaker 2>It says there were 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>333 deaths due to any cause of people </v>

1505
01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 2>with diagnosed hiv infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever classified as aids.</v>

1506
01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a strange way of saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:36.283
<v Speaker 2>With the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that immedion could </v>

1508
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:39.800
<v Speaker 2>lose the declassification if your immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>system gets strong enough.</v>

1509
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.693
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says with diagnosed hiv infection </v>

1510
01:12:42.921 --> 01:12:44.720
<v Speaker 2>ever classified as aids.</v>

1511
01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are the.</v>

1512
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:48.143
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayBe I'm too stupid for that because </v>

1513
01:12:48.951 --> 01:12:51.560
<v Speaker 2>what I also saw was that a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people died last year from it,</v>

1514
01:12:51.561 --> 01:12:52.394
<v Speaker 2>but that'd be worldwide and this then </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradicts because it says a million </v>

1515
01:12:54.741 --> 01:12:58.070
<v Speaker 2>people have only been diagnosed and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only in the us and that other numbers</v>

1516
01:12:58.071 --> 01:12:58.904
<v Speaker 2>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gets really sketchy anD it says </v>

1517
01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:04.190
<v Speaker 2>6,721</v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths were attributed directly to hiv.</v>

1518
01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems that they,</v>

1519
01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:09.860
<v Speaker 2>they definitely think it's still killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1520
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Definitely still is tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is,</v>

1521
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:16.400
<v Speaker 2>how many people die from the flu every </v>
<v Speaker 2>year?</v>

1522
01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.320
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you would you think would be the</v>

1523
01:13:20.321 --> 01:13:21.850
<v Speaker 2>most?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most ruthless,</v>

1524
01:13:21.851 --> 01:13:24.940
<v Speaker 2>normal killer would be the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flu would kill the most people.</v>

1525
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:26.253
<v Speaker 2>Thirty 6,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way more way more people Got jacked by </v>

1526
01:13:29.831 --> 01:13:33.040
<v Speaker 2>the flu every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every year.</v>

1527
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:36.670
<v Speaker 2>And what was the number from the aids </v>
<v Speaker 2>number was total,</v>

1528
01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:37.504
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of those people that flu shots </v>

1529
01:13:39.191 --> 01:13:40.300
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1530
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a third or so.</v>

1531
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:45.933
<v Speaker 2>So what's the third aids to the flu?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aids is about one slash third of the </v>

1532
01:13:49.271 --> 01:13:54.271
<v Speaker 2>deaths of the flu per year on average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm that interesting.</v>

1533
01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're not scared of the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kills us way more.</v>

1534
01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.113
<v Speaker 2>We're really scared of the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kills less people because it kills them </v>

1535
01:14:03.611 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 2>through butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1536
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.153
<v Speaker 2>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're terrified that it kills people </v>

1537
01:14:10.871 --> 01:14:11.704
<v Speaker 2>through</v>

1538
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.903
<v Speaker 3>because like the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like we should really be </v>

1539
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:17.530
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing's killing way more people.</v>

1540
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:21.670
<v Speaker 3>People not washing their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>

1541
01:14:21.671 --> 01:14:23.500
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't stop that,</v>

1542
01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 3>but we can stop all of his buttocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

1543
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird like when we have.</v>

1544
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:30.403
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just because it's a new thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was kiLling people because it </v>

1545
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't exist and then it did exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what it is,</v>

1546
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1547
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:38.703
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it came out of nowhere because </v>

1548
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:42.280
<v Speaker 3>it was in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it during the eighties?</v>

1549
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Murphy said,</v>

1550
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:46.180
<v Speaker 3>and you're walking around with the a's </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your lip.</v>

1551
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>

1552
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.483
<v Speaker 3>was that delirious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember sam kennison his bid on </v>

1553
01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:52.450
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1554
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.220
<v Speaker 3>they say sam shouldn't make fun of aids </v>
<v Speaker 3>aid.</v>

1555
01:14:55.221 --> 01:14:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Sam Is a communicable disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Straight people can get it to.</v>

1556
01:14:57.791 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1557
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not our dad's.</v>

1558
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 3>He had this crazy dangerous bit about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like way back then like,</v>

1559
01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.540
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a cro in around like 1980.</v>

1560
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1561
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:17.490
<v Speaker 3>So 1980 was the highest peak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's in thousands.</v>

1562
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.470
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like low.</v>

1563
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like it seems like late </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>

1564
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that somewhere around 1980?</v>

1565
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.100
<v Speaker 3>The one thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that there's around 300,000</v>

1566
01:15:27.101 --> 01:15:29.110
<v Speaker 3>total deaths and a third of them are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

1567
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.930
<v Speaker 3>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>total deaths,</v>

1568
01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 3>a third in New York and the flute and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all told ever.</v>

1569
01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the stats are all multiple pages.</v>

1570
01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:40.283
<v Speaker 3>So here's how many of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I get so confused about all this </v>

1571
01:15:43.601 --> 01:15:44.434
<v Speaker 3>shit because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people believe that a lot of these </v>

1572
01:15:47.591 --> 01:15:48.424
<v Speaker 3>people also were shooting heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these people were also doing a </v>

1573
01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 3>lot of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would wonder,</v>

1574
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:55.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're really partying hard and they</v>

1575
01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:56.650
<v Speaker 3>also get aids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1576
01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.573
<v Speaker 3>I would always wonder like how much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you partying hard is destroying your </v>

1577
01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:02.800
<v Speaker 3>immune system too.</v>

1578
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.720
<v Speaker 3>LIke if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a disease,</v>

1579
01:16:04.721 --> 01:16:05.554
<v Speaker 3>like say you have cancer and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling with cancer and you just </v>

1580
01:16:09.071 --> 01:16:13.390
<v Speaker 3>decided to hardcore start smoking meth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you die from the cancer.</v>

1581
01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Like is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

1582
01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:18.070
<v Speaker 3>didn't something else kill you too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1583
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Not saying that the cancer's good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1584
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.360
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly bad for you,</v>

1585
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:23.523
<v Speaker 3>but if you have cancer and just decided </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go on a meth binge and destroy your </v>

1586
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:29.980
<v Speaker 3>immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to contribute to your health,</v>

1587
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.140
<v Speaker 3>but we don't consider that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will consider up.</v>

1588
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.730
<v Speaker 3>They'll fucking cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got him.</v>

1589
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.773
<v Speaker 3>Cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got him.</v>

1590
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 3>It did get him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely did get them,</v>

1591
01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 3>but he was also smoke and math all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feeling good.</v>

1592
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Doing robberies or robberies with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking skulls.</v>

1593
01:16:45.041 --> 01:16:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Painted out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 7:11.</v>

1594
01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:50.830
<v Speaker 3>He was amped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude was amped with cancer.</v>

1595
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.220
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also.</v>

1596
01:16:52.221 --> 01:16:53.054
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he dies of a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the cancer gave him a heart </v>

1597
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:55.750
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:56.583
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That probably had something to do with </v>

1599
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:59.260
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>DefInitely was not good.</v>

1600
01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:00.123
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not good to have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also not good to be smoking </v>

1601
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:03.064
<v Speaker 3>meth while you have cancer smoking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how many of these people that got </v>

1602
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:10.520
<v Speaker 3>aids were like extremely healthy folks</v>

1603
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.593
<v Speaker 2>that like jogged on a regular basis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ate a lot of fruit and vegetables are </v>

1604
01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 2>hard to get that data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I would like to get that data.</v>

1605
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:20.150
<v Speaker 2>This is not like a prejudice </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

1606
01:17:20.151 --> 01:17:20.984
<v Speaker 2>I'm just as a curious person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to get all that I would </v>

1607
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:25.610
<v Speaker 2>like to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that actually does it?</v>

1608
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1609
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:31.820
<v Speaker 2>is it the method kills you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a disease that kills you?</v>

1610
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Is it a combination of all these things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always want to attribute death to one</v>

1611
01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:35.894
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that with all the </v>

1612
01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:42.800
<v Speaker 2>people that have died of the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a number of deaths.</v>

1613
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:43.880
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1614
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the flu could just catch you.</v>

1615
01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 2>The flu could just catch you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch you when you're already week two,</v>

1616
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.600
<v Speaker 2>maybe your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your rundown,</v>

1617
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you've been working too much and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the flu hits you.</v>

1618
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 2>When your immune system's devastated and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets deep into you and gets you.</v>

1619
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1620
01:18:00.771 --> 01:18:03.070
<v Speaker 2>the thing about diseases that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange to me,</v>

1621
01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:03.913
<v Speaker 2>so some of them are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain certain groups of people like </v>

1622
01:18:07.161 --> 01:18:07.994
<v Speaker 2>aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aids is one of those ones is just so </v>

1623
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:10.604
<v Speaker 2>associated with gay people that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really politically charged </v>

1624
01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 2>disease and we concentrate on it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really heavily.</v>

1625
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:18.163
<v Speaker 2>But I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think it wasn't just the gay </v>

1626
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:21.470
<v Speaker 2>thing was also that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was new,</v>

1627
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.633
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a new thing that was killing </v>

1628
01:18:23.751 --> 01:18:25.610
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were always worried about that.</v>

1629
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:26.444
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always these pandemic movies </v>

1630
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>where some new crazy disease breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose,</v>

1631
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:32.330
<v Speaker 2>just runs rampant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have an immune system for it.</v>

1632
01:18:32.331 --> 01:18:35.090
<v Speaker 2>People will start dying and they need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the medication to the people and get</v>

1633
01:18:35.091 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 2>it to the baby quickly.</v>

1634
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 2>People are putting it on subway subways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just always sOme shit like tHat.</v>

1635
01:18:41.211 --> 01:18:44.840
<v Speaker 2>We always have some new shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna get us swine flu,</v>

1636
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.960
<v Speaker 2>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was.</v>

1637
01:18:46.961 --> 01:18:47.794
<v Speaker 2>So aids had a dual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disadvaNtage one that is connected to </v>

1638
01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:54.180
<v Speaker 2>gay people and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1639
01:18:54.181 --> 01:18:57.440
<v Speaker 2>what do they do over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to get it?</v>

1640
01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1641
01:18:58.431 --> 01:18:59.264
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>TheRe was that and then there was also </v>

1642
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:03.070
<v Speaker 2>blood transfusions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>car accident.</v>

1643
01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:03.891
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1644
01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:06.200
<v Speaker 2>People were worried about getting from </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood transfusions,</v>

1645
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.093
<v Speaker 2>so that means back then they were never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like just letting random </v>

1646
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:13.730
<v Speaker 2>people donate blood without checking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they had a test for it for</v>

1647
01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.573
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for awhile they didn't have a </v>

1648
01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:17.930
<v Speaker 2>task for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they have to find like I guess they</v>

1649
01:19:17.931 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 2>have to find like antibodies in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood or some shit and like.</v>

1650
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:24.500
<v Speaker 2>But it's so weird that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all going on.</v>

1651
01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:27.650
<v Speaker 2>How many people were dying from cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year just from smoking cigarettes.</v>

1652
01:19:27.651 --> 01:19:30.950
<v Speaker 2>It'S fucking crazy numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy numbers.</v>

1653
01:19:30.951 --> 01:19:34.190
<v Speaker 2>People dropping like flies and no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks about that.</v>

1654
01:19:34.191 --> 01:19:35.024
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy smoking a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think that guys killing </v>

1655
01:19:36.921 --> 01:19:37.431
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1656
01:19:37.431 --> 01:19:38.264
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's outside and for the restaurant </v>

1657
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 2>having a cig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal shit.</v>

1658
01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Now that guy's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's poisoning themselves.</v>

1659
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.473
<v Speaker 2>Guy who delivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just strange to me like we get </v>

1660
01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:47.653
<v Speaker 2>really specific about what fears we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what way we die and when a </v>

1661
01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:55.520
<v Speaker 2>new disease comes along that becomes one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most specific ones,</v>

1662
01:19:55.670 --> 01:20:00.050
<v Speaker 2>but while you're indulging in all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors that will also kill you in way</v>

1663
01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:04.220
<v Speaker 2>larger numbers than diseases too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking weird man.</v>

1664
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human Beings,</v>

1665
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>me were so</v>

1666
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.963
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strange in the way we prioritize </v>

1667
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:13.440
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>

1668
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:14.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you get the flu shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1670
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Joey diaz though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't give up.</v>

1671
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:19.074
<v Speaker 1>The joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think had he has been born of the </v>

1672
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 1>best new bits about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got a flu shot,</v>

1673
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but I've gotten the flu once and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like two years ago out of nowhere,</v>

1674
01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:31.530
<v Speaker 1>man just came up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit a fat ass bowl to my legs,</v>

1675
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 1>got hot and my whole body felt hot and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told my wife,</v>

1676
01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:35.394
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've hiT a bowl and that's when it </v>

1677
01:20:38.011 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 1>came on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay with a bow,</v>

1678
01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>but that's when I started feeling hot.</v>

1679
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1680
01:20:43.801 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 3>we'd made you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of it?</v>

1681
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't the weekend though.</v>

1682
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Hey asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.431
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were struggling like,</v>

1684
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 3>hey asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the flu.</v>

1685
01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 3>You better pay attention to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a couple of years ago,</v>

1686
01:20:57.481 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 3>I kicked it quick because of heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I caught it coming on.</v>

1687
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 3>I felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1688
01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.660
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what this is.</v>

1689
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.970
<v Speaker 3>And I just laid down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't do shit.</v>

1690
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 3>I just laid down and drank a lot of tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chill the fuck out.</v>

1691
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:11.483
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just lay down and relax and let my </v>

1692
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:16.290
<v Speaker 3>body recuperate itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky that it was,</v>

1693
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.000
<v Speaker 3>it happened during a time where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't.</v>

1694
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have anything to do that day so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can take time off.</v>

1695
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I heard that when you get a real hot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>real a good flu,</v>

1696
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 1>it let your body fighting off something </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your body.</v>

1697
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's basically going to war.</v>

1698
01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sweating up a storm.</v>

1699
01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 3>The body's trying to chase out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>invaders.</v>

1700
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:38.320
<v Speaker 3>You got people trying to get over that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall in my body.</v>

1701
01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Your body has little organisms trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get over their walls.</v>

1702
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.810
<v Speaker 3>You got wall set up to keep these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>from breeding and you know,</v>

1703
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:50.790
<v Speaker 3>taking over parts of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got this immune system just going to</v>

1704
01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:51.624
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a little war going on in your </v>

1705
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:53.634
<v Speaker 3>body when you're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that everything is fighting to </v>

1706
01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Speaker 3>got pcp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I we'd fight and got cracked fighting.</v>

1707
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:00.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people don't like when you judge </v>

1708
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:04.283
<v Speaker 3>people's health and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you definitely shouldn't judge someone </v>

1709
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:11.661
<v Speaker 3>based on whether or not they're sick or </v>
<v Speaker 3>when what you're looking at when you see</v>

1710
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 3>people that are sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including yourself.</v>

1711
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:18.650
<v Speaker 3>All of us where we're looking at as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organism that is at war and we have this</v>

1712
01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:23.190
<v Speaker 3>weird instinct to kind of get awaY from </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1713
01:22:23.191 --> 01:22:23.911
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

1714
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 3>I could get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could get that organism,</v>

1715
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1716
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I got to get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if one of the troops,</v>

1717
01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:31.320
<v Speaker 3>troops jumps off of him and hops into </v>
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

1718
01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:32.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't afford to take time off work </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1719
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:33.744
<v Speaker 3>Get away from me.</v>

1720
01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for.</v>

1721
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't got time for your coughing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood,</v>

1722
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:40.300
<v Speaker 3>don't pump blood on a zombie man.</v>

1723
01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.320
<v Speaker 1>But look how many people like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't have,</v>

1724
01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.273
<v Speaker 1>who don't ever really take care of their</v>

1746
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.713
<v Speaker 1>I was out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the road and opened the low </v>

<v Speaker 1>So I was fucking with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat cheese and meat all week.</v>

1749
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:04.390
<v Speaker 1>you're bound up and I didn't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink no water.</v>

1750
01:24:04.391 --> 01:24:09.391
<v Speaker 1>I drink soda so I must've been stuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So joe,</v>

1751
01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the bathroom,</v>

1752
01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>like the show's over and like two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing right now.</v>

1753
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.500
<v Speaker 1>And they could feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1754
01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.490
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my butthole already felt like,</v>

1755
01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have broken glass inside.</v>

1756
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling.</v>

1757
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So I finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pushed too hard because I,</v>

1758
01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I pushed her like I was having a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waS like,</v>

1759
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I was doing mas and then up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube screen please.</v>

1760
01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:37.573
<v Speaker 1>So I fuck it up while he's talking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I pushed and I pushed and then </v>

1761
01:24:44.281 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aw man,</v>

1762
01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:46.114
<v Speaker 1>I could just feel I saw like I wiped </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and it might the toilet paper </v>

1763
01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking tampon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was in pain.</v>

1764
01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1765
01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:55.003
<v Speaker 3>It says the veins around your anus tend </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stretch under pressure and may bulge </v>

1766
01:24:57.981 --> 01:24:58.814
<v Speaker 3>or swell swollen veins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hemorrhoids can develop from increased </v>

1767
01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:07.631
<v Speaker 3>pressure in the lower rectum due to </v>
<v Speaker 3>straining during bowel movements,</v>

1768
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.110
<v Speaker 3>sitting for long periods of time on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>toilet.</v>

1769
01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Eddie bravo has a hilarious bit about it</v>

1770
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:17.470
<v Speaker 1>being on his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on his phone and taking a shit.</v>

1771
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.660
<v Speaker 1>It's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

1772
01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:21.820
<v Speaker 1>didn't he talk about it on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've talked about it on here,</v>

1773
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:25.660
<v Speaker 1>NOt good for your butthole to be sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

1775
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.270
<v Speaker 1>How would describe the position of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain?</v>

1776
01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:29.290
<v Speaker 1>It feels like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1777
01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.433
<v Speaker 1>I remember talking about in a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that it felt like every night </v>

1778
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.240
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goals sort of siloed by using me.</v>

1779
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you in the ass at night.</v>

1780
01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.750
<v Speaker 1>How many days did you go before he took </v>
<v Speaker 1>a shut off?</v>

1781
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the share,</v>

1782
01:25:43.821 --> 01:25:44.654
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the pain started and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>blew my butthole out I guess and then </v>

1783
01:25:48.251 --> 01:25:49.084
<v Speaker 1>like three days later I didn't shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>right without paying for like two weeks </v>

1784
01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid of fucking neat man</v>

1785
01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.233
<v Speaker 3>about to go to a doctor and they had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally break up the shit in his butt </v>

1786
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:01.144
<v Speaker 3>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to go up as bought with an </v>

1787
01:26:02.611 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>instrument and break it up</v>

1788
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>and flush him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give him something.</v>

1789
01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.273
<v Speaker 2>I think he had to take something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of diuretic and some stool </v>

1790
01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:10.964
<v Speaker 2>loosening agent like some hardcore drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they had to go in there with </v>

1791
01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:15.174
<v Speaker 2>like a chisel and chop off this concrete</v>
<v Speaker 2>log that he at the bottom of his button </v>

1792
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.490
<v Speaker 2>and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1793
01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.500
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't shit in many days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to.</v>

1794
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was dangerous and he couldn't get it </v>

1795
01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:29.390
<v Speaker 2>out so he was literally plugged up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it kept piling in.</v>

1796
01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's going to stop eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to keep piling in.</v>

1797
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:37.510
<v Speaker 2>So he's got a blockade of like shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks at the end of his booty tunnel and</v>

1798
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:40.700
<v Speaker 2>it's real property can be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So real problem.</v>

1799
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:41.563
<v Speaker 2>He had to go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My life finally came out and then a </v>

1800
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.670
<v Speaker 2>clink clink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but It was all bad with all dry,</v>

1801
01:26:46.671 --> 01:26:48.540
<v Speaker 2>with ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painful.</v>

1802
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:51.700
<v Speaker 2>You gotta eat your vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed my speed.</v>

1803
01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 2>And after I finished paying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hurting my butthole after I peed.</v>

1804
01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:56.503
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one thing that I freak out</v>
<v Speaker 2>about people that are on this carnivore </v>

1805
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:00.944
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear this carnivore diet stuff and </v>

1806
01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:03.081
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1807
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 2>no problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem at all.</v>

1808
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't eat any vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got no problem at all.</v>

1809
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:09.423
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't really kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat some broccoli with that little kale </v>

<v Speaker 2>killing you.</v>

1812
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:20.320
<v Speaker 2>I think if broccoli's killing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.360
<v Speaker 2>In general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broccoli is safe to eat.</v>

1832
01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:00.194
<v Speaker 2>Any side effects or not serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most common side effect is gas or bowel </v>

1833
01:28:04.011 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 2>irritation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli farts caused by broccoli's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High amounts of fiber.</v>

1835
01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.330

<v Speaker 2>That's a great word.</v>

1836
01:28:11.331 --> 01:28:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Cruciferous vegetables can make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>grassy.</v>

1839
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 2>or are you a scIentist or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You?</v>

1840
01:28:19.821 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1841
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:23.390
<v Speaker 2>When you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you scientific terms,</v>

1842
01:28:23.391 --> 01:28:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you don't say gassy with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's scared saying farts.</v>

1843
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.513
<v Speaker 2>Gassy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the health benefits outweigh the </v>

1844
01:28:29.901 --> 01:28:30.950
<v Speaker 2>discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1845
01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's certain people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1846
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.153
<v Speaker 2>that I think have a real physical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Jordan Peterson is wonderful when </v>

1847
01:28:36.861 --> 01:28:37.694
<v Speaker 2>it describes like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he literally can't have anything other </v>

1848
01:28:40.401 --> 01:28:41.234
<v Speaker 2>than me and at this point in his life or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives them headaches and it fucks </v>

1849
01:28:44.811 --> 01:28:45.644
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think certain people may all bullshit </v>

1850
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:49.484
<v Speaker 2>aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might have a real biological issue with </v>

1851
01:28:51.651 --> 01:28:53.420
<v Speaker 2>vegetabLes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds insane,</v>

1852
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.810
<v Speaker 2>but it only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have a problem with everything is</v>

1853
01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>there's certain people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with almost everything.</v>

1854
01:29:00.351 --> 01:29:01.184
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are to citrus as </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are allergic to certain </v>

1855
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:06.180
<v Speaker 2>cahtos yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of plants.</v>

1856
01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are allergic to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass.</v>

1857
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't be allergic to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables?</v>

1858
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.593
<v Speaker 2>So if you are allergic to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and you just go on an all </v>

1859
01:29:16.111 --> 01:29:19.260
<v Speaker 2>meat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those symptoms of those allergies go</v>

1860
01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1861
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.693
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't that make sense to people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many people fighting </v>

1862
01:29:24.121 --> 01:29:24.954
<v Speaker 2>off the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this carnivore diet that you're only </v>

1863
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:28.644
<v Speaker 2>eating meat and you feel fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably dealing with a bunch of </v>

1864
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:35.640
<v Speaker 2>people that have undiagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions,</v>

1865
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.863
<v Speaker 2>negative interactions with vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably something about their </v>

1866
01:29:40.711 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 2>system that does not go well with </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>

1867
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:43.854
<v Speaker 2>so they should take vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take vitamins and eat meat and you </v>

1868
01:29:46.231 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 2>better find a way to get fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids.</v>

1869
01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get all backed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegetables are good.</v>

1870
01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I think if you eat like a really fatty </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat though,</v>

1871
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:58.740
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you eat like a ton of rib eyes,</v>

1872
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.960
<v Speaker 2>it just greases up that whole pipeline </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1873
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.540
<v Speaker 2>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything comes flying out.</v>

1874
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I think when you start eating that lean </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground bison meat,</v>

1875
01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:08.413
<v Speaker 2>you know no butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're gonna have a problem for </v>

1876
01:30:10.670 --> 01:30:11.503
<v Speaker 2>butterball.</v>

1877
01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:12.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You chew that shit down and pack it </v>

1878
01:30:13.381 --> 01:30:15.300
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you water on top of it.</v>

1879
01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:18.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you go like the pack that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bison here and then you've got the water</v>

1880
01:30:18.721 --> 01:30:20.880
<v Speaker 2>behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's concrete a fine.</v>

1881
01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Find its way through your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have some broccoli,</v>

1882
01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.570
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill.</v>

1883
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:26.543
<v Speaker 2>Put some cheese on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people really firmly believe that </v>

1884
01:30:29.191 --> 01:30:31.830
<v Speaker 2>dairy is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something I've never tried.</v>

1885
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.990
<v Speaker 2>I've never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1886
01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:33.770
<v Speaker 2>had dairy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1887
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:34.021
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1888
01:30:34.021 --> 01:30:34.854
<v Speaker 2>To not have dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never tried to like way off 100 </v>

1889
01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:39.090
<v Speaker 2>percent dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat much,</v>

1890
01:30:39.091 --> 01:30:39.924
<v Speaker 2>but if I do it's mostly cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hardly ever drink milk unless it's with </v>

1891
01:30:43.051 --> 01:30:45.330
<v Speaker 2>cookies and whenever I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always feel weird.</v>

1892
01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I need milk I shouldn't.</v>

1893
01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.413
<v Speaker 2>Myself.</v>

1894
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I've been my whole life to them tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't even know that.</v>

1895
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:55.283
<v Speaker 2>My mom never told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time I'm eating cheese I have </v>

1896
01:30:57.901 --> 01:31:00.690
<v Speaker 2>problem against the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll come out to him.</v>

1897
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 2>So I fought with almond milk and soy </v>
<v Speaker 2>milk now.</v>

1898
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you fuck with vegan cheese?</v>

1899
01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Everything big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>only meeting no more.</v>

1900
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 2>When did you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't have.</v>

1901
01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Fuck my asshole blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1902
01:31:10.891 --> 01:31:12.840

<v Speaker 2>Fucked up the fiber.</v>

1903
01:31:12.841 --> 01:31:17.220
<v Speaker 2>And you feel good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel fat?</v>

1904
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.340
<v Speaker 2>People don't believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The theory.</v>

1905
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking fat.</v>

1906
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:24.000
<v Speaker 2>What crops do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you opposed to eggs?</v>

1907
01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the.</v>

1912
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the runs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You ever try out this other types of </v>

1914
01:31:43.801 --> 01:31:45.550
<v Speaker 2>diets or is this the first one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1915
01:31:45.551 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I tried being a vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried the atkins diet,</v>

1916
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I tried the hollywood diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1917
01:31:52.170 --> 01:31:56.500
<v Speaker 2>when you wake up in the morning and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>some coke and it sucked.</v>

1918
01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I never tried that one.</v>

1919
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>are you trying to lose weight or you're </v>

1921
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1922
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:05.944
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't lose weight but I was bigger </v>

1923
01:32:07.451 --> 01:32:11.730
<v Speaker 1>than I am right now because of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1924
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's not really a diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started this in 2011 or 2012.</v>

1925
01:32:18.521 --> 01:32:19.354
<v Speaker 1>And you said when your ass was bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you decided that's where </v>

1926
01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>they started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started off slow.</v>

1927
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.033
<v Speaker 1>I just stopped drinking milk first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I thought was cheesed then meet </v>

1928
01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>with the hardest fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken little slow.</v>

1929
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And what do you replace it with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of foods?</v>

1930
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 1>My wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was raised vegan in dayton,</v>

1931
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:44.671
<v Speaker 1>Ohio by her mom dam and you know the and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were poor so they grew up in a,</v>

1932
01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:46.573
<v Speaker 1>in a trailer park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that must have been tough for them </v>

1933
01:32:48.641 --> 01:32:51.270
<v Speaker 1>being vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just started little by little,</v>

1934
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:52.623
<v Speaker 1>it helped me because she will not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at the time when I started being </v>

1935
01:32:56.171 --> 01:32:57.004
<v Speaker 1>vegan.</v>

1936

1942
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:12.274

<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to get my blood tested this</v>

01:33:24.401 --> 01:33:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Do they do all that kind of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tests your vitamin d levels.</v>

1947

<v Speaker 1>You got into the ice things rough.</v>

1953
01:33:47.410 --> 01:33:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what's good to saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saunas are usually nine degrees.</v>

1954
01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that like a different side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head with the why?</v>

1955
01:33:59.151 --> 01:34:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Mca right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saunas.</v>

1956
01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:03.880
<v Speaker 1>The same steam rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dIfferent steam room is like if,</v>

1957
01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.600
<v Speaker 1>if steam gets out or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a,</v>

1958
01:34:07.601 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 1>it really is like in the implementation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it more than anything,</v>

1959
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:13.690
<v Speaker 1>but if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a steam room,</v>

1960
01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 1>most likely was a tile floor and you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there with a towel,</v>

1961
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Florida oil last door and it just hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>steam and everybody just gets hot in </v>

1962
01:34:22.941 --> 01:34:24.850
<v Speaker 1>there and then they get to sweating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave,</v>

1963
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:25.923
<v Speaker 1>but the song is different in that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dry heat so you go in there and it's </v>

1964
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.930
<v Speaker 1>usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea is,</v>

1965
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:32.764
<v Speaker 1>and I could be wrong here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the idea is that the steam </v>

1966
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Speaker 1>room can't get as hot as a song because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it did,</v>

1967
01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 1>it would kind of cook you because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wet.</v>

1968
01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:39.993
<v Speaker 1>It would be like hot wet air around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of cook you as opposed to the </v>

1969
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:45.670
<v Speaker 1>hot dry air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1970
01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.080
<v Speaker 1>It's touching little hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hot rocks at the sauna.</v>

1971
01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 1>The sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's conducted waters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waters conducting the heat.</v>

1973
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1974
01:34:55.210 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So the air doesn't conduct the heat as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1975
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:58.260
<v Speaker 1>The water does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1976
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 2>so that's makes sense because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sauna.</v>

1977
01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 2>You can get to a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crispy degree,</v>

1978
01:35:04.170 --> 01:35:06.560
<v Speaker 2>crispy temperature before you body </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to freak out.</v>

1979
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:10.550
<v Speaker 2>That's like the old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Highlight the rat pack,</v>

1980
01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.593
<v Speaker 2>so not trying to sit around the song and</v>
<v Speaker 2>party all night and then take a little </v>

1981
01:35:15.051 --> 01:35:17.290
<v Speaker 2>steam in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get all the alcohol.</v>

1982
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:18.463
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make you feel a little </v>

1983
01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:21.231
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>If you fucked up from drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could also run the risk of could you</v>

1985
01:35:25.491 --> 01:35:27.970
<v Speaker 2>might be dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could run the risk of blacking out.</v>

1986
01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>

1987
01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.790
<v Speaker 2>If you're susceptible to that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at them all there,</v>

1988
01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.040
<v Speaker 2>he's on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches on the phone,</v>

1989
01:35:36.570 --> 01:35:40.220
<v Speaker 2>is there in the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>landau,</v>

1990
01:35:40.221 --> 01:35:42.440
<v Speaker 2>look at these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1991
01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd the photographer get in there,</v>

1992
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:48.230
<v Speaker 2>but I call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call bullshit the phone.</v>

1993
01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:49.063
<v Speaker 2>I call bullshit with the photographer </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the ocean's 11 where we know </v>

1994
01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.930
<v Speaker 2>probably really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he did iT all the time and they</v>

1995
01:35:54.931 --> 01:35:55.310
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1996
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:58.350
<v Speaker 2>come on in and take a picture of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we do.</v>

1997
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Guys were having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly.</v>

1998
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I remember the time they were having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good time man.</v>

1999
01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2000
01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Like in their fifties there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2001
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:07.034
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were older guys and they got </v>

2002
01:36:08.541 --> 01:36:09.374
<v Speaker 2>together and they just did whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they wanted and they'd go to vegas </v>

2003
01:36:11.811 --> 01:36:12.644
<v Speaker 2>and party and everybody wanted to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>party with them there at the sands </v>

2004
01:36:15.691 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sand.</v>

2005
01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.530
<v Speaker 2>The says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2006
01:36:18.531 --> 01:36:21.380
<v Speaker 2>When you look at those old hotels and </v>
<v Speaker 2>casinos in vegas,</v>

2007
01:36:21.381 --> 01:36:22.214
<v Speaker 2>they just decided to dynamite item,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what would you give to to stay in </v>

2008
01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:26.744
<v Speaker 2>the sands today if they kept everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to date but current with the era in </v>

2009
01:36:32.931 --> 01:36:33.860
<v Speaker 2>which it was created.</v>

2010
01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:34.923
<v Speaker 2>like if you went there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a total retro hotel room with </v>

2011
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:40.410
<v Speaker 2>like fucking dial up phones and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2012
01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:44.760
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's god,</v>

2013
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:46.530
<v Speaker 2>there's something to be said for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2014
01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live in a log cabin,</v>

2015
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:51.620
<v Speaker 2>like there's something really cool about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a log cabin,</v>

2016
01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

2017
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you're living in a way that people lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this a thousand years ago.</v>

2018
01:36:56.670 --> 01:36:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real.</v>

2019
01:36:58.131 --> 01:36:58.964
<v Speaker 2>This is really how people live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no one wants to live like people </v>

2020
01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:03.270
<v Speaker 2>lived in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2021
01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.280
<v Speaker 2>like if they had a place like that where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had all the same kind of furniture,</v>

2022
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.710
<v Speaker 2>just updated all the same law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tensiles yeah.</v>

2023
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:15.770
<v Speaker 2>But have that shit like they had it back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

2024
01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.690
<v Speaker 2>How many people would want that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

2025
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:19.543
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like vegas was only made possible </v>

2026
01:37:21.711 --> 01:37:24.030
<v Speaker 2>because of air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2027
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:25.123
<v Speaker 2>Water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't have pulled that off if </v>

2028
01:37:26.931 --> 01:37:29.240
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have some sort of way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool the place down.</v>

2029
01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:34.890
<v Speaker 2>When did that start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a good question.</v>

2030
01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I've got a bit hottest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2031
01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.184
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice house where we do stand up was </v>

2032
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:47.170
<v Speaker 2>his 58 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before that it was some sort of a,</v>

2033
01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it was some sort of,</v>

2034
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:52.583
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual ice house where they bring it </v>

2035
01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:55.501
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point.</v>

2036
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It's history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it used to be.</v>

2037
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:57.833
<v Speaker 2>It used to be a storage place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that didn't have frigerators </v>

2038
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the whole place it would buy</v>

2039
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 2>a block of ice and they would take this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice and they carry it home.</v>

2040
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't that long ago,</v>

2041
01:38:08.401 --> 01:38:10.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's less than 100 years ago.</v>

2042
01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So late 1947.</v>

2043
01:38:14.551 --> 01:38:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Bugsy siegel flamingo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2044
01:38:16.681 --> 01:38:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I bet it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it couldn't be.</v>

2045
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we've probably,</v>

2046
01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:21.494
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just forgotten because I'm too </v>

2047
01:38:23.161 --> 01:38:25.220
<v Speaker 2>stupid to maintain all this information </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2048
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:28.340
<v Speaker 2>My brain's overfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2049
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it happened somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the 19 twenties.</v>

2050
01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 2>The 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2051
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.090
<v Speaker 2>There was no refrigerators for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>

2052
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Refrigerators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2053
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Is air conditioning in vegas as I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at.</v>

2054
01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.441
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

2055
01:38:40.441 --> 01:38:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I was rambling.</v>

2056
01:38:43.410 --> 01:38:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I was going with bulk of siena was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a mango,</v>

2057
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:48.300
<v Speaker 2>so air conditioning and refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're definitely,</v>

2058
01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.273
<v Speaker 2>we went with the ice house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a blocks of ice that they used </v>

2059
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:52.254
<v Speaker 2>to use for ice boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When do you think they invented the </v>

2060
01:38:55.321 --> 01:38:57.780
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator where they didn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that for the refrigerator.</v>

2061
01:38:57.781 --> 01:39:01.890
<v Speaker 2>The ice chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll check,</v>

2062
01:39:01.891 --> 01:39:04.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think they pr man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with air conditioning,</v>

2063
01:39:04.501 --> 01:39:05.670
<v Speaker 2>the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2064
01:39:05.710 --> 01:39:06.543
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big roaring times of the vegas </v>

2065
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 2>eruption was probably right after that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had to be like right after it was</v>

2066
01:39:13.441 --> 01:39:14.274
<v Speaker 2>invented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there was different type of </v>

2067
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:18.450
<v Speaker 2>condition that though the standard air </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition that we have now,</v>

2068
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.400
<v Speaker 2>but I used to work at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to work at sears roebuck's and in</v>

2069
01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:26.560
<v Speaker 2>boyle heights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an old sears building and they 87,</v>

2070
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:27.403
<v Speaker 2>it was a big earthquake and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>working there and that's in all the </v>

2071
01:39:30.121 --> 01:39:30.954
<v Speaker 2>water came down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a swamp cooler so it's like a </v>

2072
01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.153
<v Speaker 2>big show with a bunch of water in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really an old aIr </v>

2073
01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:42.500
<v Speaker 2>conditioner by the mid to late 1930 </v>
<v Speaker 2>swamp coolers.</v>

2074
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Homes by maybe 15 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but added humidity.</v>

2075
01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 2>It was bad dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>swamp coolers.</v>

2076
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I liked the name and swamp coolers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was luck.</v>

2077
01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I had to clean one of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers.</v>

2078
01:39:58.411 --> 01:39:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was huge.</v>

2079
01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:03.300
<v Speaker 2>It was bigger than that for the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>building that it's crazy.</v>

2080
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.630
<v Speaker 2>And it broke another one who came down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2081
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:08.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Air conditioning.</v>

2082
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:11.160
<v Speaker 2>If you live in the northeast in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>summertime,</v>

2083
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:13.820
<v Speaker 2>it gets wet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I lived in boston,</v>

2084
01:40:13.821 --> 01:40:17.730
<v Speaker 2>there was a wet place like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the summertime would come around,</v>

2085
01:40:17.731 --> 01:40:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't just be that it was hot out.</v>

2086
01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:21.890
<v Speaker 2>It was hot and wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2087
01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:24.990
<v Speaker 2>things get sweaty as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mosquitoes are everywhere.</v>

2088
01:40:24.991 --> 01:40:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real muggy.</v>

2089
01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's cool because you're,</v>

2090
01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:31.020
<v Speaker 2>you realize it's not going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>very long,</v>

2091
01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like when,</v>

2092
01:40:32.181 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 2>when it is muggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about like real contrast,</v>

2093
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:38.460
<v Speaker 2>whether that's one thing we just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in California,</v>

2094
01:40:38.461 --> 01:40:39.630
<v Speaker 2>we don't get a contrast.</v>

2095
01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:40.853
<v Speaker 2>If you live in a place like New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a summer that is brutally </v>

2096
01:40:44.101 --> 01:40:47.520
<v Speaker 2>hot and muggy and people are walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and sweating and they're like,</v>

2097
01:40:47.521 --> 01:40:49.250
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hot out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can't wait to get on that train or </v>

<v Speaker 2>You just got to get out of this fucking </v>

2102

<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

2107
01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's good for people who don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hill here,</v>

2108
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:20.230
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right here in turns 70 leg warmers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They can do whatever they want.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2156
01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.810
<v Speaker 2>we should be supporting each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll help everybody.</v>

01:43:41.521 --> 01:43:42.354
<v Speaker 2>Be happy like we inspire each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were not competing against each </v>

2160
01:43:45.211 --> 01:43:46.650
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone does well.</v>

2161
01:43:46.770 --> 01:43:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't say fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say god damn he did it.</v>

2162
01:43:49.351 --> 01:43:50.184
<v Speaker 2>I could do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see the amount of energy can be </v>

2163
01:43:52.521 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 2>put into both ways of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one way is so much more positive for</v>

2164
01:43:56.301 --> 01:43:57.134
<v Speaker 2>you and for everybody around you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>still allows you to have a competitive </v>

2165
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 2>instinct because you're still competing </v>
<v Speaker 2>against yourself.</v>

2166
01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.793
<v Speaker 2>You competing to do better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're looking at the people around </v>

2167
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 2>you as inspiration rather than its </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

2168
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:10.280
<v Speaker 2>and so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of having this negative,</v>

2169
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 2>combative relationship with everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you,</v>

2170
01:44:12.351 --> 01:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>that's also succeeding you have is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really cooperative,</v>

2171
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.390
<v Speaker 2>excited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling about it.</v>

2172
01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2173
01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:23.060
<v Speaker 2>that's entirely possible in in business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's entirely possible and friendship.</v>

2174
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:27.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's how people should try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should aspire to interact,</v>

2175
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:28.243
<v Speaker 2>interface with things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always try to be as positive as you can </v>

2176
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:31.543
<v Speaker 2>to give the same amount of energy you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can give towards positive and still </v>

2177
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:35.653
<v Speaker 2>fulfill all those same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts of like kicking ass and doing </v>

2178
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:41.720
<v Speaker 2>well or do it against yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like compete against yourself.</v>

2179
01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:42.613
<v Speaker 2>Don't think about it as those other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are taking something away from </v>

2180
01:44:44.481 --> 01:44:45.314
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about as they're giving you an </v>

2181
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:47.840
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to look at what's possible.</v>

2182
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.673
<v Speaker 2>If you really dedicate yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should choose that as a valuable life </v>

2183
01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:52.550
<v Speaker 2>lesson like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Six nine.</v>

2337
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And he can box his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very slick,</v>

2338
01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:26.650
<v Speaker 2>like deceptively slick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2339
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 2>he's a traveler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like one of them.</v>

2340
01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:29.403
<v Speaker 2>Bad ass gypsy dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's quite a few of those in </v>

2341
01:52:31.331 --> 01:52:32.164
<v Speaker 2>boxing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are tough fucking people and he </v>

2342
01:52:37.451 --> 01:52:40.110
<v Speaker 2>can perform under pressure to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2343
01:52:40.111 --> 01:52:41.920
<v Speaker 2>he gets loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This huge man.</v>

2344
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 2>He's so big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenny box.</v>

2345
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>He can box hIs ass off man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know why this guy.</v>

2346
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:48.643
<v Speaker 2>So they're just standing in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and like they were fucking </v>

2347
01:52:49.971 --> 01:52:52.950
<v Speaker 2>around like two rounds and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>landed some blows.</v>

2348
01:52:53.250 --> 01:52:54.083
<v Speaker 2>Go down here and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what happens at the end </v>

2349
01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.350
<v Speaker 2>because if the guy just quit and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was no,</v>

2350
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:05.300
<v Speaker 2>there was no poInt where he was hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's disgraceful stuff.</v>

2351
01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 2>So he's beating them up here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2352
01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Well tyson fury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2353
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.863
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's of the jet woRld championship </v>

2354
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:18.470
<v Speaker 2>caliber boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beat vladimir klitschko in his prime.</v>

2355
01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:19.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the end of his reign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was still in his prime because </v>

2356
01:53:21.741 --> 01:53:23.000
<v Speaker 2>his next fight against anthony.</v>

2357
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Joshua was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Klitschko knocked joshua down,</v>

2358
01:53:26.061 --> 01:53:27.920
<v Speaker 2>had joshua deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep trouble.</v>

2359
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:32.030
<v Speaker 2>And then joshua came back and stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and joshua knocked him down first.</v>

2360
01:53:32.031 --> 01:53:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Then he knocked joshua down second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like anthony.</v>

2361
01:53:34.521 --> 01:53:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Joshua was clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the best,</v>

2362
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:37.723
<v Speaker 2>at least it's between him and deontay </v>
<v Speaker 2>wilder right now until they fight the </v>

2363
01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most dangerous heavyweights of our era.</v>

2364
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:46.370
<v Speaker 2>And klitschko almost beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost knocked him out.</v>

2365
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:47.383
<v Speaker 2>So when tyson fury beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that he was beating a prime time </v>

2366
01:53:50.271 --> 01:53:53.630
<v Speaker 2>klitschko and he just outboxed him man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dude just quit.</v>

2367
01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.980
<v Speaker 2>What was he good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was he getting beat up our.</v>

2368
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I was talking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2369
01:53:58.450 --> 01:53:59.660
<v Speaker 2>go a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit more.</v>

2370
01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:03.500
<v Speaker 2>So is the end of the round all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highlights.</v>

2371
01:54:03.501 --> 01:54:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean theY probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2372
01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:07.130
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was getting hurt.</v>

2373
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:09.350
<v Speaker 2>He was gettIng hurt for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He right there.</v>

2374
01:54:09.351 --> 01:54:11.060
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2375
01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:13.170
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2376
01:54:13.190 --> 01:54:16.250
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out a way to mitigate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2377
01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to figure out when.</v>

2378
01:54:18.610 --> 01:54:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's going back to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his corner.</v>

2379
01:54:20.531 --> 01:54:21.364
<v Speaker 2>He's not wobbling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be trying to figure </v>

2380
01:54:23.781 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 2>out a way to get past that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't figure out a way to get</v>

2381
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:27.194
<v Speaker 2>past that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2382
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:28.363
<v Speaker 2>why'd you take the fight?</v>

2383
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:31.483
<v Speaker 2>But I guess I guess he probably thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>he could beat that guy before he got in </v>

2384
01:54:34.641 --> 01:54:35.474
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then while you're in the middle of </v>

2385
01:54:36.201 --> 01:54:37.034
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens?</v>

2386
01:54:37.130 --> 01:54:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Who that happens to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loma chanko,</v>

2387
01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.700
<v Speaker 2>lemme chanko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's just quit.</v>

2388
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Guys quit on their corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldclass guys,</v>

2389
01:54:43.521 --> 01:54:44.720
<v Speaker 2>they're on their corner and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2390
01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.940
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back out there.</v>

2391
01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.510
<v Speaker 2>There was like one of his more recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights against a really high level guy,</v>

2392
01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:52.250
<v Speaker 2>loma checkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

2393
01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.100
<v Speaker 2>He boxes guys out so convinced and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2394
01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:56.030
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going out.</v>

2395
01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy keeps teeing off of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making it.</v>

2396
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:59.683
<v Speaker 2>We're cutting the shit short right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll do it with a straight face </v>

2397
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:06.110
<v Speaker 2>but like enough of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's because he's so much better.</v>

2398
01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Like what you've seen with tyson fury </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2399
01:55:08.151 --> 01:55:08.984
<v Speaker 2>That guy was definitely getting beat up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe he definitely needed to stop </v>

2400
01:55:11.451 --> 01:55:12.284
<v Speaker 2>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way he's getting beat up is not </v>

2401
01:55:15.261 --> 01:55:17.120
<v Speaker 2>like the same way loma chanko does.</v>

2402
01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Like when loma triangle does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the end is near son.</v>

2403
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.660
<v Speaker 2>You better get off this fucking train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going right into a brick wall.</v>

2404
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.880
<v Speaker 2>You think their mind's not in it when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just give up.</v>

2405
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Who knows man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we didn't watch the actual fight.</v>

2406
01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.170
<v Speaker 2>He might've tyson fury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>

2407
01:55:30.171 --> 01:55:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I think probably hit them with some big </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots and you know,</v>

2408
01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at it from an outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

2409
01:55:34.821 --> 01:55:36.890
<v Speaker 2>but he knows he's in big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big trouble.</v>

2410
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:37.903
<v Speaker 2>It's a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people get they boo and they get </v>

2411
01:55:39.861 --> 01:55:43.350
<v Speaker 2>angry when someone who's a real warrior </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps out of fight,</v>

2412
01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>but I can</v>

2413
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.430
<v Speaker 3>remember when nigel benn fought gerald </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcclellan and it was a big,</v>

2414
01:55:47.431 --> 01:55:48.264
<v Speaker 3>big fight at the time because they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>both just knockout artists and crazy </v>

2415
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:51.654
<v Speaker 3>wild dudes with ferocious punching power</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gerald mcclellan cut a shit ton of </v>

2416
01:55:56.401 --> 01:55:57.234
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really way too much weight and he was a </v>

2417
01:55:59.221 --> 01:56:00.054
<v Speaker 3>really big light heavyweight and when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>went in there and fought gerald </v>

2418
01:56:03.481 --> 01:56:06.120
<v Speaker 3>mcclellan or when he fought a nodule </v>
<v Speaker 3>band,</v>

2419
01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:06.954
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a clash of heads and it was a </v>

2420
01:56:08.521 --> 01:56:12.810
<v Speaker 3>crazy like nonstop first round action </v>
<v Speaker 3>where jeremy mclellan hurt.</v>

2421
01:56:12.811 --> 01:56:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Nigel benn see if he could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy clough,</v>

2422
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:17.003
<v Speaker 3>gerald mcclellan hurt nigel benn knocked</v>
<v Speaker 3>him through the ropes and looked like </v>

2423
01:56:19.501 --> 01:56:22.350
<v Speaker 3>the fight was over and nigel band comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2424
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.333
<v Speaker 3>He gets back up and they're going at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a crazy headbutting there </v>

2425
01:56:26.161 --> 01:56:26.994
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and during the headbutt I mean they're </v>

2426
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:28.944
<v Speaker 3>throwing bombs back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm gerald mcclellan takes a knee </v>

2427
01:56:32.850 --> 01:56:37.070
<v Speaker 3>shortly afterwards and then goes to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner and stops and the,</v>

2428
01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.020
<v Speaker 3>the people that are watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember saying like,</v>

2429
01:56:40.021 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 3>why is he doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would he stop a fight like that</v>

2430
01:56:43.210 --> 01:56:44.850
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>

2431
01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fucked.</v>

2432
01:56:46.770 --> 01:56:50.450
<v Speaker 3>And then they take them to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is it.</v>

2433
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:52.860
<v Speaker 3>This is what says around 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right before,</v>

2434
01:56:52.861 --> 01:56:55.230
<v Speaker 3>I think this is right before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>headbutt.</v>

2435
01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So during the first round,</v>

2436
01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.373
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a shorter fight </v>

2437
01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:01.920
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>During the first round they had collided</v>

2438
01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:04.013
<v Speaker 3>and gerald mcclellan hit him with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>big shots and it looked like the fight </v>

2439
01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:08.154
<v Speaker 3>was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that was the first </v>

2440
01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:11.220
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>

2441
01:57:12.810 --> 01:57:14.580
<v Speaker 3>when whatever happened happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2442
01:57:14.581 --> 01:57:16.420
<v Speaker 3>look at that right hand by nigel pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2443
01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.110
<v Speaker 3>that's ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude.</v>

2444
01:57:18.111 --> 01:57:19.650
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally remember this wrong.</v>

2445
01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.030
<v Speaker 3>I remember a clash of heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

2446
01:57:24.031 --> 01:57:24.864
<v Speaker 3>I though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2447
01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I 100 percent.</v>

2448
01:57:28.761 --> 01:57:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Remember this wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

2449
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:34.660
<v Speaker 3>because he got up and he's in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nigel ben's hitting them again.</v>

2450
01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:36.680
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember him.</v>

2451
01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:38.270
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting how that works,</v>

2452
01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:40.090
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't seen a fight in 20 years and</v>

2453
01:57:40.091 --> 01:57:42.250
<v Speaker 3>you have this stupid memory to have it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head.</v>

2454
01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that upper cut he hit him with.</v>

2455
01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:45.803
<v Speaker 3>So I think this is the end of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think he was a greeley struggling </v>

2456
01:57:50.451 --> 01:57:55.451
<v Speaker 3>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he waited out his whole count.</v>

2457
01:57:57.210 --> 01:57:58.043
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He waited out his whole count on his </v>

2458
01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:03.780
<v Speaker 3>knee and I think some people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical of that at the time.</v>

2459
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:06.560
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2460
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:12.940
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after this fight,</v>

2461
01:58:12.941 --> 01:58:13.774
<v Speaker 3>gerald mcclellan had severe brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>bleeding and was taken to the hospital </v>

2462
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:20.200
<v Speaker 3>and he's never been the same sense.</v>

2463
01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Batman nodule ban was a beast man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were both beasts.</v>

2464
01:58:25.421 --> 01:58:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Gerald mcclellan was a knock out artist </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>

2465
01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you google jeremy mclellan,</v>

2466
01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:32.253
<v Speaker 3>kao highlights the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thought was that it was going to be </v>

2467
01:58:34.570 --> 01:58:37.780
<v Speaker 3>one day joe mcclellen versus Roy Jones </v>
<v Speaker 3>jr.</v>

2468
01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.810
<v Speaker 3>They were going to have a super fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like a big,</v>

2469
01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.813
<v Speaker 3>like one of them pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y'all may weather type fights for that </v>

2470
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:44.741
<v Speaker 3>era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2471
01:58:44.741 --> 01:58:45.730
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got hit hard.</v>

2472
01:58:45.731 --> 01:58:46.564
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ain't hard getting hit in the face like </v>

2473
01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:50.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I remember him getting head?</v>

2474
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm just completely delusional or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that was somewhere in that mix,</v>

2475
01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:59.881
<v Speaker 3>but certainly it was the big bombs from </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcclellan that,</v>

2476
01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.253
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped him in the first round and the </v>

2477
01:59:03.401 --> 01:59:04.234
<v Speaker 3>big bombs from nigel benn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see the first round too </v>

2478
01:59:06.631 --> 01:59:07.464
<v Speaker 3>because from I remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a crazy comeback because nigel </v>

2479
01:59:10.271 --> 01:59:13.000
<v Speaker 3>benn was really hurt and that first </v>
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>

2480
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.863
<v Speaker 3>but just showed insane heart and figured</v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to keep going where a lot of </v>

2481
01:59:18.941 --> 01:59:20.830
<v Speaker 3>people like this fight is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fight is over.</v>

2482
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 3>But you see in those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2483
01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:26.510
<v Speaker 3>highlight reels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a knockout artist man.</v>

2484
01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:28.150
<v Speaker 3>But now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in real,</v>

2485
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:28.871
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

2486
01:59:28.871 --> 01:59:31.360
<v Speaker 3>real bad shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's in a wheelchair.</v>

2487
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:33.610
<v Speaker 3>He from that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2488
01:59:33.630 --> 01:59:35.500
<v Speaker 3>he went blind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2489
01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:36.334
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had severe bleeding on his brain and </v>

2490
01:59:38.681 --> 01:59:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it never really recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could have died in the ring.</v>

2491
01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he absolutely could have died.</v>

2492
01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.100
<v Speaker 3>So here's the first route,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this first round,</v>

2493
01:59:45.130 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 3>insane you're going to with nigel benn </v>
<v Speaker 3>falls through the ropes.</v>

2494
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back a little bit,</v>

2495
01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:53.220
<v Speaker 3>go back a little bit so you could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>how fucking insane this.</v>

2496
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to the beginning of it.</v>

2497
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:57.640
<v Speaker 3>You see how insane this combination is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2498
01:59:57.641 --> 01:59:58.474
<v Speaker 3>mcclellan came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns blazing and hit him with some </v>

2499
02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:03.040
<v Speaker 3>serious bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

2500
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:06.020
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit him with a couple of good shot.</v>

2501
02:00:06.021 --> 02:00:07.300
<v Speaker 3>They're good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hand,</v>

2502
02:00:07.330 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 3>a good lead hook left hook to the body.</v>

2503
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:10.540
<v Speaker 3>So this is the beginning of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking,</v>

2504
02:00:10.541 --> 02:00:13.420
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking over.</v>

2505
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Look at that left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left hook to the body.</v>

2506
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.070
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2507
02:00:17.090 --> 02:00:17.923
<v Speaker 3>I mean mclennan was a destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this and this is when he's </v>

2508
02:00:20.261 --> 02:00:22.720
<v Speaker 3>blasting them through the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2509
02:00:22.721 --> 02:00:25.660
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fight is over.</v>

2510
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Nigel benn comes back from this to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10 rounds later,</v>

2511
02:00:29.591 --> 02:00:31.750
<v Speaker 3>which is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insane.</v>

2512
02:00:32.710 --> 02:00:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean clearly he's hurt.</v>

2513
02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:34.873
<v Speaker 3>He's kinda wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But jeremy mclellan just couldn't keep </v>

2514
02:00:39.191 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 3>this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nigel benn survived and came back.</v>

2515
02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Those are Like mad and tangibles in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

2516
02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:46.593
<v Speaker 3>That's why the best description of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights is always the theater of the </v>

2517
02:00:49.211 --> 02:00:52.690
<v Speaker 3>unknown because you really never know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going to happen.</v>

2518
02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:53.793
<v Speaker 3>When did you get these two world class </v>
<v Speaker 3>knuckle slingers throwing fucking </v>

2519
02:00:58.541 --> 02:01:00.790
<v Speaker 3>haymakers at each of the slickest </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcclellan.</v>

2520
02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.381
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Japan.</v>

2521
02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Comes back with a right and he clenches </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2522
02:01:05.970 --> 02:01:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Mclaughlin starting to get a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>tired,</v>

2523
02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:09.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knees.</v>

2524
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:11.040
<v Speaker 3>They're given up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm to kinda.</v>

2525
02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:12.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's gotta think what kind of </v>

2526
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:13.893
<v Speaker 3>output he's putting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to win this fight and jail </v>

2527
02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 3>son and told me something once that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2528
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.320
<v Speaker 3>an old boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2529
02:01:22.150 --> 02:01:22.983
<v Speaker 3>saying something along the lines of if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to stop a fight and win by </v>

2530
02:01:28.301 --> 02:01:29.134
<v Speaker 3>knockout but fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you almost always lose by decision </v>

2531
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:34.180
<v Speaker 3>because you just blow yourself out so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2532
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's not totally the case </v>
<v Speaker 3>because some people have crazy endurance</v>

2533
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>and they can try to win a fight by </v>
<v Speaker 2>knockout and then recover around later.</v>

2534
02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:45.453
<v Speaker 2>But did the amount of output that you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're throwing everything full </v>

2535
02:01:48.651 --> 02:01:51.530
<v Speaker 2>blast like mcclellan did in that first </v>
<v Speaker 2>round is insane.</v>

2536
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:54.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many punches that up?</v>

2537
02:01:54.610 --> 02:01:56.300
<v Speaker 2>First round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he threw a lot,</v>

2538
02:01:56.301 --> 02:01:57.134
<v Speaker 2>but here's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing a lot of them at full </v>

2539
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:00.764
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so difficult to </v>

2540
02:02:02.331 --> 02:02:03.164
<v Speaker 2>maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What most people don't realize is that </v>

2541
02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:07.700
<v Speaker 2>most of the time we see boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>

2542
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:09.133
<v Speaker 2>they're throwing punches fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're being loose and fluid and </v>

2543
02:02:14.241 --> 02:02:15.074
<v Speaker 2>when they heard a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they expend the most energy </v>

2544
02:02:17.361 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 2>because then they're digging in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drill and blast and they're winding up.</v>

2545
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>They don't normally do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the amount of energy that it takes to</v>

2546
02:02:24.651 --> 02:02:25.484
<v Speaker 2>wind up and throw your hips in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ass into it and all you're </v>

2547
02:02:29.061 --> 02:02:31.610
<v Speaker 2>waiting to explode at the end.</v>

2548
02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:34.820
<v Speaker 2>That's much more than to be just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical boxer.</v>

2549
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:37.910
<v Speaker 2>So when they're throwing technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches and they're moving fast,</v>

2550
02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:39.193
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not exerting the same amount of </v>

2551
02:02:40.461 --> 02:02:41.420
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2552
02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:43.130
<v Speaker 2>when when you're trying to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody out,</v>

2553
02:02:43.131 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 2>like mcclelland clearly wasn't this </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>

2554
02:02:45.230 --> 02:02:49.790
<v Speaker 2>You are running uphill with a weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>sack on your back and you can only do it</v>

2555
02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:52.550
<v Speaker 2>for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as we go into the second round,</v>

2556
02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>like look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see he's already really tired,</v>

2557
02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.373
<v Speaker 2>so it was as much headshot there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was as much his weight cut as it was </v>

2558
02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.193
<v Speaker 2>his strategy to try to win the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>round as it was nigel ben's ability to </v>

2559
02:03:06.681 --> 02:03:11.000
<v Speaker 2>absorb punishment and come back strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>because ben is looking fantastic here in</v>

2560
02:03:11.001 --> 02:03:11.834
<v Speaker 2>the second round look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a big wake up call to a lot </v>

2561
02:03:15.741 --> 02:03:18.710
<v Speaker 2>of boxers that if you engage in wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>brawls,</v>

2562
02:03:18.711 --> 02:03:20.540
<v Speaker 2>even when you were one of the elite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the elite,</v>

2563
02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:24.080
<v Speaker 2>like gerald mcclellan was at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could still get,</v>

2564
02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:26.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain bleeding and be fucked up.</v>

2565
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:29.060
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people attribute that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight cut because he had a,</v>

2566
02:03:29.061 --> 02:03:29.894
<v Speaker 2>he a dehydrate himself quite a bit back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then doing his game plan from his </v>

2567
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get this guy out in the first round.</v>

2568
02:03:35.630 --> 02:03:37.490
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could be that he heard him and he</v>

2569
02:03:37.491 --> 02:03:39.410
<v Speaker 2>figured he could get them out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>

2570
02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.000
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcclellan was a killer.</v>

2571
02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:42.260
<v Speaker 2>THat was his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>

2572
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 2>if he hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was coming after you.</v>

2573
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:47.660
<v Speaker 2>So what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 straight knockouts and 10 were in the</v>

2574
02:03:47.661 --> 02:03:49.590
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

2575
02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:52.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what gerald mcclellan did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it didn't work out against a guy</v>

2576
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:53.714
<v Speaker 2>like nigel benn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nigel benn figured out how to maintain </v>

2577
02:03:55.611 --> 02:03:58.960
<v Speaker 2>his energy better in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

2578
02:03:58.990 --> 02:04:01.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dangerous strategy.</v>

2579
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Empty all your bullets out in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

2580
02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:06.680
<v Speaker 2>He was just on the fence for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>three relevant.</v>

2581
02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:09.350
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2582
02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:12.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what was his success formula up </v>
<v Speaker 2>until then.</v>

2583
02:04:12.650 --> 02:04:13.483
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2584
02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:15.380
<v Speaker 2>that was what was working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

2585
02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:16.970
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work until they don't work </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2586
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>14th street and I called that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2587
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:20.683
<v Speaker 2>I mean do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when we used to think </v>

2588
02:04:21.381 --> 02:04:23.790
<v Speaker 2>that nobody can beat tyson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>

2589
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Do were little when we were young we </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2590
02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did he lose 86?</v>

2591
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 2>did he lose in like 1986 to buster </v>
<v Speaker 2>douglas?</v>

2592
02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year was that?</v>

2593
02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>80 nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 google that.</v>

2594
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moved.</v>

2595
02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:43.580
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it was.</v>

2596
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:44.453
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely doing comedy at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and I definitely saw it with my </v>

2597
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:50.270
<v Speaker 2>friend ron after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2598
02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:51.061
<v Speaker 2>Eleventh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

2599
02:04:51.061 --> 02:04:52.440
<v Speaker 2>90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1990.</v>

2600
02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from that point on,</v>

2601
02:04:56.401 --> 02:04:59.670
<v Speaker 2>we knew he could lose before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every tyson fight like,</v>

2602
02:04:59.671 --> 02:05:01.320
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna bother watching.</v>

2603
02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Why do people want even want to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy just getting killed.</v>

2604
02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:08.570
<v Speaker 2>What were the odds of him when he like </v>
<v Speaker 2>40 to 42 to the one.</v>

2605
02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Somebody got paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody I paid some crazy number.</v>

2606
02:05:11.491 --> 02:05:12.324
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 42.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was one of the highest </v>

2607
02:05:14.071 --> 02:05:15.840
<v Speaker 2>underdogs ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

2608
02:05:16.710 --> 02:05:19.320
<v Speaker 2>40 2:42</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he won by knockout.</v>

2609
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Buster douglas was fantastic back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2610
02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:24.420
<v Speaker 2>You fucked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well dude,</v>

2611
02:05:24.421 --> 02:05:25.254
<v Speaker 2>buster douglas is a crazy example of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who always had a tremendous amount </v>

2612
02:05:28.651 --> 02:05:29.484
<v Speaker 2>of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always regarded as like people </v>

2613
02:05:31.111 --> 02:05:31.944
<v Speaker 2>that were in the know and boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd heard them talk about him and they </v>

2614
02:05:36.901 --> 02:05:37.734
<v Speaker 2>would always talk about how smooth he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in training and when he's at his </v>

2615
02:05:40.711 --> 02:05:43.200
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's literally like a world championship</v>

2616
02:05:43.201 --> 02:05:44.034
<v Speaker 2>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never totally put it together in </v>

2617
02:05:46.301 --> 02:05:48.420
<v Speaker 2>far as far as discipline and training </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

2618
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:49.703
<v Speaker 2>but then his mom died and he decided he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to fuck Mike Tyson up for his </v>

2619
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:54.234
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

2620
02:05:54.930 --> 02:05:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Trained really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard,</v>

2621
02:05:56.461 --> 02:05:59.820
<v Speaker 2>so it was a perfect storm of Mike Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 2>being king of the world.</v>

2622
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:02.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just fucking.</v>

2623
02:06:02.461 --> 02:06:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Everybody up doesn't even feel like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to train anymore.</v>

2624
02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:06.533
<v Speaker 2>He's just just being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just being the world heavyweight </v>

2625
02:06:10.411 --> 02:06:11.340
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

2626
02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:12.233
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they become that guy in </v>

2627
02:06:13.561 --> 02:06:14.394
<v Speaker 2>the first place because they have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to indulge and excess and go </v>

2628
02:06:17.191 --> 02:06:18.024
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's buying tigers and lamborghinis and </v>

2629
02:06:19.951 --> 02:06:24.900
<v Speaker 2>shit and all along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buster douglas fir that fight train like</v>

2630
02:06:24.901 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>a demon and still almost lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still almost lost.</v>

2631
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 2>That's how good tyson was when tyson was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his prime is a knockout artist.</v>

2632
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:37.551
<v Speaker 2>He was so lethal that even though buster</v>
<v Speaker 2>douglas and him fought in bus,</v>

2633
02:06:37.631 --> 02:06:39.540
<v Speaker 2>doug's eventually wind up knocking him </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2634
02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:40.403
<v Speaker 2>He knocked him out after Mike Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked buster douglas down and had him </v>

2635
02:06:43.381 --> 02:06:46.840
<v Speaker 2>hurt and don king after the fight even </v>
<v Speaker 2>protested and said that the,</v>

2636
02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:51.120
<v Speaker 2>the count was more than 10 and that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>buster douglas was down,</v>

2637
02:06:51.150 --> 02:06:51.983
<v Speaker 2>the referee gave him an extra couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds to recover that he shouldn't </v>

2638
02:06:54.271 --> 02:06:55.104
<v Speaker 2>have had.</v>

2639
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I remember that was like a big protest </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the fight,</v>

2640
02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 2>but even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we even with shitty training,</v>

2641
02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:06.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be not taking this guy seriously at all.</v>

2642
02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.673
<v Speaker 2>Even then Mike Tyson still knocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>buster douglas down and almost knocked </v>

2643
02:07:10.471 --> 02:07:11.850
<v Speaker 2>him out with one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2644
02:07:11.851 --> 02:07:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Run tHe locomote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't douglas the longest,</v>

2645
02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:17.520
<v Speaker 2>longest tyson fight ever had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2646
02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I know he's had decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had decisions.</v>

2647
02:07:21.110 --> 02:07:21.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had decision against bone </v>

2648
02:07:22.741 --> 02:07:26.250
<v Speaker 2>crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smith video here as both both knockdowns</v>

2649
02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:27.503
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see like the different 10 </v>

2650
02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.300
<v Speaker 2>counts I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2651
02:07:30.330 --> 02:07:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2652
02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:34.570
<v Speaker 2>He clipped him an upper cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2653
02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:36.090

<v Speaker 3>So look that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Four,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2679
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2680
02:08:32.110 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

2681
02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:36.790
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

2682
02:08:37.150 --> 02:08:38.980
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

2683
02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:41.230
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

2684
02:08:41.650 --> 02:08:43.210
<v Speaker 3>he's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's distracted him.</v>

2685
02:08:43.211 --> 02:08:45.040
<v Speaker 3>A number eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2686
02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Does that stopped the account?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that how that works?</v>

2687
02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.490
<v Speaker 3>As long as a lot of paul's second when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns her running away.</v>

2688
02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight on Mike Tyson here.</v>

2689
02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:56.260
<v Speaker 3>There's five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

2690
02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.000
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

2691
02:08:58.090 --> 02:08:59.550
<v Speaker 3>Just like none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real quick.</v>

2692
02:08:59.650 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2693
02:09:01.121 --> 02:09:03.010
<v Speaker 3>that guy's way quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the same guy?</v>

2694
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

2695
02:09:04.961 --> 02:09:05.794
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You suck at counting in spanish and </v>

2696
02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:13.750
<v Speaker 3>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking crazy hard job,</v>

2697
02:09:13.751 --> 02:09:15.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the middle of the moment.</v>

2698
02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:18.640
<v Speaker 3>You know there's all this hype going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pay the fuck out.</v>

2699
02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same guy because a,</v>

2700
02:09:21.850 --> 02:09:24.060
<v Speaker 3>it's the same fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>

2701
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:25.223
<v Speaker 3>how does the same guy count?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real slow for buster douglas and way </v>

2702
02:09:29.861 --> 02:09:30.694
<v Speaker 3>faster for Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A description of the video says this </v>

2703
02:09:32.741 --> 02:09:35.740
<v Speaker 3>clearly demonstrates that he gave them </v>
<v Speaker 3>both the exact same amount of time.</v>

2704
02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2705
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:39.670
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I thought was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's try that again.</v>

2706
02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:40.923
<v Speaker 3>Let's try that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's count for tyson will count for </v>

2707
02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:46.690
<v Speaker 3>tyson first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready tyson goes down.</v>

2708
02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a combination.</v>

2709
02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Plus two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>3:00,</v>

2710
02:09:50.890 --> 02:09:52.450
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2711
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:54.280
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2712
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.530
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

2713
02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:58.660
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>11,</v>

2714
02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.850
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13,</v>

2715
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.013
<v Speaker 3>14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got knocked down a run around 50 on </v>

2716
02:10:03.251 --> 02:10:03.971
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the clock.</v>

2717
02:10:03.971 --> 02:10:05.770
<v Speaker 3>On the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see it in.</v>

2718
02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:06.633
<v Speaker 3>How many seconds was it a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts them up at 38 is when he knocks </v>

2719
02:10:10.281 --> 02:10:12.290
<v Speaker 3>on the track right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2720
02:10:12.610 --> 02:10:14.800
<v Speaker 3>She's like 13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2721
02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:18.160
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2722
02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.530
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2723
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:22.570
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>

2724
02:10:22.930 --> 02:10:23.763
<v Speaker 3>They're both out both out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do the counting is definitely slower on </v>

2725
02:10:30.191 --> 02:10:32.500
<v Speaker 3>buster douglas with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're definitely both out,</v>

2726
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 3>but either</v>

2727
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.780
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said seven,</v>

2728
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I bet butts in instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2729
02:10:37.890 --> 02:10:41.090
<v Speaker 2>for if you've sped the count up by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>

2730
02:10:41.091 --> 02:10:43.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't think buster douglas could've </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten up quicker.</v>

2731
02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I bet he could have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was waiting for the guy to hit</v>

2732
02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.290
<v Speaker 2>eight so he stands up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2733
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Which what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take as much time as you can,</v>

2734
02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:53.030
<v Speaker 2>especially after you got legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt like that.</v>

2735
02:10:53.031 --> 02:10:56.180
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is like,</v>

2736
02:10:56.210 --> 02:10:57.043
<v Speaker 2>would he have been able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the guide countered a little quicker </v>

2737
02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:03.050
<v Speaker 2>and eight came where seven was or six </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2738
02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:03.913
<v Speaker 2>would have been able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he probabLy would have the </v>

2739
02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:06.494
<v Speaker 2>questions would have tyson and been able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to him with one punch before the </v>

2740
02:11:09.051 --> 02:11:10.880
<v Speaker 2>bell that might have knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:11.900
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2742
02:11:11.901 --> 02:11:12.734
<v Speaker 2>Fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get them back up again and it's </v>

2743
02:11:14.031 --> 02:11:15.550
<v Speaker 2>three extra seconds at tyson.</v>

2744
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Storms forward and connects with it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>head shots with a faithful dude.</v>

2745
02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Crazy shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this guy right here.</v>

2746
02:11:21.921 --> 02:11:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Watch the fight glove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the official counters?</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

2761
02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:58.333
<v Speaker 2>That was an insane fight though because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't believe Mike Tyson could </v>

2762
02:12:00.831 --> 02:12:01.970
<v Speaker 2>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when I watched it.</v>

2763
02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.073
<v Speaker 2>I remember I heard about it first and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I watched it and they still </v>

2764
02:12:05.781 --> 02:12:08.050
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe what I'm watching.</v>

2765
02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.470
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get up and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock this dude out for sure.</v>

2766
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Believe you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2767
02:12:11.931 --> 02:12:12.764
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you couldn't believe that he could </v>

2768
02:12:13.881 --> 02:12:16.790
<v Speaker 2>lose who that's people don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2769
02:12:16.791 --> 02:12:17.624
<v Speaker 2>There's never been someone that was as </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant for as like a scary moment in </v>

2770
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:24.223
<v Speaker 2>boxing history than Mike Tyson because </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you knew Roy Jones is gonna </v>

2771
02:12:27.631 --> 02:12:30.370
<v Speaker 2>fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoeveR he found the way he was going to</v>

2772
02:12:30.371 --> 02:12:32.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he knocked him out with one punch.</v>

2773
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:37.570
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't going to be this horrific </v>
<v Speaker 2>storming by destroyer,</v>

2774
02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:41.630
<v Speaker 2>just common after your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy jones had box your face off,</v>

2775
02:12:41.631 --> 02:12:46.430
<v Speaker 2>hit you with the lead left hooks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight right hands that are way faster</v>

2776
02:12:46.431 --> 02:12:48.680
<v Speaker 2>than anything you can duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would fuck people up,</v>

2777
02:12:48.681 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>but he fucked people up with a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>style and movement and speed.</v>

2778
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Whereas tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just mugging you at the same time,</v>

2779
02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like all anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fast hood and you end.</v>

2780
02:13:00.690 --> 02:13:03.770
<v Speaker 2>He was solid like sledgehammer 220 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

2781
02:13:03.771 --> 02:13:07.400
<v Speaker 2>but moved like 160 pound guy like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't believe it at the time.</v>

2782
02:13:08.250 --> 02:13:10.250
<v Speaker 2>They had never been a heavyweight like </v>
<v Speaker 2>him before.</v>

2783
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:11.263
<v Speaker 2>There was heavyweights that that moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing like ali ali had the most </v>

2784
02:13:14.421 --> 02:13:15.254
<v Speaker 2>amazing footwork of anybody just smooth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and flowing and change what the game </v>

2785
02:13:19.401 --> 02:13:20.840
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in front of people.</v>

2786
02:13:21.010 --> 02:13:21.843
<v Speaker 2>The ropeadope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a crazy video of volley that </v>

2787
02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:25.373
<v Speaker 2>someone had on their instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those boxing pages where he's </v>

2788
02:13:29.091 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 2>fighting someone and the guy throws two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

2789
02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:34.950
<v Speaker 2>four punches in a row and ali's got his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands down.</v>

2790
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I just barely moving his head away with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each punch.</v>

2791
02:13:37.890 --> 02:13:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Just like pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't hit me.</v>

2792
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:40.463
<v Speaker 2>He just had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a magic about what he was </v>

2793
02:13:42.811 --> 02:13:43.644
<v Speaker 2>doing that you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is a heavyweight moving like that </v>

2794
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 2>tyson jab to tyson was a totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different kind of strategy,</v>

2795
02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:51.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those,</v>

2796
02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.910
<v Speaker 2>those strategies will be argued to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of time.</v>

2797
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Like what would have happened if Mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson had a thought,</v>

2798
02:13:56.671 --> 02:13:58.620
<v Speaker 2>muhammad ali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in their primes.</v>

2799
02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:00.480
<v Speaker 2>What would have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2800
02:14:00.481 --> 02:14:02.970
<v Speaker 2>what have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have been fucking crazy.</v>

2801
02:14:02.971 --> 02:14:03.804
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that if we had Mike Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his very best before shit went </v>

2802
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.680
<v Speaker 2>completely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started giving out rolls royces.</v>

2803
02:14:10.681 --> 02:14:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Two cops walking around with his tiger </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his underwear before all that stuff.</v>

2804
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2805
02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:18.480
<v Speaker 2>before for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before bite nears.</v>

2806
02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:22.430
<v Speaker 2>The bioneers thing was when amanda was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2807
02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:25.080
<v Speaker 2>when a van or beat him in that first </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

2808
02:14:25.110 --> 02:14:27.210
<v Speaker 2>no one could believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one could believe it.</v>

2809
02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Even though tyson did last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buster douglas,</v>

2810
02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.353
<v Speaker 2>everybody assumed that tyson last </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he hadn't been training and he </v>

2811
02:14:32.551 --> 02:14:35.730
<v Speaker 2>really hadn't been been focused and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he went to jail,</v>

2812
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 2>came out of jail and he looked jacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>member way more jacked.</v>

2813
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Hit a ridiculous six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that shit to another phase son.</v>

2814
02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Now he got the tattoo on his face </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>

2815
02:14:46.561 --> 02:14:50.760
<v Speaker 2>right after jail I think at the tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On his face.</v>

2816
02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:52.243
<v Speaker 2>Angel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2817
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:56.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had mild tattooed on his arm.</v>

2818
02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:00.200
<v Speaker 2>What does it say here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike tyson opens up.</v>

2819

02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:11.660
<v Speaker 2>We saw micky ward box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

2863
02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>some famous dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he bought some old,</v>

2864
02:17:16.010 --> 02:17:16.843
<v Speaker 2>some old time to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy just told me about this recently </v>

2865
02:17:18.981 --> 02:17:20.060
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forgot what it was,</v>

2866
02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:24.770
<v Speaker 2>but we were both like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't have been more than like 19,</v>

2867
02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:25.873
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to see micky ward box was crazy </v>

2868
02:17:28.971 --> 02:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to see live boxing.</v>

2869
02:17:30.531 --> 02:17:34.700
<v Speaker 2>So weird because there's no commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd only seen it at home.</v>

2870
02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see a live boxing match?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2871
02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It's oddly quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2872
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:45.730
<v Speaker 2>What does it say greg young that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought in 95,</v>

2873
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>85.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2874
02:17:48.081 --> 02:17:50.630
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably exactly it.</v>

2875
02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.760
<v Speaker 2>That means I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2876
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:55.970
<v Speaker 2>yup.</v>

2878
02:17:57.201 --> 02:18:00.380

<v Speaker 2>I guess it was this guy greg young.</v>

2879
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Why did I think it was an older guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple more right here,</v>

2880
02:18:02.991 --> 02:18:05.150

<v Speaker 2>so somebody owns it.</v>

3322
02:38:05.930 --> 02:38:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Somebody bought it because I think I </v>
<v Speaker 2>traded it in when I got something else,</v>

3323
02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:14.330
<v Speaker 2>but it was a joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for modeling it to perfection.</v>

3324
02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:17.180
<v Speaker 2>That guy's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my car to this day.</v>

3325
02:38:17.181 --> 02:38:18.480
<v Speaker 2>That was one of my all time favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

3326
02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not the fastest car ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove,</v>

3327
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:21.523
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't about being fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about like the experience of </v>

3328
02:38:26.181 --> 02:38:28.190
<v Speaker 2>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was More real.</v>

3329
02:38:28.191 --> 02:38:29.024
<v Speaker 2>Tactile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very light car and it's a mid </v>

3330
02:38:30.891 --> 02:38:35.090
<v Speaker 2>engine car seats with low right bucket </v>
<v Speaker 2>sEats and it's a japanese car.</v>

3331
02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a honda so you know it's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to break.</v>

3332
02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I never had a problem with those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had two of them.</v>

3333
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.983
<v Speaker 2>I had one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had it for like three years when I </v>

3334
02:38:42.861 --> 02:38:45.020
<v Speaker 2>traded it in and then I got this other </v>
<v Speaker 2>one later,</v>

3335
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but in between I had a porsche and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit broke down constantly.</v>

3336
02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I had a 99,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 or nine,</v>

3337
02:38:50.931 --> 02:38:51.980
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six turbo,</v>

3338
02:38:51.981 --> 02:38:56.570
<v Speaker 2>which is like two thouSand two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit broke constantly.</v>

3339
02:38:57.020 --> 02:38:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It just kept breaking man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of crazy shit.</v>

3340
02:38:59.571 --> 02:39:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Like the shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>linkage blue,</v>

3341
02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:01.544
<v Speaker 2>two separate times where I would go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift gears and it just disengaged and </v>

3342
02:39:05.421 --> 02:39:08.990
<v Speaker 2>was floating around on two separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasions that happened where I couldn't</v>

3343
02:39:08.991 --> 02:39:09.824
<v Speaker 2>shift gears and I was stuck one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily it happened while I was driving </v>

3344
02:39:12.471 --> 02:39:13.304
<v Speaker 2>down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was driving down the road and it </v>

3345
02:39:14.631 --> 02:39:16.910
<v Speaker 2>popped loose and I was in second gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3346
02:39:16.911 --> 02:39:18.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wind this bitch out and get</v>

3347
02:39:18.801 --> 02:39:21.430
<v Speaker 2>to the porsche dealership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kept in second gear,</v>

3348
02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:24.500
<v Speaker 2>just drove around and second gear </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the streets,</v>

3349
02:39:24.501 --> 02:39:27.140
<v Speaker 2>like near ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

3350
02:39:27.470 --> 02:39:29.890
<v Speaker 2>They just weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't durable bathroom.</v>

3351
02:39:29.940 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 2>That porch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the new one.</v>

3352
02:39:31.401 --> 02:39:33.980
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>

3353
02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't really into driving fast.</v>

3354
02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:38.150
<v Speaker 2>What I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I like is a car that corners really</v>

3355
02:39:38.151 --> 02:39:39.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3356
02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I like a car like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just it has a connection to the road,</v>

3357
02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:43.910
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

3358
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:46.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the new nsx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit looks preposterous.</v>

3359
02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:51.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a preposterous looking vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 2>like knight rider.</v>

3360
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:51.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With.</v>

3361
02:39:51.801 --> 02:39:55.070
<v Speaker 2>The only problem I have with this car is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem I have with all these cars,</v>

3362
02:39:55.071 --> 02:39:56.200
<v Speaker 2>they won't let you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3363
02:39:56.450 --> 02:39:57.283
<v Speaker 2>use a manual transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't sell them with a manual </v>

3364
02:39:59.361 --> 02:40:02.120
<v Speaker 2>transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is,</v>

3365
02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.680
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not racing like I want.</v>

3366
02:40:04.690 --> 02:40:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I want it to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it feels people need to remember</v>

3367
02:40:08.751 --> 02:40:11.690
<v Speaker 2>how much better it feels to drive a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manual transmission.</v>

3368
02:40:11.691 --> 02:40:15.320
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to not learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since a lot of people don't know,</v>

3369
02:40:15.321 --> 02:40:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I never learned that's the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to stall out and</v>

3370
02:40:18.481 --> 02:40:19.140
<v Speaker 2>look like an asshole.</v>

3371
02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:21.610
<v Speaker 2>That's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you learn how to Drive,</v>

3372
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:23.430
<v Speaker 2>he's still stalled out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stall out occasionally.</v>

3373
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:24.473
<v Speaker 2>But the fund that you have with a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that with a manual transmission is </v>

3374
02:40:28.471 --> 02:40:30.450
<v Speaker 2>so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're engaged,</v>

3375
02:40:30.451 --> 02:40:34.320
<v Speaker 2>you're shifting things first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3376
02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:38.160
<v Speaker 2>there's something cool about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for whatever reason,</v>

3377
02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:41.040
<v Speaker 2>people are forgetting that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different experience.</v>

3378
02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:42.113
<v Speaker 2>when you drive a car that has a manual </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmission versus a car that's not a </v>

3379
02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:45.930
<v Speaker 2>magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>more control,</v>

3380
02:40:45.931 --> 02:40:46.764
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3381
02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:48.420
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

3382
02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.560
<v Speaker 2>you're better off with the automatic if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be totally honest.</v>

3383
02:40:52.770 --> 02:40:53.603
<v Speaker 2>The automatic is going to go faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have a better choice of </v>

3384
02:40:56.431 --> 02:40:57.264
<v Speaker 2>gear selection than you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to like like a lot of times </v>

3385
02:40:59.671 --> 02:41:02.230
<v Speaker 2>when these race car drivers to take like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an automatic porsche,</v>

3386
02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:04.440
<v Speaker 2>like one of the new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take it on track.</v>

3387
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>They don't even take it out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatic.</v>

3388
02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:09.360
<v Speaker 2>They don't shift the gears themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a double clutch gearbox,</v>

3389
02:41:09.361 --> 02:41:10.194
<v Speaker 2>they put it in drive and they just go </v>
<v Speaker 2>because things are so good at picking </v>

3390
02:41:13.201 --> 02:41:14.940
<v Speaker 2>the right gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why fuck around,</v>

3391
02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:17.850
<v Speaker 2>so it's better that way really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3392
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:19.680
<v Speaker 2>You have more control of the car that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3393
02:41:20.190 --> 02:41:21.023
<v Speaker 2>but that's not necessarily what makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most fun than what makes the most </v>

3394
02:41:25.141 --> 02:41:27.960
<v Speaker 2>fun is you're engaged in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're shifting the gears,</v>

3395
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:29.430
<v Speaker 2>but smooth car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3396
02:41:29.610 --> 02:41:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3397
02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:32.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3398
02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:37.200
<v Speaker 2>He could learn how to drive a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard.</v>

3399
02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I did it one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy taught me in rehab.</v>

3400
02:41:40.050 --> 02:41:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Huddah hood drivers take shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going downhill though.</v>

3401
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uphill and it was the worst,</v>

3402
02:41:48.671 --> 02:41:49.504
<v Speaker 2>the top of los anica you get to the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>of laci and you're right when you get </v>

3403
02:41:51.361 --> 02:41:53.550
<v Speaker 2>the sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a super steep hill.</v>

3404
02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have an outbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the new ones they don't have.</v>

3405
02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:58.590
<v Speaker 2>He breaks the new ones have a bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>button,</v>

3406
02:41:58.591 --> 02:41:59.424
<v Speaker 2>e-brake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'd have a handle that you just </v>

3407
02:42:00.691 --> 02:42:03.930
<v Speaker 2>lift up and lift down those nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fix that.</v>

3408
02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're stuck in,</v>

3409
02:42:05.821 --> 02:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>unlike san francisco street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

3410
02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:11.100
<v Speaker 2>and need a red light and you got to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward and in a stick shift.</v>

3411
02:42:11.101 --> 02:42:11.934
<v Speaker 2>That shit isn't heart attack inducing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always afraid of rolling back on </v>

3412
02:42:15.501 --> 02:42:15.880
<v Speaker 2>that car.</v>

3413
02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3414
02:42:16.890 --> 02:42:17.723
<v Speaker 2>you have to have an emergency brake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to do when you're a young kid </v>

3415
02:42:21.481 --> 02:42:22.314
<v Speaker 2>and you're learning how to drive one and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want a crazy steep hill at the top </v>

3416
02:42:24.691 --> 02:42:26.250
<v Speaker 2>of the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a stopLight like,</v>

3417
02:42:26.310 --> 02:42:29.190
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's designed for automatic cars.</v>

3418
02:42:30.810 --> 02:42:33.890
<v Speaker 2>If you have a stick shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking pain in the ass,</v>

3419
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:36.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even read a motorcycle.</v>

3420
02:42:37.260 --> 02:42:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Motorcycle stall out too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3421
02:42:38.610 --> 02:42:39.443
<v Speaker 2>Same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most motorcycle guys would probably </v>

3422
02:42:41.461 --> 02:42:43.470
<v Speaker 2>be able to transition to a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty easy,</v>

3423
02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:46.950
<v Speaker 2>pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a neutral.</v>

3424
02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3425
02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I never wrote him a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took some classes for a little bit.</v>

3426
02:42:51.540 --> 02:42:52.373
<v Speaker 2>But then while I was taking classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of people I knew wiped out </v>

3427
02:42:54.541 --> 02:42:55.530
<v Speaker 2>pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3428
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:57.930
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too dangerous.</v>

3429
02:42:58.670 --> 02:43:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Ceo wrote a mini bike one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3430
02:43:01.330 --> 02:43:04.680
<v Speaker 2>where were they in san jose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This comedian named butch.</v>

3431
02:43:05.210 --> 02:43:07.500
<v Speaker 2>He let me ride it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many bucks.</v>

3432
02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone without too much power.</v>

3433
02:43:10.290 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when you get into</v>

3434

<v Speaker 3>goes zero to 60 in a second.</v>

3436
02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:21.220
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just sell that to somebody.</v>

3437
02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:23.080

3441
02:43:35.170 --> 02:43:37.340

02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.903
<v Speaker 3>Within the last hundred years we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that you could do that with </v>

3480
02:45:29.010 --> 02:45:33.460

3482
02:45:36.671 --> 02:45:37.504
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if something jumps out in front of </v>

<v Speaker 3>wouldn't want to just go,</v>

3486
02:45:48.761 --> 02:45:51.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run when he comes by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I see them,</v>

3487
02:45:51.370 --> 02:45:52.203
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to run and I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the work and then he tries to </v>

3488
02:45:54.791 --> 02:45:58.960
<v Speaker 3>correct for you and wipes out there.</v>

3490
02:46:04.431 --> 02:46:07.520

3493
02:46:14.421 --> 02:46:15.254
<v Speaker 2>heightened your senses have to be to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to stay on top of this where </v>

3499
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:38.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a video in real time with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>all going over this hill.</v>

3500
02:46:38.511 --> 02:46:39.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>

3501
02:46:39.201 --> 02:46:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Like zoom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really get a sense of it right there</v>

3502
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:47.030
<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're riding in the pov there pov,</v>

3503
02:46:47.031 --> 02:46:47.864
<v Speaker 2>you get a little bit of a sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really get a sense of it when </v>

3504
02:46:50.001 --> 02:46:52.550
<v Speaker 2>you watch them pass by stationary </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras.</v>

3505
02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:54.020
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guYs are.</v>

3506
02:46:54.090 --> 02:46:54.923
<v Speaker 2>My cousins sort of like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they like crazy people that </v>

3507
02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:58.400
<v Speaker 2>pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter pilots,</v>

3508
02:46:58.440 --> 02:46:59.300
<v Speaker 2>guys that go.</v>

3509
02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:02.480
<v Speaker 2>There are risk taken fools man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3510
02:47:02.481 --> 02:47:04.250
<v Speaker 2>this is just like what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3511
02:47:04.310 --> 02:47:07.550
<v Speaker 2>what those strong men dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the peOple that are.</v>

3512
02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:08.473
<v Speaker 2>They're hard Wired to do incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous things and I guarantee you </v>

3513
02:47:12.531 --> 02:47:15.770
<v Speaker 2>these same people that are hardwired to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do these kinds of dangerous,</v>

3514
02:47:15.771 --> 02:47:16.604
<v Speaker 2>risky things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would be like special forces </v>

3515
02:47:18.711 --> 02:47:21.020
<v Speaker 2>operators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would be navy seals.</v>

3516
02:47:21.021 --> 02:47:21.854
<v Speaker 2>They would be either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would be people that are most </v>

3517
02:47:23.631 --> 02:47:24.261
<v Speaker 2>scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3518
02:47:24.261 --> 02:47:25.094
<v Speaker 2>They can do things that other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably don't have the nerves for and </v>

3519
02:47:29.811 --> 02:47:30.644
<v Speaker 2>they're thrill seekers like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you could take a thrIll seeker </v>

3520
02:47:33.351 --> 02:47:37.010
<v Speaker 2>that maybe would have joined the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military and put a meal on a bike or put</v>

3521
02:47:37.011 --> 02:47:37.844
<v Speaker 2>them In an mma cage or put them in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing ring and you get that same type </v>

3522
02:47:41.931 --> 02:47:42.764
<v Speaker 2>of person like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people all exist because you </v>

3523
02:47:45.591 --> 02:47:46.910
<v Speaker 2>needed those traits.</v>

3524
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:49.340
<v Speaker 2>You needed those traits in order to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

3525
02:47:49.341 --> 02:47:52.340
<v Speaker 2>to keep your civilization alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed big,</v>

3526
02:47:52.341 --> 02:47:53.840
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murderous people.</v>

3527
02:47:53.841 --> 02:47:56.420
<v Speaker 2>You need people that were crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't afraid of danger.</v>

3528
02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:59.360
<v Speaker 2>You need a risk takers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to reward seekers.</v>

3529
02:47:59.361 --> 02:48:03.320
<v Speaker 2>You needed people who wanted to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>king and if you didn't have that,</v>

3530
02:48:03.321 --> 02:48:04.154
<v Speaker 2>you weren't going to survive because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other people that had that on </v>

3531
02:48:05.391 --> 02:48:06.224
<v Speaker 2>the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's crazy is we're figuring </v>

3532
02:48:07.941 --> 02:48:08.774
<v Speaker 2>out how to filter that shit into sports </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and all sorts of other aspects of </v>

3533
02:48:12.501 --> 02:48:13.334
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's these same instincts that have </v>

3534
02:48:14.391 --> 02:48:15.224
<v Speaker 2>been around for hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years that have turned people into what </v>

3535
02:48:18.081 --> 02:48:20.730
<v Speaker 2>they are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

3536
02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:24.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a trip really as a trip when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about people,</v>

3537
02:48:24.591 --> 02:48:26.210
<v Speaker 2>just people in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

3538
02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:27.313
<v Speaker 2>The paths that people take to become who</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are right now to be this guy on a </v>

3539
02:48:31.341 --> 02:48:33.950
<v Speaker 2>jet pack going 100 miles an hour down a </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

3540
02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:36.340
<v Speaker 2>How fast is he going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delivery.</v>

3541
02:48:36.350 --> 02:48:38.040
<v Speaker 2>We'd very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fast.</v>

3542
02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3543
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's flying.</v>

3544
02:48:41.690 --> 02:48:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one,</v>

3545
02:48:44.871 --> 02:48:46.790
<v Speaker 2>but this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the fastest one.</v>

3546
02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:47.773
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're going to get hummingbird,</v>

3561
02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:29.124
<v Speaker 2>that would put like glowing lights on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that would cause people to have </v>

3562
02:49:30.841 --> 02:49:32.370
<v Speaker 2>seizures.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Burning man hummingbird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glowing flashing light wings.</v>

3567
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:49.770
<v Speaker 2>That'd be bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3568
02:49:49.771 --> 02:49:50.601
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burning man.</v>

3569
02:49:50.601 --> 02:49:55.100
<v Speaker 2>This artist wants to cover burning man </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a massive nasa engineered blanket.</v>

3570
02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:58.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>square or it.</v>

3571
02:49:58.830 --> 02:50:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 square meters.</v>

3572
02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:02.750
<v Speaker 2>For what to trip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fall.</v>

3573
02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:03.613
<v Speaker 2>What would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to reflect 97 percent of </v>

3574
02:50:05.421 --> 02:50:06.830
<v Speaker 2>the heat that would normally stay down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3575
02:50:06.831 --> 02:50:09.330
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to do a portion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're going to take.</v>

3576
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Obviously can't cover that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

3577
02:50:10.610 --> 02:50:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I was just reading about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you to take one of those space</v>

3578
02:50:13.191 --> 02:50:15.170
<v Speaker 2>blankets with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going hiking in the woods,</v>

3579
02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you go on a camping trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3580
02:50:17.650 --> 02:50:20.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have like some survival stuff,</v>

3581
02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:22.250
<v Speaker 2>a survival kit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they say is to get one</v>

3582
02:50:22.251 --> 02:50:23.084
<v Speaker 2>of those because you build a fire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get under the blanket in the </v>

3583
02:50:27.051 --> 02:50:31.190
<v Speaker 2>fire and the fire reflects off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blanket and it makes a big impact on the</v>

3584
02:50:31.191 --> 02:50:35.420
<v Speaker 2>amount of heat it gives off and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think like for survival purposes,</v>

3585
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:40.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a good move to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did I,</v>

3586
02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:44.780
<v Speaker 2>where did I hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About a think I heard that on a podcast</v>

3587
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:50.760
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out which podcast it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

3588
02:50:50.761 --> 02:50:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the um,</v>

3589
02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:57.920
<v Speaker 2>those little tiny blankets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't weigh anything either.</v>

3590
02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a smart thing for people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry around with,</v>

3591
02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:05.200
<v Speaker 2>through the qbr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warm supposedly never seen one warmer,</v>

3592
02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but they're really good apparently for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3593
02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:11.010
<v Speaker 2>for reflecting heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they can keep your body heat in,</v>

3594
02:51:12.130 --> 02:51:12.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3595
02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:15.620
<v Speaker 2>and pretty effective compared to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>size and weight,</v>

3596
02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:16.793
<v Speaker 2>just like we're legit when they wrap </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around the chipotle burritos to </v>

3597
02:51:20.001 --> 02:51:21.300
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they do.</v>

3598
02:51:21.700 --> 02:51:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Looks like there's nothing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that's why chipotle,</v>

3599
02:51:24.271 --> 02:51:28.990
<v Speaker 2>he uses those wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got food.</v>

3600
02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Poison that you pull it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you did in dc,</v>

3601
02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:33.833
<v Speaker 2>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly where he got the food </v>

3602
02:51:34.731 --> 02:51:37.880
<v Speaker 2>poisoning of the last thing I ate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3603
02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.133
<v Speaker 2>And then how much time did it take </v>
<v Speaker 2>between eating and you're getting food </v>

3604
02:51:41.871 --> 02:51:42.920
<v Speaker 2>poisoning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hour,</v>

3605
02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:46.130
<v Speaker 2>one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like I felt like getting hot.</v>

3606
02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Then I just threw up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before that,</v>

3607
02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:50.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one hour.</v>

3608
02:51:50.571 --> 02:51:55.571
<v Speaker 2>What did you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you eat anything else earlier?</v>

3609
02:51:56.840 --> 02:51:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3610
02:51:58.510 --> 02:52:01.880
<v Speaker 2>it was the plane eight hours before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food poisoning kicked in.</v>

3611
02:52:02.300 --> 02:52:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe three,</v>

3612
02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:05.380
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fly with hours.</v>

3613
02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's what I think most </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts have never talked to.</v>

3614
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.863
<v Speaker 2>Food poisoning expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bullshit you because I </v>

3615
02:52:13.301 --> 02:52:14.134
<v Speaker 2>think most people will say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely that it was the food that </v>

3616
02:52:16.781 --> 02:52:19.390
<v Speaker 2>was on the plane that got you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you get in a plane?</v>

3617
02:52:19.570 --> 02:52:19.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't,</v>

3618
02:52:19.901 --> 02:52:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>latin fireproof,</v>

3619
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:22.060
<v Speaker 2>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're nuts.</v>

3620
02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:23.793
<v Speaker 2>You might have gotten it from nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sure it was food poisoning and not </v>

3621
02:52:25.751 --> 02:52:27.730
<v Speaker 2>just like stomach flu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

3622
02:52:27.731 --> 02:52:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but it was bad for like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost 14 pounds,</v>

3623
02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever people say I got food poisoning</v>

3624
02:52:32.201 --> 02:52:33.760
<v Speaker 2>from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always go.</v>

3625
02:52:33.761 --> 02:52:38.050
<v Speaker 2>You might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean people don't know how long it</v>

3626
02:52:38.051 --> 02:52:40.470
<v Speaker 2>takes to get food poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'S a little chicken.</v>

3627
02:52:41.130 --> 02:52:42.040
<v Speaker 2>it was chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

3628
02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.233
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many hours does it take before food </v>

3629
02:52:44.081 --> 02:52:45.250
<v Speaker 2>wasn't chose that one to three.</v>

3630
02:52:45.370 --> 02:52:45.671
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

3631
02:52:45.671 --> 02:52:46.151
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3632
02:52:46.151 --> 02:52:48.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one of the cerner had dirty hands.</v>

3633
02:52:48.970 --> 02:52:51.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they used to think it was longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they used to think it was longer?</v>

3634
02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Because I used to hear that it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours.</v>

3635
02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I thought you had to wait for it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>digest,</v>

3636
02:52:55.271 --> 02:52:57.340
<v Speaker 2>but you Can eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

3637
02:52:57.341 --> 02:52:58.174
<v Speaker 2>Then probably wester polar then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would say if you had eaten three </v>

3638
02:53:01.781 --> 02:53:03.260
<v Speaker 2>hours earlier and then right after she </v>
<v Speaker 2>went.</v>

3639
02:53:03.261 --> 02:53:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're saying one,</v>

3640
02:53:04.931 --> 02:53:05.321
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

3641
02:53:05.321 --> 02:53:06.670
<v Speaker 2>one is one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends what it is,</v>

3642
02:53:06.671 --> 02:53:11.671
<v Speaker 2>I suppose to roast chicken or clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>

3643
02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:15.500
<v Speaker 2>People get that from salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3644
02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:16.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run off man's runoff from the animal </v>

3645
02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:21.940
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animal shit essentially.</v>

3646
02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times when they have these,</v>

3647
02:53:25.301 --> 02:53:27.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these farms,</v>

3648
02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:28.773
<v Speaker 2>you'll get it rains and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>runoff and the runoff is carrying cow </v>

3649
02:53:32.141 --> 02:53:32.974
<v Speaker 2>shit and pig shit and it's getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and it's getting onto plants </v>

3650
02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:42.520
<v Speaker 2>and if they don't adequately wash these </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants and you get them and you eat them</v>

3651
02:53:42.521 --> 02:53:44.620
<v Speaker 2>raw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely get sick.</v>

3652
02:53:45.030 --> 02:53:45.863
<v Speaker 2>See what google that eco lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the cause of eco lie in </v>

3653
02:53:49.781 --> 02:53:50.614
<v Speaker 2>vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm preTty sure that's the reason </v>

3654
02:53:53.020 --> 02:53:54.970
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you want to drive to,</v>

3655
02:53:54.971 --> 02:53:59.230
<v Speaker 2>like when I do show them by salary or </v>
<v Speaker 2>bakersfield on the right hand side,</v>

3656
02:53:59.231 --> 02:54:00.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pass by um,</v>

3657
02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:02.290
<v Speaker 2>these cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3658
02:54:02.310 --> 02:54:04.570
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a lake and I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that was water,</v>

3659
02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:06.033
<v Speaker 2>but it was brought off a lake and lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole lake full of culture just </v>

3660
02:54:11.651 --> 02:54:13.390
<v Speaker 2>didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so dark.</v>

3661
02:54:14.290 --> 02:54:15.520
<v Speaker 2>there's a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill a pig,</v>

3662
02:54:15.521 --> 02:54:20.290
<v Speaker 2>shit outside this one pig farm on of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those factory farms that where they have</v>

3663
02:54:20.291 --> 02:54:21.124
<v Speaker 2>these warehouses filled with pigs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they flew over with a drone to get </v>

3664
02:54:23.921 --> 02:54:24.754
<v Speaker 2>footage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see This putrid disgusting body </v>

3665
02:54:29.471 --> 02:54:32.590
<v Speaker 2>of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just shit and piss and mean.</v>

3666
02:54:32.591 --> 02:54:34.870
<v Speaker 2>It's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's massive.</v>

3667
02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like a lake that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you'd go fishing in the end.</v>

3668
02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Where are we going to put all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>

3669
02:54:41.650 --> 02:54:42.311
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3670
02:54:42.311 --> 02:54:45.610
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not supposed to do that.</v>

3671
02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:46.833
<v Speaker 2>You know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing of figuring out how to make </v>

3672
02:54:48.731 --> 02:54:53.470
<v Speaker 2>the most amount of money with having the</v>
<v Speaker 2>least amount of concerns for the life of</v>

3673
02:54:53.471 --> 02:54:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the animal is the total wrong way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>

3674
02:54:56.440 --> 02:54:57.273
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're feeding 20 million </v>

3675
02:54:59.471 --> 02:55:01.780
<v Speaker 2>people and none of those people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of where their food comes,</v>

3676
02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:02.793
<v Speaker 2>people start making based on money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>profit and then you get to this point </v>

3677
02:55:05.631 --> 02:55:08.900
<v Speaker 2>where someone allows them to where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't agree on what should and shouldn't</v>

3678
02:55:08.901 --> 02:55:09.734
<v Speaker 2>be done or we don't agree on what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should and shouldn't have force in </v>

3679
02:55:12.050 --> 02:55:12.883
<v Speaker 2>force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we get to this place where you </v>

3680
02:55:14.091 --> 02:55:14.924
<v Speaker 2>have these buildings that are filled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with pigs and you've got a lake of piss </v>

3681
02:55:17.351 --> 02:55:19.560
<v Speaker 2>and shit behind it and these things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>jammed,</v>

3682
02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:21.980
<v Speaker 2>these cages and they got a dead babies </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and you're like,</v>

3683
02:55:21.981 --> 02:55:23.630
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

3684
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:26.840
<v Speaker 2>That seems like hell like you've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've created hell so that you can make</v>

3685
02:55:26.841 --> 02:55:28.540
<v Speaker 2>bacon like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a.</v>

3686
02:55:28.610 --> 02:55:29.443
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy way of contracting or </v>

3687
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:35.090
<v Speaker 2>getting your food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bacon tastes so good.</v>

3688
02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I know ecolab is a large group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria with multiple strains,</v>

3689
02:55:38.151 --> 02:55:38.984
<v Speaker 2>most of which are harmless and part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the normal flora of bacteria in the </v>

3690
02:55:41.661 --> 02:55:42.494
<v Speaker 2>digestive tract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HarmfuL strains of ecolab produced </v>

3691
02:55:44.751 --> 02:55:47.720
<v Speaker 2>something called shiga toxin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which can be deadly.</v>

3692
02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:49.633
<v Speaker 2>The strain an under cooked ground beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's infected people through the </v>

3693
02:55:53.781 --> 02:55:56.840
<v Speaker 2>consumption of undercooked ground beef </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

3694
02:55:56.890 --> 02:55:59.780
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a toxin than exists in cattle.</v>

3695
02:56:00.290 --> 02:56:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it goes this time.</v>

3696
02:56:02.631 --> 02:56:03.464
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toxic strain of ecolab has been </v>

3697
02:56:04.941 --> 02:56:05.774
<v Speaker 2>found on romaine lettuce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which likely became contaminated from </v>

3698
02:56:08.841 --> 02:56:10.370
<v Speaker 2>nearby cattle manure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3699
02:56:10.371 --> 02:56:13.530
<v Speaker 2>that's what It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the recent outbreak and yeah,</v>

3700
02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:15.860
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's happened before that I read</v>

3701
02:56:15.861 --> 02:56:19.160
<v Speaker 2>about it as well with the other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was spinach.</v>

3702
02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they had an issue with spinach </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past,</v>

3703
02:56:21.261 --> 02:56:24.740
<v Speaker 2>which was getting hoever when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the news came out,</v>

3704
02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:25.953
<v Speaker 2>joe the other lower watching smith </v>
<v Speaker 2>perform and he had a spirit as job it </v>

3705
02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.930
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was hilarious to us.</v>

3706
02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:35.000
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm spinach.</v>

3707
02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3708
02:56:35.810 --> 02:56:37.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3709
02:56:37.780 --> 02:56:38.071
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3710
02:56:38.071 --> 02:56:38.904
<v Speaker 2>the thing of spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he said it was a good time to </v>

3711
02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:42.260
<v Speaker 2>beat up popeye.</v>

3712
02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:48.600
<v Speaker 9>That's a typical phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He's so silly.</v>

3713
02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:51.150
<v Speaker 9>He's a funny dude either,</v>
<v Speaker 9>buddy.</v>

3714
02:56:51.490 --> 02:56:53.500
<v Speaker 2>He's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice guy though,</v>

3715
02:56:53.501 --> 02:56:54.050
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3716
02:56:54.050 --> 02:56:57.010
<v Speaker 2>he's very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny dude though,</v>

3717
02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:58.970
<v Speaker 2>that like that kind of joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3718
02:56:59.450 --> 02:57:02.420
<v Speaker 9>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

3719
02:57:02.430 --> 02:57:06.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a good time to beat up popeye guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3720
02:57:06.441 --> 02:57:07.274
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not from the vegetables </v>

3721
02:57:08.601 --> 02:57:10.460
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing like that,</v>

3722
02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:11.413
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of diseases or from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental toxins from the nearby </v>

3723
02:57:14.481 --> 02:57:17.000
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the letter was grown.</v>

3724
02:57:17.090 --> 02:57:21.590
<v Speaker 2>It grew with equally in it on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it caught on it somehow.</v>

3725
02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:23.233
<v Speaker 2>The cattle manure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even washing that letter is you </v>

3726
02:57:25.581 --> 02:57:26.810
<v Speaker 2>couldn't not take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3727
02:57:26.811 --> 02:57:28.520
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I think you can.</v>

3728
02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I think if you washed lettuce you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out,</v>

3729
02:57:31.250 --> 02:57:33.770
<v Speaker 2>but if you cook it you much more likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill it.</v>

3730
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:34.843
<v Speaker 2>Like for broccoli and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're much more likely to be able to </v>

3731
02:57:37.431 --> 02:57:38.780
<v Speaker 2>kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3732
02:57:38.810 --> 02:57:39.643
<v Speaker 2>kale stir fried kale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the crazy thing is like had that </v>

3733
02:57:42.441 --> 02:57:43.274
<v Speaker 2>happened in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like was that a normal thing that would </v>

3734
02:57:45.111 --> 02:57:46.760
<v Speaker 2>have happened on a regular farm?</v>

3735
02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:48.073
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just had a farm that wasn't a </v>

3736
02:57:49.401 --> 02:57:53.330
<v Speaker 2>factory farm is just let the animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>roam around just be themselves.</v>

3737
02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Would that have happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it still possible?</v>

3738
02:57:55.401 --> 02:57:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Or is it only happened when you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>contain a certain amount of animals?</v>

3739
02:57:59.451 --> 02:58:00.284
<v Speaker 2>In a certain area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also try to grow vegetables in </v>

3740
02:58:01.831 --> 02:58:04.980
<v Speaker 2>that same area too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3741
02:58:04.981 --> 02:58:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people got eco lie back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

3742
02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's not a new thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get sick from guest.</v>

3743
02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:11.730
<v Speaker 2>They didn't clean it well enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way they're doing it,</v>

3744
02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:14.580
<v Speaker 2>it's probably before refrigerators for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3745
02:58:14.581 --> 02:58:15.950
<v Speaker 2>They probably got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3746
02:58:16.090 --> 02:58:19.710
<v Speaker 2>they must've got it like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet people got food poisoning left and</v>

3747
02:58:19.711 --> 02:58:21.880
<v Speaker 2>right before refrigerators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before always had diarrhea before.</v>

3749
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I know right before they was telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3750
02:58:28.321 --> 02:58:30.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>in the backyard and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They can find a dead rat.</v>

3756

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3762
02:58:53.821 --> 02:58:55.470
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a rat,</v>

3763
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:57.630
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero problems.</v>

3764
02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Ate steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time I left in my car overnight.</v>

3765
02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:04.060
<v Speaker 2>didn't know us can be a great lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these tips.</v>

3766
02:59:04.470 --> 02:59:06.960
<v Speaker 2>It was so good eating it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was sick for like three days.</v>

3767
02:59:07.100 --> 02:59:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bad.</v>

3768
02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Bad lesson learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you try to reheat in the microwave?</v>

3769
02:59:11.650 --> 02:59:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it in a skillet to a thing.</v>

3770
02:59:13.290 --> 02:59:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I was working at a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3771
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:18.840
<v Speaker 2>we made all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you knew they probably had to cook it</v>

3772
02:59:18.841 --> 02:59:20.670
<v Speaker 2>again and you thought it would be fine?</v>

03:09:30.370 --> 03:09:31.810
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I can do this.</v>

4003
03:09:32.130 --> 03:09:33.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I did.</v>

4004
03:09:33.380 --> 03:09:34.213
<v Speaker 2>It waSn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was definitely thinking this </v>

4005
03:09:35.860 --> 03:09:36.693
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

4006
03:09:36.820 --> 03:09:38.780
<v Speaker 2>this is something that you could get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at.</v>

4007
03:09:38.920 --> 03:09:40.810
<v Speaker 2>You could figure it out and you could do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4008
03:09:41.950 --> 03:09:44.980
<v Speaker 2>But I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'm going to ever be able</v>

4009
03:09:44.981 --> 03:09:45.814
<v Speaker 2>to have a real job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just too dysfunctional way to </v>

4010
03:09:48.821 --> 03:09:51.460
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was way too crazy.</v>

4011
03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:52.473
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a lot of drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of being in an office and </v>

4012
03:09:56.501 --> 03:09:57.820
<v Speaker 2>being trapped like that.</v>

4013
03:09:57.820 --> 03:10:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a like a caged in alley cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no way man.</v>

4014
03:10:02.861 --> 03:10:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more out there.</v>

4015
03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I just want to add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4016
03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:09.333
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might not have even been an ambItion </v>

4017
03:10:10.661 --> 03:10:11.494
<v Speaker 2>thing as much of an intolerance thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that I had this grand plan for </v>

4018
03:10:14.951 --> 03:10:15.784
<v Speaker 2>myself like I thought I deserved better </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to be the top of this </v>

4019
03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:21.550
<v Speaker 2>fucking kick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that I couldn't do that.</v>

4020
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about milk monotonous,</v>

4021
03:10:24.401 --> 03:10:25.234
<v Speaker 2>boring shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brain is screaming for new </v>

4022
03:10:27.191 --> 03:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always does my number.</v>

4023
03:10:29.580 --> 03:10:30.413
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a bad thing because </v>

4024
03:10:32.921 --> 03:10:33.754
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't construct things because you </v>

4025
03:10:35.801 --> 03:10:36.634
<v Speaker 2>want to think about other things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are better and more crazy and more </v>

4026
03:10:38.291 --> 03:10:39.640
<v Speaker 2>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fun.</v>

4027
03:10:40.030 --> 03:10:40.863
<v Speaker 2>So it's like trying to manage that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset with a regular jobs almost </v>

4028
03:10:44.891 --> 03:10:46.210
<v Speaker 2>impossible to me.</v>

4029
03:10:46.210 --> 03:10:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to,</v>

4030
03:10:48.010 --> 03:10:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to quit done,</v>

4031
03:10:50.321 --> 03:10:53.620
<v Speaker 2>can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was just a constant grind</v>

4032
03:10:53.621 --> 03:10:58.150
<v Speaker 2>on your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pulling your skin down and dragging</v>

4033
03:10:58.151 --> 03:11:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you into this state where you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to exist.</v>

4034
03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:04.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some people are different.</v>

4035
03:11:04.181 --> 03:11:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Some people have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find a great job,</v>

4036
03:11:06.730 --> 03:11:07.563
<v Speaker 2>they're super happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make friends with the people they </v>

4037
03:11:08.651 --> 03:11:09.484
<v Speaker 2>work with and every day is a pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just get in there and they </v>

4038
03:11:11.771 --> 03:11:14.110
<v Speaker 2>laugh and joke around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm too fucked up.</v>

4039
03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:14.973
<v Speaker 2>I can't sit still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a million other things that I </v>

4040
03:11:16.721 --> 03:11:19.360
<v Speaker 2>want to do while someone's talking to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about some boring shit.</v>

4041
03:11:19.540 --> 03:11:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I've got like five other things I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

4042
03:11:21.101 --> 03:11:22.480

<v Speaker 2>I can't take this.</v>

4044
03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:26.620
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stir crazy.</v>

4176
03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:01.150
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A broader racist jokes.</v>

4177
03:18:01.210 --> 03:18:04.450
<v Speaker 2>They're so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so simple.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4179
03:18:06.491 --> 03:18:07.324
<v Speaker 2>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you gotta realize the world's a </v>

4180
03:18:08.951 --> 03:18:11.280
<v Speaker 2>different place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When richard pryor was doing that man,</v>

4181
03:18:11.290 --> 03:18:14.080
<v Speaker 2>the world was a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be first to.</v>

4182
03:18:14.230 --> 03:18:15.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not necessarily first I think is </v>

4183
03:18:17.020 --> 03:18:17.853
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's like this progression and I </v>

4184
03:18:19.631 --> 03:18:20.740
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4185
03:18:20.741 --> 03:18:22.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians get inspired by the other ones</v>

4186
03:18:22.391 --> 03:18:23.224
<v Speaker 2>that are around them and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>really just starting it in the 19 </v>

4187
03:18:24.671 --> 03:18:25.840
<v Speaker 2>fifties and sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4188
03:18:26.080 --> 03:18:26.913
<v Speaker 2>So then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lenny bruce was probably the first guy </v>

4189
03:18:28.181 --> 03:18:31.840
<v Speaker 2>who does our style of comedy was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about things like,</v>

4190
03:18:31.841 --> 03:18:33.000
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4191
03:18:33.010 --> 03:18:34.180
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

4192
03:18:34.360 --> 03:18:36.340
<v Speaker 2>why isn't this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who caused this?</v>

4193
03:18:36.341 --> 03:18:37.174
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just telling a bunch of </v>

4194
03:18:37.811 --> 03:18:38.644
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about things and point </v>

4195
03:18:40.241 --> 03:18:41.830
<v Speaker 2>things out that happened to be funny.</v>

4196
03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:42.933
<v Speaker 2>And then richard pryor comes on after </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and makes it way funnier because </v>

4197
03:18:45.971 --> 03:18:49.360
<v Speaker 2>what he did was like the same of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but way funnier.</v>

4198
03:18:49.580 --> 03:18:50.413
<v Speaker 2>Like richard pryor had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another level of evolution </v>

4199
03:18:53.321 --> 03:18:57.190
<v Speaker 2>that he achieved inspired off the work </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the guys that were before him.</v>

4200
03:18:57.191 --> 03:18:59.110
<v Speaker 2>The mort sols and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4201
03:18:59.170 --> 03:19:04.120
<v Speaker 2>those guys inspired prior and prior of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course inspires everybody.</v>

4202
03:19:04.121 --> 03:19:06.220
<v Speaker 2>It all comeS from prior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the early.</v>

4203
03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:10.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like lenny bruce is just this </v>
<v Speaker 2>genius mind opening guy.</v>

4204
03:19:10.181 --> 03:19:11.950
<v Speaker 2>That's dealing with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep.</v>

4205
03:19:12.190 --> 03:19:16.210
<v Speaker 2>he's in a world of the 19 fifties and 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties where people just asleep.</v>

4206
03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:17.313
<v Speaker 2>They're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're disconnected from the world </v>

4207
03:19:19.541 --> 03:19:21.760
<v Speaker 2>around them from critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're just,</v>

4208
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:25.210
<v Speaker 2>they're just starting to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally and then boom.</v>

4209
03:19:25.211 --> 03:19:26.044
<v Speaker 2>Richard pryor takes that and turns it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the funny shit that anybody had </v>
