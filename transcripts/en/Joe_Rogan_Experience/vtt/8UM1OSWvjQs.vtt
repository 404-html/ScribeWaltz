1
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Brian Post St Ladies and gentlemen just got done doing the podcast.</v>

3
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.091
<v Speaker 2>You're hilarious.</v>

4
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 2>As always.</v>

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.523
<v Speaker 2>Thanks buddy.</v>

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Brian is one of those dudes that I've known for about probably 15 years or</v>

7
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:24.374
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

8
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 2>But I've been down here since.</v>

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time we ever really sat down and were like a serious</v>

10
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 2>conversation for sure.</v>

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 2>But we talked when we worked together show.</v>

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

13
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.681
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>

14
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Like the two hours.</v>

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.131
<v Speaker 2>That was fun man.</v>

16
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.964
<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>

17
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Brian is no longer in the pot club.</v>

18
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 2>You folks,</v>

19
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.123
<v Speaker 2>I'll be back.</v>

20
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 2>We caught him three months completely sober cause that's gotta be a weird thing</v>

21
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 2>to be like the POC community.</v>

22
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 2>He was one of those guys,</v>

23
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:48.254
<v Speaker 2>one of them.</v>

24
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm worth the metal community until somebody pointed out to me and I was like,</v>

25
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:52.731
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

26
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

27
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

29
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

30
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 2>definitely don't do that many pot jokes,</v>

31
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 2>but it all kind of came from a plot place.</v>

32
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

33
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>most of those jokes were written while I was high.</v>

34
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.091
<v Speaker 2>And the thing,</v>

35
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 2>the important thing is that he's the one that indoctrinated duct Bateson who's</v>

36
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 2>probably the biggest pothead comedian.</v>

37
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean nobody's connected more to pot as a comic than duck.</v>

38
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like teaching karyotype about props like yes,</v>

39
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.933
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

40
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's worse.</v>

41
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 2>These two things together and make fun of that.</v>

42
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

43
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

44
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.261
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say worse,</v>

45
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's bigger because carrot tops not spreading props all across the</v>

46
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 2>country and getting other people to do props.</v>

47
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's done for that movie.</v>

48
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 2>Super High.</v>

49
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

50
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 2>How many people got started smoking weed because of that movie?</v>

51
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>That a lot.</v>

52
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

53
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I've been a lot of people looked at that and go,</v>

54
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man?</v>

55
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.513
<v Speaker 2>He looks fine.</v>

56
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Print would bring up all over here.</v>

57
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 2>So this is if you,</v>

58
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>if you're upset and Doug done some monsters I guess.</v>

59
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.923
<v Speaker 2>I bet you did dude.</v>

61
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.383
<v Speaker 2>You spawned it.</v>

62
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.421
<v Speaker 2>Brian Post saying,</v>

63
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:48.254
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

68
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.133
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate it.</v>

69
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Looks like that city and salt city.</v>

70
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.384
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

71
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.130
<v Speaker 2>all this salt on the ground is actually what I get out of the tub.</v>

72
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.773
<v Speaker 2>The tank rather,</v>

73
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 2>and it's also because a,</v>

74
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time,</v>

75
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:16.451
<v Speaker 2>back in the past I had a rupture in the lining and the saltwater leaked out and</v>

76
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 2>got over the floor and we had a wine and cleaning it out and doing a bunch of</v>

77
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>different things to fix it.</v>

78
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 2>New Tank from folate lab,</v>

79
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 2>float lab technology and so this all this shit on the ground.</v>

80
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.434
<v Speaker 2>It's all just songs,</v>

81
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Yolanda and all that.</v>

82
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Now it's kind of boring.</v>

83
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Our cane,</v>

84
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.823
<v Speaker 2>Neil Brennan,</v>

85
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for being on the Poncho,</v>

86
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

87
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Pleasure was all mine and get you into the isolation.</v>

88
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.061
<v Speaker 2>It's in Venice.</v>

89
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:48.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call him for you.</v>

90
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 2>It'd be an awesome thing for you to sit and think of ideas.</v>

91
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no environment like that on the planet where you don't feel your body</v>

92
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 2>disconnect from your body and you're all inside your head.</v>

93
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

94
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.213
<v Speaker 2>Pretty close to,</v>

95
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm just walking around,</v>

96
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm so in my head,</v>

97
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

98
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

99
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

100
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm a human isolation.</v>

101
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Well in your head,</v>

102
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 2>in your head there would be no,</v>

103
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking here.</v>

104
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>When does it kick in?</v>

105
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

106
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how relaxed you know,</v>

107
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>how much you can let go.</v>

108
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 2>It takes a while to get comfortable with the experience cause it's so weird.</v>

109
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I would cry.</v>

110
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.503
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

111
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.373
<v Speaker 2>You might cry.</v>

112
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever cried?</v>

113
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Not In there,</v>

114
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.103
<v Speaker 2>but in real life yet.</v>

115
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 2>You have several times.</v>

116
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.773
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

117
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh no more than that.</v>

118
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
<v Speaker 2>No person.</v>

119
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.271
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

120
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't cry your nap.</v>

121
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

122
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 2>It takes up more than a cartoon to get me to cry.</v>

123
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Brown.</v>

124
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.110
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of tears.</v>

125
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.751
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

126
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.141
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

127
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>it takes three d and live action.</v>

128
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I kind of titanic like a motherfucker should really?</v>

129
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

131

<v Speaker 2>did you really like titanic?</v>

132
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I liked about it when they were,</v>

133
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>they did the flyover of the ship.</v>

135
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the people walking and it's cause it's old CGI,</v>

136
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>they like still robotic.</v>

137
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy that about it.</v>

139
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite part of titanic.</v>

140
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 2>When everything looks fake like it.</v>

141
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a dumb move and I liked it.</v>

142
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

143
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I like the Capri.</v>

144
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I would like it if it was just the thing crashing into the water because the</v>

145
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>special effects were awesome.</v>

146
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.983
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

147
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.853
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

148
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>You didn't like when he stenciled her,</v>

149
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

150
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.431
<v Speaker 2>It probably,</v>

151
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 2>that would have been that.</v>

152
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

153
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

154
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And I liked that she was naked and still like that was nice that you can think</v>

155
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

156
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what an awful double standard the MPA has.</v>

157
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that like she was tasteful naked right now,</v>

158
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>but she's still naked.</v>

159
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

160
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I still saw a woman's netball.</v>

161
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Did you see her nipple?</v>

162
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

163
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I think I even remember whatever happened.</v>

164
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:43.834
<v Speaker 2>That chick,</v>

165
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 2>she turned into a meet Bob Wright and she,</v>

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.031
<v Speaker 2>she's all right.</v>

168
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:49.650
<v Speaker 2>She got big.</v>

169
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.891

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

173
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Probably smaller than she was then Barilla.</v>

180
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the Internet will agree.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

264
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I first started the comedy store,</v>

265
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Joe was just,</v>

266
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

267
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.420
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

268
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.470
<v Speaker 3>you were the man killing it and now you're killing it here and you know,</v>

269
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

270
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store was a fun place back in the day.</v>

271
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.673
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

272
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>it's my cuts can't go back.</v>

273
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.010
<v Speaker 3>I first remembered Mazda's name all the time because every time you saw him you</v>

274
00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:21.060
<v Speaker 3>would always sing his song.</v>

275
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.133
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

276
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.663
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know why man.</v>

278
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 3>I think Joey Diaz,</v>

279
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Diaz Joey would come in during my sets in the middle of my son.</v>

280
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Just start singing.</v>

281
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.220
<v Speaker 3>I would cut.</v>

282
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.053

<v Speaker 2>it's mine.</v>

285
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.950
<v Speaker 2>When Joey stopped coming to the comedy store,</v>

286
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:40.180
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that killed it.</v>

287
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 2>She always stopped coming six months before the I got kicked out of their nose.</v>

288
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>When he stopped coming here,</v>

289
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:47.171
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

290

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 2>They thought they were going to drop off the edge of the earth.</v>

440
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 2>They thought that they can get to the point there was in the ocean,</v>

441
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have a drop off and that would be,</v>

442
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 2>they fucking took a chance and they got all the way to America,</v>
