<v Speaker 2>Well we just want to hear.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're having a good time up there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>God's country.</v>

19
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

20
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho.</v>

21
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.573
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about how awesome it </v>

22
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 2>is up there and we're getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>snow.</v>

23
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got to get on a ton of snow </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the north,</v>

24
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:44.424
<v Speaker 2>particularly here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're getting just hammered five </v>

25
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 2>feet up in big bear.</v>

26
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Bear apparently just got covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>snow,</v>

27
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.433
<v Speaker 2>which is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had like 330 inches of snow up where </v>

28
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 2>we've got a place up in about two hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of Boise,</v>

29
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.523
<v Speaker 2>up in the mountains where we go skiing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fishing and I'm not at the same </v>

30
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a hell of a sport.</v>

31
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Someone's probably done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>

32
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:07.884
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know the guys are cross country </v>

33
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 2>skiing into hunting spots now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a thing that guys are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually these foldable skis and</v>

35
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 2>you strapped these things on and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can stuff in your pack when you're done.</v>

36
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And apparently it's way better than snow</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>

37
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 2>So when guys are trying to traverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really unpack like fresh snow,</v>

38
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>no path fix stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing cross country skiing.</v>

39
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.154
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>

40
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 2>That's tough work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

41
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as tough as snow shoes.</v>

42
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 2>Snow shoeing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a grind for any distance.</v>

43
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

44
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

45
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:37.764
<v Speaker 2>you know what you do see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were skiing fresh tracks off </v>

46
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>off the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.863
<v Speaker 2>the side back backside of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains that we ski is two weeks ago </v>

48
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 2>and the snow was falling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no wind,</v>

49
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 2>it was just beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nobody we didn't.</v>

50
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.863
<v Speaker 2>I think we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we saw two other skiers the </v>

51
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.864
<v Speaker 2>whole time that we were out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just stopped constantly and just stare </v>

52
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 2>and look around and you think how </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful it says,</v>

53
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.243
<v Speaker 2>and then I do what everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take out my phone to it cause I'm </v>

54
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:09.351
<v Speaker 2>going to capture the moment on my phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera and somehow get the grand of this</v>

<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>more crowded up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

70
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like a high end,</v>

71
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 2>a great town.</v>

73
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 2>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two blue spots in Idaho.</v>

77
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>in that particular county because of Sun</v>
<v Speaker 2>Valley being there.</v>

78
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>And so we get a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of wealthy folks,</v>

79
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's a beautiful town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great community.</v>

80
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.823
<v Speaker 2>It's a year round community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some other towns is a place </v>

81
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.770

<v Speaker 2>up in the mountains and it's a real </v>

93
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>beautiful Idaho is because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep people out.</v>

94
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I shouldn't do that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>anything remotely like our public land </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

148
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.350

<v Speaker 3>these charts that show the billions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars that go towards </v>

162
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 3>conservation every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All because of people who fish and hunt.</v>

163
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the numbers are staggering.</v>

164
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.950
<v Speaker 3>You go to Cabela's and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wondered about this.</v>

165
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.793
<v Speaker 3>You go to buy something at a Cabela's or</v>
<v Speaker 3>bass pro or wherever you got in your </v>

166
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 3>local area and you know routinely </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying,</v>

167
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you like to donate a dollar to</v>

168
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.953
<v Speaker 3>conservation fund?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you like to donate a dollar to a </v>

169
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Speaker 3>course?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would,</v>

170
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>because that's a percentage of your sale</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes directly to it anyway.</v>

171
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 3>If you're hunting equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain percentage,</v>

172
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good healthy percentage.</v>

173
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 3>It turns out to be millions and millions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of dollars every year.</v>

174
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Minnesota,</v>

175
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people hunt or fish in Minnesota,</v>

176
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.314
<v Speaker 3>one point six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$5 million than doubled the combined </v>

177
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 3>populations of Minneapolis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>St Paul,</v>

178
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Rochester and Duluth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and three point one,</v>

179
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 3>$7 billion is the amount spent by 1 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million,</v>

180
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:51.854
<v Speaker 3>649,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters and anglers in a single year in </v>

181
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota.</v>

182
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.843
<v Speaker 3>That's an incredibly large part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy folks and a giant chunk of that </v>

183
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:00.164
<v Speaker 3>goes to preserving wildlife habitat to </v>
<v Speaker 3>preserving wetlands to make ensure that </v>

184
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:05.774
<v Speaker 3>animal populations are kept healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make sure that Predator populations </v>

185
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 3>are kept in balance and that ranchers </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't,</v>

186
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:12.074
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impeded upon by mountain lions and </v>

187
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 3>wolves and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

188
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 3>it's an incredible number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

189
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just for Minnesota,</v>

190
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.313
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

192
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 3>and then you think of the other states </v>
<v Speaker 3>all combining together.</v>

193
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.803
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the reason why we have more white </v>

194
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 3>tail deer in America today than when </v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus landed.</v>

195
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Support.</v>

196
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.123
<v Speaker 3>We'll get this Michigan $576 million in </v>
<v Speaker 3>state and local tax revenue enough to </v>

197
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 3>support the average salaries of nearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>11,000</v>

198
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 3>police and sheriff's officers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

199
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know we could still mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Columbus.</v>

200
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that was allowed.</v>

201
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 3>What's allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can talk about them.</v>

202
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kinda crazy.</v>

203
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Columbus Day when you find out what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>savage.</v>

204
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 3>He was like a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus was Columbus Day.</v>

205
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 3>What do we have any Stevia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay?</v>

206
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.280
<v Speaker 3>This tastes like shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

207
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fan of this the way it is with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the butter.</v>

208
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emulsified mct oil,</v>

209
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:04.604
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like it blended into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that I'm expecting the other </v>

210
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 3>kinds of coffee and it comes out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

211
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.383
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

212
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.620
<v Speaker 3>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all.</v>

213
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not the best at what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back to the old way.</v>

214
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think it's okay.</v>

215
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little different.</v>

216
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:18.914
<v Speaker 3>Tastes sweeter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something we need less of it or </v>

217
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:22.360
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

218
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm just a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you drink a day?</v>

219
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Let's have coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even count it.</v>

220
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>I just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

221
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to worry about it.</v>

222
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:31.561
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

223
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:32.394
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should back up off the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coffee is an excellent source of </v>

224
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 3>antioxidants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It if you're not,</v>

225
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.833
<v Speaker 3>you're not dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're drinking plenty of water on </v>

226
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 3>top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always drink water with it and I don't</v>

227
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:43.004
<v Speaker 3>see any negative effects when I go get </v>
<v Speaker 3>my health stuff done and get blood work </v>

228

<v Speaker 2>They're these little tiny things there.</v>

235

<v Speaker 2>Nitrogenated coffee that's 270 </v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams of caffeine and one little </v>

<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:14.400

<v Speaker 2>I take these four,</v>

240
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:15.234
<v Speaker 2>I lift weights and I want to throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>things through the fucking walls and I </v>

241
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:19.280

<v Speaker 2>That little tiny thing is 270 milligrams</v>

243
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.820
<v Speaker 2>of caffeine and it's nitrogenated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which that's fine.</v>

244
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got an early call in the morning.</v>

247
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I got an early start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of activity going on.</v>

248
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to pop this in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

249
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>We'll give you a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what you can do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll give them to the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

251
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.893
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be good.</v>

252
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Have you liked the taste of actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee?</v>

253
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:43.824
<v Speaker 2>It's really good coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a whole story behind </v>

254
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's this one farm in Columbia.</v>

255
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Single source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single family.</v>

256
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.500
<v Speaker 2>It is Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

257
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Even things that I know for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say them and I'll go.</v>

258
00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right away I question myself.</v>

259
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to erase some of my data.</v>

260
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've paired it down.</v>

261
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm streamlining now thinking of the bar</v>

262
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe just a little kick boxing,</v>

263
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:14.110
<v Speaker 2>sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to trim down some of my memories.</v>

264
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Few too many in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have to take a couple of jabs.</v>

265
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.790
<v Speaker 2>It says my boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of my boys,</v>

266
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.601
<v Speaker 2>actually all three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

267
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 2>what am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All three of them.</v>

268
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

269
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

270
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.740
<v Speaker 2>my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scooter and sluggo and mugsy or nine,</v>

271
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.630
<v Speaker 2>five hilarious names and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

272
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Former CIA operatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

273
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 2>But like the three stooges and so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.410
<v Speaker 2>but they in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in taekwondo now.</v>

275
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 2>We looked around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we checked out a few places and we found</v>

276
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:42.110
<v Speaker 2>this one that we really like.</v>

277
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 2>And then also to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it is just timing.</v>

278
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:45.381
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

279
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:46.060
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

280
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.893
<v Speaker 2>they're structuring their classwork or </v>
<v Speaker 2>their timing works well with other </v>

281
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 2>things kids are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're in there.</v>

282
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 2>How old are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nine,</v>

283
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:53.244
<v Speaker 2>seven and five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good age to start taekwondo </v>

284
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:58.550
<v Speaker 2>because then you'll learn the dexterity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the flexibility and stuff like that.</v>

285
00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 2>And if they really get serious about </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>

286
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you can transition them to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Jujitsu or kickboxing or something.</v>

287
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.973
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the middle one will stick with </v>

288
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has is supremely focused.</v>

289
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:10.554
<v Speaker 2>The only one is does very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a variety of other </v>

290
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.351
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

291
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 2>And right now he sees focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on other sports,</v>

292
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Lacrosse and basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

293
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.310
<v Speaker 2>that middle one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.403
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just kind of watch them and </v>

295
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:20.701
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:21.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

297
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Your kids spark on different things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems to have really sparked on this.</v>

298
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the five year old,</v>

299
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:27.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does great,</v>

300
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a sparked on candy bars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

301
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the fascinating things </v>

302
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:34.644
<v Speaker 2>about having kids is to realize there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only so much that you do to shape their </v>

303
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:38.514
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come out of the box unique in a </v>

304
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:41.664
<v Speaker 2>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have two daughters that are </v>

305
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.064
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was six and an eight and they are so </v>

306
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

307
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 2>so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six year old thinks farts are hilarious.</v>

308
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 2>She's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she'll say,</v>

309
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.573
<v Speaker 2>can I tell you something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I tell you so she just on you and </v>

310
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 2>then she'll fall to the ground laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got to meet my five-year-old.</v>

311
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Those still get along like a house on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

312
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets mad at her and just can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

313
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.610
<v Speaker 2>You just can't be farting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm laughing.</v>

314
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't laugh at her.</v>

315
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is hilarious.</v>

316
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Just farted on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the goal?</v>

317
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Is more of a girly girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

318
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Much more of a girly girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six year olds is savage.</v>

319
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 2>He's like a little gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's really hilarious.</v>

320
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 2>She's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very funny.</v>

321
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well my three disbanded.</v>

322
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 2>They spend all their time just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>every other kid,</v>

323
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But boys in particular,</v>

324
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>they spend all their time beating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of each other.</v>

325
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.193
<v Speaker 2>And so we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what we've been looking for </v>

326
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 2>awhile to find the right place for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to channel that physical side of things.</v>

327
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's good because now they focus</v>

328
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

329
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 2>if they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're gonna hurt each other,</v>

330
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.484
<v Speaker 2>they're going to hurt them each other in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper way as get some spartan and </v>

331
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.453
<v Speaker 2>get some sports.</v>

332
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 2>One of the good things about Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 2>we had talked about getting your kids in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>

334
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 2>The good thing about Jujitsu is you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go full blast.</v>

335
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 2>The thing about kicking each other in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head is,</v>

336
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.274
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could really only do that a couple </v>

337
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 2>of times and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

338
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

339
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 2>You just not the same person anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality.</v>

340
00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.613
<v Speaker 2>My kids are allowed to kick me and punch</v>
<v Speaker 2>me full blast as long as they tell me </v>

341
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:03.184
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like let them throw full power leg </v>

342
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:06.784
<v Speaker 2>kicks because I'm trying to teach them </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to like really sink the Shin into </v>

343
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 2>the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

344
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 2>So like my daughter will throw a left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hook to the body,</v>

345
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 2>right leg kick combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to do it right now.</v>

346
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.131
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

347
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:16.830
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like boom,</v>

348
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 2>like it's getting harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

349
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 2>As you get eight and 10 around like 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to tell them to stop.</v>

350
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:22.601
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's enough.</v>

351
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Now that is going to have to pat up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a chest pat on.</v>

352
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 2>But that's a difference between boys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>

353
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.693
<v Speaker 2>Girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say you're gonna have to tell </v>

354
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:28.451
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

355
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>you can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to tell me.</v>

356
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.300
<v Speaker 2>My guys are like Keto from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I walk in the house and they're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>lurking somewhere.</v>

358
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 2>And then the whole goal is to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>punch me in the junk.</v>

359
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.070
<v Speaker 2>And they think that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the,</v>

360
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:41.904
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

361
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 2>the middle one again in the middle one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he a sluggo he caught me one time when I</v>

362
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:48.334
<v Speaker 2>came in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the front door of the house and I was </v>

363
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.094
<v Speaker 2>carrying a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just gotten off a plane carrying it </v>

364
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.014
<v Speaker 2>back and before I could even put the bag</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and sale and the kids were kind of </v>

365
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:57.000
<v Speaker 2>coming down the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like a Norman Rockwell </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

367
00:13:58.631 --> 00:13:59.464
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come hug their dad and </v>

368
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:01.610
<v Speaker 2>adore me a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Daddy's home and sluggo comes around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner and nowhere and says dad and just</v>

370
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 2>punches me square in the nuts and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hard that I literally,</v>

371
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

372
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.513
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.853
<v Speaker 2>you just dropped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped and he and the other to stand </v>

374
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 2>there and laugh in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

375
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:21.244
<v Speaker 2>what the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife is coming around the corner and </v>

376
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:22.871
<v Speaker 2>she looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

377
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:23.710
<v Speaker 2>what the hell happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

378
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

379
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.450
<v Speaker 2>How old was he at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was six.</v>

380
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.323
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So raise a little six year old and the </v>

381
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 2>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of wolves and you start punching</v>

382
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 2>you in the Dick as soon as they see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a larry.</v>

383
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.010
<v Speaker 2>It's Idaho hope rating all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Jan is out there.</v>

384
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

385
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

386
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 2>what's your take on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump versus the intelligence community?</v>

387
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.673
<v Speaker 2>Jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be going on right now </v>

388
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 2>because I couldn't to get you in here to</v>

389
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.083
<v Speaker 3>get an insider's perspective on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've never seen anything like </v>

390
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:56.984
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've never seen anything like </v>

391
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>what he was talking shit about flu shots</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

392
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 3>He's like flu shots and the biggest scam</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

393
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you sure you've done research?</v>

394
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Are you a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

395
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that whole and he's.</v>

396
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 4>And he's kind of a point that not </v>
<v Speaker 4>appointed,</v>

397
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:12.674
<v Speaker 4>but he's brought somebody in as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>advisor on that who is against </v>

398
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 4>vaccinations when that term is and know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the Intel thing.</v>

399
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 4>There's so many ways you can take this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a.</v>

400
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 4>basically it was a self inflicted wound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was unnecessary.</v>

401
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 4>There was no reason for him in the early</v>
<v Speaker 4>stage of this,</v>

402
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 4>when that narrative started to build </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

403
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:34.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this rift building between trump</v>

404
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 4>and the intel community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was because of his tweets,</v>

405
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:37.963
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was because of him questioning </v>

406
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.213
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intelligence about Russian meddling </v>

407
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.693
<v Speaker 4>in our election system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now to talk about that just for a </v>

408
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 4>second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

409
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.303
<v Speaker 4>the Russians were meddling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Russians have been meddling in US </v>

410
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:55.094
<v Speaker 4>politics and campaigning over here in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way since they've been around as have </v>

411
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as have the Chinese.</v>

412
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:01.723
<v Speaker 4>You could go back to when people should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was a fascinating period of time </v>

413
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.343
<v Speaker 4>and in history back to like 1941 go back</v>
<v Speaker 4>to when the Russians were still in an </v>

414
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:14.291
<v Speaker 4>alliance and a pact with the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so from the Russian perspective,</v>

415
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 4>their goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

416
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.860
<v Speaker 4>their point was to keep the US out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the war and so what did they do?</v>

417
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.733
<v Speaker 4>There's an isolation is wing in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>States and Roosevelt was under a lot of </v>

418
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:27.020
<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roosevelt was was becoming very close to</v>

419
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Churchill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He understood that threat.</v>

420
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.743
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the few people that did at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time he understood how important it </v>

421
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:33.860
<v Speaker 4>was going to be for America to get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this battle.</v>

422
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.533
<v Speaker 4>The UK was about ready to fall and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>the British were actually running their </v>

423
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:39.644
<v Speaker 4>intelligence operations out of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a place over in Rockville </v>

424
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.503
<v Speaker 4>Rockefeller Center and because they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>worried they were the island was going </v>

425
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:50.380
<v Speaker 4>to be run over by the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have this going on.</v>

426
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 4>The dynamic with the Russians was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were still in this packed,</v>

427
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the Nazi.</v>

428
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.304
<v Speaker 4>Stalin didn't see this coming and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't see that on the Nazis were </v>

429
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 4>running a very large propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 4>campaign,</v>

430
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 4>a diversion effort to ensure that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russians wouldn't know that they will go</v>

431
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:03.854
<v Speaker 4>about to invade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the Russian spent a great deal of </v>

432
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:06.704
<v Speaker 4>time and money and resource here in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>US influencing us public opinion about </v>

433
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:13.410
<v Speaker 4>staying out of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to be in a boy.</v>

434
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:15.080
<v Speaker 4>Why would you want to get into another </v>
<v Speaker 4>war in Europe?</v>

435
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 4>And they bought journalists and placed a</v>
<v Speaker 4>newspaper articles.</v>

436
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:20.324
<v Speaker 4>They paid off journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were setting up associations that </v>

437
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 4>were supposedly independent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're run by the Soviets.</v>

438
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.353
<v Speaker 4>They were influencing unions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dumping money into unions and bing </v>

439
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:35.190
<v Speaker 4>basically to get them to steer their </v>
<v Speaker 4>membership to isolation as you know,</v>

440
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.900
<v Speaker 4>a agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to say that,</v>

441
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the Russians were men.</v>

442
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.130
<v Speaker 4>Like of course they'd been doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way.</v>

443
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.070
<v Speaker 4>And then all the way through the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>War,</v>

444
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

445
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:46.230
<v Speaker 4>this is what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

446
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.293
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it the narrative because it always has </v>

447
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.034
<v Speaker 4>to be simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as far as the media is </v>

448
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:52.794
<v Speaker 4>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the narrative was that they influenced </v>

449
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 4>the election will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

450
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.280
<v Speaker 4>they were meddling but they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>hacking into election systems.</v>

451
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:02.850
<v Speaker 4>They weren't hacking into voting booths </v>
<v Speaker 4>and changing these things.</v>

452
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.493
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

453
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 2>So we say meddling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they were doing is essentially they</v>

454
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:07.524
<v Speaker 2>were getting information that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>private that was being distributed </v>

455
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 2>between the Democratic convention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were definitely involved in,</v>

456
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.183
<v Speaker 2>in the DNC hacking for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were definitely involved in how </v>

457
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 2>were they involved with they involve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they,</v>

458
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:23.811
<v Speaker 2>did they directly did the hacking to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats or were they privy to.</v>

459
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 2>The information because someone sold it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them or got it to them,</v>

460
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.390
<v Speaker 2>as with most of these things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually those cutouts,</v>

461
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:29.911
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

462
00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a plot,</v>

463
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 2>plausible deniability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

464
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Russians have been very.</v>

465
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

466
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.550
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians have been very.</v>

467
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:41.200
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

468
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.120
<v Speaker 4>adapt over the years at creating a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mayhem,</v>

469
00:18:46.121 --> 00:18:49.510
<v Speaker 4>creating chaos around democratic </v>
<v Speaker 4>institutions.</v>

470
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Their whole goal is to chip away at </v>
<v Speaker 4>public trust in,</v>

471
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.690
<v Speaker 4>in a democracy and not just here in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>US,</v>

472
00:18:55.691 --> 00:18:56.471
<v Speaker 4>but everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

473
00:18:56.471 --> 00:18:57.304
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and obviously that played out in proxy </v>

474
00:18:58.211 --> 00:19:01.150
<v Speaker 4>wars out in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so again,</v>

475
00:19:01.151 --> 00:19:01.984
<v Speaker 4>I guess what I'm trying to say is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>should have shocked no one that the </v>

476
00:19:04.631 --> 00:19:06.400
<v Speaker 4>Russians would be engaged in this sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thing.</v>

477
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.950
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

478
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.480
<v Speaker 4>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

479
00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:14.050
<v Speaker 4>a self inflicted wound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hadn't gotten the full briefings yet.</v>

480
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:17.740
<v Speaker 4>He hadn't seen the intelligence about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

481
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.923
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and prior to that then he sending out a </v>

482
00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:21.620
<v Speaker 4>handful of tweets saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

483
00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make any sense.</v>

484
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.693
<v Speaker 4>You have all the opportunity in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world to question the intelligence and </v>

485
00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 4>the time to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

486
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.123
<v Speaker 4>you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting the briefings from the </v>

487
00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:32.890
<v Speaker 4>heads of the agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which happened,</v>

488
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.950
<v Speaker 4>and then if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you notice after that briefing,</v>

489
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.173
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his tone changed completely and he came </v>

490
00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:42.160
<v Speaker 4>out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

491
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.380
<v Speaker 4>well the Russians were involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

492
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it didn't make it.</v>

493
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Now he had to walk that back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then he goes out to the agency and in</v>

494
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.381
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a meeting,</v>

495
00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:51.214
<v Speaker 4>which I think was a great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really happy to see that he did </v>

496
00:19:53.261 --> 00:19:54.094
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so soon in the administration he </v>

497
00:19:55.031 --> 00:19:55.864
<v Speaker 4>goes out to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to our headquarters out out there in </v>

498
00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 4>Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

499
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.930
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got sidetracked,</v>

500
00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:05.800
<v Speaker 4>but that's his personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He starts talking about the inauguration</v>

501
00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:08.320
<v Speaker 4>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You start talking about the media,</v>

502
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unfair media.</v>

503
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

504
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.180
<v Speaker 4>you could just go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

505
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.023
<v Speaker 4>People say you're looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 4>working with them to protect national </v>

506
00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:17.020
<v Speaker 4>security interests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shake some hands and leave,</v>

507
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's not in his nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

508
00:20:18.431 --> 00:20:20.950
<v Speaker 4>So he's going to get sidetracked and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got to talk about other things.</v>

509
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:23.410
<v Speaker 4>And then that becomes the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

510
00:20:23.411 --> 00:20:25.030
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not other things that he's doing,</v>

511
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

512
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.810
<v Speaker 4>spending more resources on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

513
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.480
<v Speaker 4>on human intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

514
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.493
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's something that gets talked </v>

515
00:20:33.551 --> 00:20:37.120
<v Speaker 4>about and is done in cycles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So after nine slash 11,</v>

516
00:20:37.121 --> 00:20:37.931
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

517
00:20:37.931 --> 00:20:40.510
<v Speaker 4>suddenly George Tenet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the director at the time was instructed,</v>

518
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.180
<v Speaker 4>you got to get more officers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get more Kadra.</v>

519
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.043
<v Speaker 4>We gotta recruit people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't just rely on signals in </v>

520
00:20:46.301 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 4>intercepts and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

521
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that happens over a period of time.</v>

522
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.970
<v Speaker 4>He's talking about revamping the Dni or </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you know,</v>

523
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 4>taking it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

524
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:58.700
<v Speaker 4>that's been talked about for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

525
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 4>the Dni was put together after nine </v>
<v Speaker 4>slash 11.</v>

526
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big layer of bureaucracy,</v>

527
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.550
<v Speaker 4>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So some of the things he's told,</v>

528
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 4>what does that stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dni,</v>

529
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 4>director of national intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

530
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.663
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

531
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 4>James Clapper was the previous guy going</v>
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>

532
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm a run of that and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting because the Dni was no,</v>

533
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 4>from Mike Flynn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is now the national security guy.</v>

534
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a rocky relationship with,</v>

535
00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.693
<v Speaker 4>with the Dni and it feels like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically pushed him out of his last </v>

536
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.104
<v Speaker 4>position in the Intel community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it'll be interesting to see how he </v>

537
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 4>deals with this issue of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do we restructure.</v>

538
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 4>But I guess my point being is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

539
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:35.410
<v Speaker 4>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really have a dog in the hunt,</v>

540
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was trump my preferred candidate?</v>

541
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

542
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:40.660
<v Speaker 4>but now he's the president and we from </v>
<v Speaker 4>my point of view,</v>

543
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.330
<v Speaker 4>now you want it to work now you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything possible.</v>

544
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 4>But just like with anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look for the good and you say that's</v>

545
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:48.200
<v Speaker 4>great and if something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

546
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 4>you don't agree with whether you can say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that too.</v>

547
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 4>We got that right in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

548
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to agree with every single</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that any president does.</v>

549
00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 4>We can disagree with the policies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't have to slag people off.</v>

550
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 4>And if I veer off and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

551
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.513
<v Speaker 4>I don't think a president trump should </v>
<v Speaker 4>have veered off and talked about </v>

552
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:07.294
<v Speaker 4>inauguration numbers in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he was standing there in our lobby </v>

553
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 4>in front of the stars on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

554
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get a,</v>

555
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:15.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of hundred tweets,</v>

556
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

557
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking idiot.</v>

558
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 4>How could you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

559
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I say it because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

560
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.131
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

561
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

562
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.620
<v Speaker 4>how is that somehow insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

563
00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:24.454
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to like some of the things </v>

564
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 4>that he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to like some of the things</v>

565
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 4>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way it works,</v>

566
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You find it.</v>

567
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very down a rabbit hole right now,</v>

568
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's because I get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting pissed off because,</v>

569
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.243
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've seem to have gotten away from the </v>

570
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:38.130
<v Speaker 4>idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

571
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.640
<v Speaker 4>nobody's perfect.</v>

572
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody that's a,</v>

573
00:22:40.841 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 4>that's a dyed in the wool trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporter right now,</v>

574
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who for the past eight years,</v>

575
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 4>hated the fact that Obama supporters </v>
<v Speaker 4>were adoring of him and said,</v>

576
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 4>everything he does is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're,</v>

577
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of those folks doing the same thing</v>

578
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:55.390
<v Speaker 4>with the new president and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

579
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.280
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

580
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy she didn't win.</v>

581
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm ecstatic that Hillary Clinton didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>win frankly.</v>

582
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.823
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that I've got to </v>

583
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 4>now stand up and say everything Donald </v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump does is great.</v>

584
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do that with any troubling </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you about her.</v>

585
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

586
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Where do we begin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

587
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 4>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

588
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm obviously,</v>

589
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to pick my words carefully </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

590
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm trying to be diplomatic.</v>

591
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 4>I think she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

592
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like what I perceived as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

593
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lack of,</v>

594
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.010
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

595
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.843
<v Speaker 4>of character.</v>

596
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like what I perceived as not </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

597
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.260
<v Speaker 4>and here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like either of the candidates.</v>

598
00:23:45.261 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 4>Neither candidate was my choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the candidate was,</v>

599
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the candidate was my,</v>

600
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.120
<v Speaker 4>I'd have a dog in the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I looked at her,</v>

601
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 4>I just felt like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't anything there.</v>

602
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 4>And I felt like we had the past eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

603
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 4>I felt like with the previous president </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

604
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:03.314
<v Speaker 4>I liked some of the things he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like some of the stuff that he </v>

605
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:05.834
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was always concerned that he </v>

606
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:11.900
<v Speaker 4>didn't have a principles that he stood </v>
<v Speaker 4>on that he said,</v>

607
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

608
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.740
<v Speaker 4>this is where I draw the line and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is what,</v>

609
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 4>these are my principles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I believe in.</v>

610
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.193
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I felt like she was similar in that </v>

611
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

612
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.673
<v Speaker 4>And I think we've just had enough of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of that bend in the wind and do </v>

613
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:25.484
<v Speaker 4>whatever we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This country's lost a lot of leverage </v>

614
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 4>overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if,</v>

615
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 4>and I know people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

616
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:31.820
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't be the police person around</v>

617
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what the fucking truth is?</v>

618
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:34.814
<v Speaker 4>Somebody has got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we're not at the top of the food </v>

619
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:37.850
<v Speaker 4>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

620
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.610
<v Speaker 4>We can step off because we want to build</v>
<v Speaker 4>more roads here and we want to spend our</v>

621
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 4>money here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I get that.</v>

622
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 4>And that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if we're not,</v>

623
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.620
<v Speaker 4>if somebody is not at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food chain,</v>

624
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 4>somebody else will try or it'll be </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>

625
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 4>And what's a vacuum?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not a community of nations that</v>

626
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 4>gathers together and acts in a global </v>
<v Speaker 4>community spirit.</v>

627
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

628
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.073
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our interests don't align very often </v>

629
00:24:57.651 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 4>with other countries.</v>

630
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.820
<v Speaker 4>We have certain allies where it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

631
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.950
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how it works.</v>

632
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:06.440
<v Speaker 4>It's chaos out there and it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>nasty at times.</v>

633
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:07.274
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm a big believer in yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we shouldn't be out there policing </v>

634
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:12.890
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to need to and we should</v>

635
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.023
<v Speaker 4>want to be at the top of the heap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well definitely doesn't seem as any </v>

636
00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:16.904
<v Speaker 4>benevolent superpower that's looking out</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the world's best interests outside </v>

637
00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:19.951
<v Speaker 4>of us know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

638
00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:20.231
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

639
00:25:20.231 --> 00:25:21.370
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people raise their eyes,</v>

640
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you say something like that.</v>

641
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.450
<v Speaker 4>And I agree with that percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People roll their eyes and they go,</v>

642
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 4>I bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

643
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.970
<v Speaker 4>it's out there and then what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

644
00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:30.804
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are they?</v>

645
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

646
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.210
<v Speaker 4>And I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

647
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.043
<v Speaker 3>And I get those feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand where those people are </v>

648
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:37.180
<v Speaker 3>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get this idea of anti-globalization,</v>

649
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I'd get this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

650
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

651
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 3>they're anti the whole idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military industrial complex,</v>

652
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Speaker 3>controlling all the resources of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

653
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand,</v>

654
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 3>but know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some bad countries out there,</v>

655
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.260
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not bad people,</v>

656
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.303
<v Speaker 3>but countries that are run by dictators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries that are run by extremely </v>

657
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:00.464
<v Speaker 3>ruthless people and a lot of them have </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to some significant military </v>

658
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:05.780
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

659
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're absolutely right.</v>

660
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a course.</v>

661
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 4>We make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously we make mistakes,</v>

662
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.490
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

663
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I spent almost all my life overseas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

664
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I spent a long time peeking behind the </v>
<v Speaker 4>curtain and we see,</v>

665
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 4>we try to self correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We may take a wrong turn,</v>

666
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 4>we may do something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

667
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:24.860
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine that the site doesn't work it out,</v>

668
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.993
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we tend to try to do the things for the </v>

669
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:32.390
<v Speaker 4>right reason regardless of which </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration it is,</v>

670
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.283
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

671
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.400
<v Speaker 4>and just as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

672
00:26:35.401 --> 00:26:36.000
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

673
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.090
<v Speaker 4>as a principle guiding principle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

674
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.850
<v Speaker 4>and maybe people hear that and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think you don't want a fucking idiot.</v>

675
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how it works,</v>

676
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:43.310
<v Speaker 4>but that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

677
00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:44.144
<v Speaker 4>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's everybody has to speak according </v>

678
00:26:45.101 --> 00:26:45.934
<v Speaker 4>to their own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My experience is that most of my </v>

679
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.843
<v Speaker 4>childhood and adult life overseas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a lot of weird shit and I've </v>

680
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 4>been to a lot of difficult places and </v>
<v Speaker 4>America stands.</v>

681
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

682
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 4>a few allies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Brits,</v>

683
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm partial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a dual citizen,</v>

684
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:07.040
<v Speaker 4>but the Brits are right there with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

685

<v Speaker 4>Canadians who doesn't let the Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

686

<v Speaker 4>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

687
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.263
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a small community there that </v>

688
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 4>tries to be principal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tries to do the right thing,</v>

689
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.993
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else out there as acting </v>

690
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.243
<v Speaker 4>purely on their own best interest and </v>
<v Speaker 4>our interest and there's almost never </v>

691
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:28.521
<v Speaker 4>align whether it's Russia or in parts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe or wherever it may be,</v>

692
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:30.370
<v Speaker 4>Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

693
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.283
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody got somebody to be at the top </v>

694
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 4>of the food chain and I just prefer to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be us.</v>

695
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

696
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's massive criticisms.</v>

697
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.980
<v Speaker 2>The United States and a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>valid.</v>

698
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.843
<v Speaker 2>It makes a lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's human beings are just </v>

699
00:27:44.481 --> 00:27:45.860
<v Speaker 2>flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

700
00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:49.250
<v Speaker 2>this is the most recent country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the newest country,</v>

701
00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:53.060
<v Speaker 2>and this is the only country that exists</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

702
00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:55.910
<v Speaker 2>this experiment in self government that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists today.</v>

703
00:27:55.911 --> 00:27:58.790
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing like it out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you look into it,</v>

704
00:27:58.791 --> 00:27:59.624
<v Speaker 2>you have a much more intense and deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of it than I ever will </v>

705
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.303
<v Speaker 2>because of your experience in life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different places that you've </v>

706
00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:07.490
<v Speaker 2>been in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that you've seen,</v>

707
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the rest of the world,</v>

708
00:28:11.361 --> 00:28:12.194
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing remotely similar to </v>

709
00:28:13.731 --> 00:28:15.950
<v Speaker 2>what's going on over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a crazy place.</v>

710
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.023
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy place as far as innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy places as far as creativity and </v>

711
00:28:20.391 --> 00:28:23.510
<v Speaker 2>art and film and comedy and music and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

712
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.980
<v Speaker 2>There's so much bubbling in this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the world and,</v>

713
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.391
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

714
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:29.570
<v Speaker 2>and liberties and freedoms and exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>

715
00:28:29.571 --> 00:28:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I made it great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

716
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.690
<v Speaker 2>like the protest on inauguration day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

717
00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:33.524
<v Speaker 2>Go Out and protest that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fucking go blow up a limo to no </v>

718
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.230
<v Speaker 2>fucking chairs through starbucks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>

719
00:28:39.231 --> 00:28:40.820
<v Speaker 2>They did a lot of stupid shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

720
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:41.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a small,</v>

721
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small group and that's fine and it's </v>

722
00:28:43.911 --> 00:28:46.170
<v Speaker 2>going to happen I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

723
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.083
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're out there talking about </v>

724
00:28:47.781 --> 00:28:50.240
<v Speaker 2>oppression and being oppressed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

725
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.580
<v Speaker 2>my thought is always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think,</v>

726
00:28:52.581 --> 00:28:53.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we should do,</v>

727
00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:55.520
<v Speaker 2>we should reenact a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard</v>

728
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.603
<v Speaker 4>Tori service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody should have to serve two </v>

729
00:28:58.161 --> 00:28:58.994
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in the military or some </v>

730
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.513
<v Speaker 4>international component where you go </v>
<v Speaker 4>overseas and you spent a little bit of </v>

731
00:29:04.551 --> 00:29:07.420
<v Speaker 4>time in some shit hole and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see</v>

732
00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.253
<v Speaker 2>how bad it is and how bad it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all these people that walk around </v>

733
00:29:11.231 --> 00:29:12.310
<v Speaker 2>here and talk but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I get it,</v>

734
00:29:12.311 --> 00:29:14.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could do better with better course.</v>

735
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.440
<v Speaker 2>We can do better in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>

736
00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but we need perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

737
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:20.981
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

738
00:29:20.981 --> 00:29:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a balanced perspective.</v>

739
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.373
<v Speaker 2>How did it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this was what was confusing to </v>

740
00:29:24.971 --> 00:29:27.490
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did the FBI in and now originally,</v>

741
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.880
<v Speaker 2>eventually the FBI came around to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>CIA's conclusions,</v>

742
00:29:30.881 --> 00:29:31.714
<v Speaker 2>but for a long time the FBI was </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreeing with the CIA about whether </v>

743
00:29:34.871 --> 00:29:37.420
<v Speaker 2>or not the Russians had anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with hacking the DNC.</v>

744
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big.</v>

745
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I think the big disagreement was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>over</v>

746
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was a big part.</v>

747
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.183
<v Speaker 4>It was an evidence based thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't see any evidence that the </v>

748
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:47.914
<v Speaker 4>Russians were involved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which eventually became clear and now </v>

749
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 4>there was a arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an arrest,</v>

750
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.500
<v Speaker 4>an unprecedented arrest a couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

751
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

752
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.053
<v Speaker 4>Well I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you also talked about two different </v>

753
00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:57.184
<v Speaker 4>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the bureau is the FBI as a law </v>

754
00:29:58.841 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 4>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when they look at something,</v>

755
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 4>they're looking at it from a law </v>
<v Speaker 4>enforcement perspective.</v>

756
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:05.980
<v Speaker 4>They're looking at gathering sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence to prove a case.</v>

757
00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Basically that's how they look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>agencies and Intel operation and so they</v>

758
00:30:09.861 --> 00:30:11.790
<v Speaker 4>are get Gavin pieces of information </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

759
00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not an evidentiary chain thing,</v>

760
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 4>so let's just get the preponderance of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Intel.</v>

761
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Let's see where it leads as some of it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be conflicting,</v>

762
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 4>some of it's not well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well sourced,</v>

763
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 4>but let's all see what it tells us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

764
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 4>and so part of it is how they approach a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reaching a conclusion,</v>

765
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.383
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were both going to get to the same </v>

766
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 4>place because he eventually there they </v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down and they compare notes.</v>

767
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.733
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but part of it was the difference of </v>

768
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 4>opinion over the motivation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation is the toughest thing.</v>

769
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.280
<v Speaker 4>One of the toughest things approved in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

770
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this business and intelligence,</v>

771
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can say,</v>

772
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:46.301
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did this,</v>

773
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:47.134
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you've got a sore sitting in the </v>

774
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:49.264
<v Speaker 4>tent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was there and part of the </v>

775
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 4>conversation when somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

776
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why,</v>

777
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:53.764
<v Speaker 4>or this is how we're going to do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a reason to it without that </v>

778
00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:57.960
<v Speaker 4>sort of sourcing or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

779
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.010
<v Speaker 4>intercepts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

780
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's tough to prove motivation.</v>

781
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.730
<v Speaker 4>So it took a while to kind of get around</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that notion.</v>

782
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:05.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be honest,</v>

783
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still a little bit up in the air,</v>

784
00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:09.110
<v Speaker 4>we're probably never going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless again,</v>

785
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 4>we get our hands on a really quality </v>
<v Speaker 4>good source,</v>

786
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that may still be a little bit up in the</v>

787
00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:14.494
<v Speaker 4>air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the bottom line is the restaurant </v>

788
00:31:14.881 --> 00:31:15.714
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians were engaged in doing what </v>

789
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 4>they always do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>covert action,</v>

790
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:20.830
<v Speaker 4>propaganda campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it may be.</v>

791
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 4>There's the 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot view was always the same.</v>

792
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 4>They want it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to.</v>

793
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 4>So a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

794
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of mistrust.</v>

795
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:29.164
<v Speaker 4>They want to create some chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to kind of chip away at the </v>

796
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:32.284
<v Speaker 4>belief that democracy is a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they did look how much time was </v>

797
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:36.514
<v Speaker 4>spent talking about the integrity of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>election system and whether we actually </v>

798
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:41.140
<v Speaker 4>had a legitimate president or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a win.</v>

799
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.450
<v Speaker 4>So you've got a couple of colonels in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the FSB,</v>

800
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.343
<v Speaker 4>which was the old kgb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who undoubtedly have been promoted as a </v>

801
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:48.004
<v Speaker 4>result of that operation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And who got someone got arrested from </v>

802
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:52.420
<v Speaker 4>the FSB,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was that guy?</v>

803
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interested.</v>

804
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't have those details in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

805
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:59.761
<v Speaker 4>I just did some token guy that pistol </v>
<v Speaker 4>potent exactly when the fucking hall for</v>

806
00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just said the wrong thing,</v>

807
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's unprecedented.</v>

808
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:05.853
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they never have politically arrest </v>

809
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:09.220
<v Speaker 4>there guys like um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they,</v>

810
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 4>they have for certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for corruption issues.</v>

811
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.740
<v Speaker 4>If they get sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

812
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:16.810
<v Speaker 4>from a internal arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

813
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:17.644
<v Speaker 4>then you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

814
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It usually doesn't make the news because</v>

815
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:22.570
<v Speaker 4>nobody really gives a shit outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia and they do now because of this,</v>

816
00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 4>because of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because people want to talk about it.</v>

817
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:26.920
<v Speaker 4>And what bothered me about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

818
00:32:26.921 --> 00:32:27.754
<v Speaker 4>but what bothered me about this was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative because the narrative was </v>

819
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:31.024
<v Speaker 4>Russia hacked the elections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody kept saying and </v>

820
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:33.634
<v Speaker 4>that's what all these Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these left wing people were saying to </v>

821
00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:39.130
<v Speaker 4>try to pump up this idea that trump was </v>
<v Speaker 4>not a legitimate president.</v>

822
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>Russia hacked</v>

823
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 2>the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia hacked the election,</v>

824
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 2>will know someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Russia,</v>

825
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.463
<v Speaker 2>whoever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that information out that the DNC </v>

826
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.783
<v Speaker 2>had sent through private emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the information was what they sent </v>

827
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

828
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't hack anything.</v>

829
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 2>They didn't get into any election </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

830
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.323
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get into the voting </v>

831
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:00.854
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do anything other than </v>

832
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:05.300
<v Speaker 2>release information that was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be private.</v>

833
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 2>That indicated a bunch of really shady </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

834
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

835
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those,</v>

836
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.220
<v Speaker 2>all those Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how pissed off once you'd be if,</v>

837
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 2>if you're a Bernie sanders supporter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're burning himself fucked over.</v>

838
00:33:15.531 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 2>He got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

839
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seemed to have made peace.</v>

840
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:18.224
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a politician that even though he </v>

841
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:20.400
<v Speaker 2>says he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

842
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just a weirdly principled one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

843
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.450
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

844
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I know Bernie would have been a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>

845
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.723
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernie would have won a Joe </v>
<v Speaker 2>Biden would have been a better </v>

846
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:31.600
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

847
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.713
<v Speaker 2>you always liked the person sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bench and then they get in the race </v>

848
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:34.850
<v Speaker 2>and they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

849
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

850
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.000
<v Speaker 2>They might have dug up some shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those guys,</v>

851
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:38.834
<v Speaker 2>but Bernie was an interesting guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a whole lot of people that are in </v>

852
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 2>his position for as long as he is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the kind of principles he has.</v>

853
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.740
<v Speaker 2>When he was able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

854
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 2>why don't you release the transcripts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different speeches you gave to</v>

855
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:52.970
<v Speaker 2>all these banks that you got paid a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter million dollars and he goes,</v>

856
00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I will happily release mine because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any because I wouldn't take a</v>

857
00:33:56.241 --> 00:33:57.074
<v Speaker 2>penny from those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on a whole lot of people can say </v>

858
00:33:58.821 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that in a big debate and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

859
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:04.520
<v Speaker 2>they rallied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got together and they,</v>

860
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.300
<v Speaker 2>they decided to rig the primaries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've rigged it.</v>

861
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.790
<v Speaker 2>They really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what the Russians exposed,</v>

862
00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:13.370
<v Speaker 2>but it Debbie Wasserman Schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a real piece of work,</v>

863
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.190
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

864
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

865
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.840
<v Speaker 2>so I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're right now,</v>

866
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess what obviously what people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that on,</v>

867
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the far left side are saying is well,</v>

868
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 2>but without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they hadn't released that information</v>

869
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:26.770
<v Speaker 2>then it would have been a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballgame.</v>

870
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.653
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we wouldn't know how fucking </v>

871
00:34:29.331 --> 00:34:30.164
<v Speaker 2>corrupt she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't know the Debbie Wasserman </v>

872
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.073
<v Speaker 2>Schultz had done what she'd done and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn't have </v>

873
00:34:34.251 --> 00:34:35.084
<v Speaker 2>gotten fired from the DNC and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately got hired by Hillary's </v>

874
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

875
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean they picked her up in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes while she obviously they want to</v>

876
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 2>keep her happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

877
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.473
<v Speaker 2>when somebody's walking out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization with a chip on their </v>

878
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:47.144
<v Speaker 2>shoulder talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So especially after what she did for </v>

879
00:34:49.581 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

880
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean they rigged the primaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really did.</v>

881
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.210
<v Speaker 2>And people should be upset about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way more than anything else.</v>

882
00:34:56.211 --> 00:35:00.400
<v Speaker 2>This idea that Russia did something when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expose something that you should,</v>

883
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 2>that we should have known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should've known about it because it's</v>

884
00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 2>a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

885
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:05.810
<v Speaker 2>that kind of corruptions essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collusion.</v>

886
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a conspiracy.</v>

887
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a real conspiracy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

888
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:10.754
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're interrupting a democratic </v>

889
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 2>process and that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

890
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.553
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was far more so than an </v>

891
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:21.130
<v Speaker 2>outside force doing what you expect them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do anyway,</v>

892
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.240
<v Speaker 2>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the Russians did.</v>

893
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:24.190
<v Speaker 2>They always do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

894
00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.093
<v Speaker 2>So I think it would've been a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How interesting would those </v>

895
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 2>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in,</v>

896
00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

897
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.083
<v Speaker 2>in the Kremlin or at FSB headquarters </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're talking about this and </v>

898
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning it.</v>

899
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Someone had to write a note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

900
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Someone had to sit and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

901
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.203
<v Speaker 2>I got an idea for an operation and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had it because they're a bureaucracy </v>

902
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:46.194
<v Speaker 2>like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they would have had to sit and </v>

903
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:52.360
<v Speaker 2>figure this out and then it would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>made its way to Putin because,</v>

904
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this obviously the concern over the </v>

905
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:59.061
<v Speaker 2>blowback and the publicity of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Putin clearly knew what was going on,</v>

906
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it works.</v>

907
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Stalin new back in the day knew exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing,</v>

908
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:05.304
<v Speaker 2>trying to influence public opinion here </v>
<v Speaker 2>back during the early world war one or </v>

909
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:09.830
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

910
00:36:09.831 --> 00:36:10.664
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no surprise the Chinese do the </v>

911
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 2>same thing every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

912
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 2>every nation that's got the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean hell,</v>

913
00:36:15.061 --> 00:36:16.050
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we do it too.</v>

914
00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:16.681
<v Speaker 2>People always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

915
00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

916
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:17.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

917
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 2>of course we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we don't all do it.</v>

919
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.383
<v Speaker 2>It's half of the weird competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on and you better hope we </v>

920
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense,</v>

921
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I always say the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people say,</v>

922
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

923
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 2>a cyber hacking or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

924
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.651
<v Speaker 2>People always go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

925
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 2>well you don't have any right to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US does it as well.</v>

926
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

927
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.443
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a good thing given how </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and how nasty the world is </v>

928
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:44.120
<v Speaker 2>out there and how we're constantly being</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit and attacked out in cyberspace.</v>

929
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

930
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 2>we better hope we're good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

931
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.713
<v Speaker 2>if people knew how often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how consistently and constantly our </v>

932
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.653
<v Speaker 2>commercial and a public sector </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure is probed and tested and </v>

933
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:01.320
<v Speaker 2>attacked on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People wouldn't sleep at night.</v>

934
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.170
<v Speaker 2>All the have is watch a showtime series </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeland.</v>

935
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:06.830
<v Speaker 2>It's super accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

936
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 2>How you ever watch that show.</v>

937
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.353
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch a lot of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good person to watch shows </v>

938
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:12.144
<v Speaker 2>like that with my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my wife tells me that all the </v>

939
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:14.040
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

940
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be like be watching those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A karate movies.</v>

941
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

942
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chronic yet of course.</v>

943
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was legit as fuck.</v>

944
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.220
<v Speaker 2>But like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the movie warrior.</v>

945
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.143
<v Speaker 2>I got mad at that movie and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fight two days in a row like </v>

946
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:26.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

947
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Although they did do that in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

948
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Crazy assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan at a tournament,</v>

949
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I think they fought three days in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

950
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 2>it's appendix to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck in Japan.</v>

951
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.320
<v Speaker 2>They just go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put together this woman,</v>

952
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Gabby Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's six foot three,</v>

953
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might be.</v>

954
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.833
<v Speaker 2>She's at least six to Jesus solid to 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they put her in the ring with a 50 </v>

955
00:37:50.611 --> 00:37:54.060
<v Speaker 2>year old woman who had bad knees and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the shit out of.</v>

956
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Is that you dinging?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that man.</v>

957
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:57.923
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

958
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Put that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they put her in with this,</v>

959
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:03.054
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman who is literally 50 years </v>

960
00:38:04.771 --> 00:38:05.604
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's about five feet tall and Gary </v>

961
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Garcia ran over her like a train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

962
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.370
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't care.</v>

963
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Japan will have crazy fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have freak show fights.</v>

964
00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:14.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

965
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:14.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

966
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 2>look at all the shows that have come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of there to be there.</v>

967
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:17.773
<v Speaker 2>All the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the weird shit that ends up on our </v>

968
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:23.661
<v Speaker 2>tvs usually comes from Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the big arguments was that the</v>

969
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:24.984
<v Speaker 2>Russians definitely wanted trump to win </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they didn't then they would </v>

970
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 2>have hacked the RNC and they would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>released their emails too.</v>

971
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.793
<v Speaker 2>But that's a hard argument to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know that they said </v>

972
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>anything inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know</v>

973
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 4>that there was any collusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

974
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:42.751
<v Speaker 4>and there was also a attempts to hack </v>
<v Speaker 4>the RNC and the RNC as would one company</v>

975
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.164
<v Speaker 4>to the next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not every company is running the same </v>

976
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 4>security protocols on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure.</v>

977
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 4>So the RNC had different security </v>
<v Speaker 4>protocols on their infrastructure and,</v>

978
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were,</v>

979
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they not hacked,</v>

980
00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but they were tested and the tech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

981
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that idea that they wanted,</v>

982
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 4>they wanted trump to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frankly,</v>

983
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.993
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Putin sat there and thought to </v>

984
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:05.981
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

985
00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 4>what I want is what's in my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Russia's best interest,</v>

986
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.740
<v Speaker 4>well then I'm going to go with a known </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantity.</v>

987
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go with Hillary Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I know what I got there.</v>

988
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.053
<v Speaker 4>And it's not tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But trump was like pro Putin and he's </v>

989
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 4>basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Putin's a smart guy.</v>

990
00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Putin's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do deals together.</v>

991
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.920
<v Speaker 4>We can have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's too smart.</v>

992
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.873
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to take that on face </v>

993
00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:26.494
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>

994
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.363
<v Speaker 4>he knows he's reading all the same shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and watching all the same shit that </v>

995
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 4>everybody else's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that trump is in the past.</v>

996
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:33.544
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of been all president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump has been all over the place and </v>

997
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:39.020
<v Speaker 4>talked in different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's not as if potent would here.</v>

998
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:39.671
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

999
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 4>he likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1000
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.563
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not like that.</v>

1001
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet wicker be fresh.</v>

1002
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:43.864
<v Speaker 4>And so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just a what's best for my best </v>

1003
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:47.980
<v Speaker 4>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1004
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.173
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go that route business as </v>

1005
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 4>usual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>business as usual,</v>

1006
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:52.294
<v Speaker 4>and I know I'm not going to get any </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushback for the shit that I do because </v>

1007
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 4>she is just going to continue the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that have been happening.</v>

1008
00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.320
<v Speaker 4>They're going to continue to withdraw </v>
<v Speaker 4>off the world stage.</v>

1009
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.650
<v Speaker 4>And this idea that Somehow Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton was a warmonger,</v>

1010
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 4>what the hell that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where did that come from?</v>

1011
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

1012
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not necessarily buying the idea that</v>

1013
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:11.980
<v Speaker 4>trump or that a Putin one president </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump to win.</v>

1014
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.063
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've thought that he wanted them </v>

1015
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:15.643
<v Speaker 4>to win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to throw democracy into the </v>

1016
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:18.004
<v Speaker 4>shitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to fucking throw a big monkey </v>

1017
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:20.224
<v Speaker 4>wrench into the gears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He probably felt that a trump victory </v>

1018
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:23.880
<v Speaker 4>would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:40:23.881 --> 00:40:24.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1020
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 4>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a possibility there.</v>

1021
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1022
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.880
<v Speaker 4>Putin is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an interesting cat and I just,</v>

1023
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.360
<v Speaker 4>I just have a feeling though that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1024
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.270
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make these,</v>

1025
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1026
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.793
<v Speaker 4>these decisions based on what's in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own best interests and I think they </v>

1027
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 4>would look at the track record of Obama.</v>

1028
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.140
<v Speaker 4>They would look at her track record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would look at an unknown quantity,</v>

1029
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:44.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1030
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:47.680
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to buy what he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>says on the surface.</v>

1031
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.541
<v Speaker 4>It's just not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1032
00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:49.374
<v Speaker 4>it's not that there wouldn't be as </v>
<v Speaker 4>simple as that and they would look and </v>

1033
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:52.774
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1034
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 4>let's go with what we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1035
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.010
<v Speaker 4>because we know we can steamroll that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1036
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 4>and this over here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't know now what was.</v>

1037
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 4>So what was the point of them meddling </v>
<v Speaker 4>and doing what they did.</v>

1038
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:03.881
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1039
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:04.714
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just trying to create </v>

1040
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:08.340
<v Speaker 4>instability chaos in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1041
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.553
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of sense of mistrust of a </v>

1042
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 4>democratic institution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1043
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:17.761
<v Speaker 4>how much of a factor do you think it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Hillary was not ever prosecuted for</v>

1044
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 4>deleting all those emails after </v>
<v Speaker 4>subpoena?</v>

1045
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 4>Because it seems like that in any other </v>
<v Speaker 4>case,</v>

1046
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 4>if you do something like that top secret</v>
<v Speaker 4>clearance,</v>

1047
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.513
<v Speaker 4>you're found to have violated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He deleted those emails and people are </v>

1048
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>tired</v>

1049
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 2>of hearing about this from the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>though can still bringing that up again,</v>

1050
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.323
<v Speaker 2>but I got to think that in light of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said about them trying to hack into </v>

1051
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:41.444
<v Speaker 2>the RNC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no evidence of they actually gotten </v>

1052
00:41:42.521 --> 00:41:43.354
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did get into the DNC and you </v>

1053
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 2>think about all the different security </v>
<v Speaker 2>errors that they've made.</v>

1054
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Especially with her having that private </v>
<v Speaker 2>email server and all that shit with homo</v>

1055
00:41:50.851 --> 00:41:51.684
<v Speaker 2>was using the same goddamn computer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>printer that Anthony we're sending as </v>

1056
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Dick pics out on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1057
00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's chaos.</v>

1058
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't have written that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Sitcom on house of cards,</v>

1059
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you would have gone love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going over the top.</v>

1060
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.010
<v Speaker 2>That's not believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're jumping the shark.</v>

1061
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.823
<v Speaker 2>As opposed to when the secret service </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents slept with the president and his </v>

1063
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:11.354
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1064
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 2>there was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

1065
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.361
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave it.</v>

1066
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 2>That's when I gave up on the series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does Not that far yet.</v>

1067
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son of a bitch.</v>

1068
00:42:19.551 --> 00:42:20.384
<v Speaker 2>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was son of a bitch and already won </v>

1069
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we rewind that goddamn spoilers,</v>

1070
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.190
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1071
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.733
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to go home and get myself </v>

1072
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:30.080
<v Speaker 2>in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I try to forget that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1074
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.780
<v Speaker 2>I just made that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't actually appreciate it.</v>

1075
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Seasoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's got it now?</v>

1076
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Who's Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting.</v>

1077
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.660
<v Speaker 2>It would have just sitting there waiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fucking three service.</v>

1078
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Sleeping with a resident wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1079
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 2>That'd be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1080
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's already done.</v>

1081
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Some gay shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird show.</v>

1083
00:42:51.601 --> 00:42:52.670
<v Speaker 2>But that was the point where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1084
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:54.470
<v Speaker 2>I gotta find myself another program to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

1085
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1086
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.261
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1087
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:58.094
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1088
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.640
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you were like,</v>

1089
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.030
<v Speaker 2>this is unrealistic now.</v>

1090
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:02.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice that,</v>

1091
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that's that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I draw the line.</v>

1092
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere at all,</v>

1093
00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:08.024
<v Speaker 2>the presidents that we've had somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a secret service agent has slipped it </v>

1094
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 2>into the missus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you,</v>

1095
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you somewhere along the line</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody fucked the president's wife.</v>

1096
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it was taft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the tafts.</v>

1097
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Administratively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have done it.</v>

1098
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are savages.</v>

1099
00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Back then people were barely human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were cave men with clothes on.</v>

1100
00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back shit.</v>

1101
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:32.903
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A female secret service agent who said </v>

1102
00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:35.234
<v Speaker 2>she was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't take a bullet for the </v>

1103
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1104
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's your job.</v>

1105
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:39.861
<v Speaker 2>Hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1106
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:42.350
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a fire yet.</v>

1107
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Not yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1108
00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:44.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1109
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:44.781
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1110
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:45.614
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that she will be disciplined </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're saying she went on </v>

1111
00:43:49.341 --> 00:43:50.174
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she put it on our facebook profile and </v>

1112
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>was a good move.</v>

1113
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she supported,</v>

1114
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 2>openly supported Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that on facebook and said that she,</v>

1115
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.710
<v Speaker 2>she would not take a bullet for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for president trump.</v>

1116
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:01.461
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1117
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in the secret service.</v>

1118
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>That's your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1119
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:05.720
<v Speaker 2>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outrage at women,</v>

1120
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:07.610
<v Speaker 2>secret service agent and Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporter,</v>

1121
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 2>who said she would not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capital letters risk her life to protect</v>

1122
00:44:11.481 --> 00:44:12.314
<v Speaker 2>president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secret Service Agent Carrie O'grady </v>

1123
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.990
<v Speaker 2>wrote last October that she would rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to jail.</v>

1124
00:44:17.991 --> 00:44:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Then take a bullet for Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1125
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.980
<v Speaker 2>she definitely get a better job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1126
00:44:22.981 --> 00:44:23.241
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1127
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He removed the post days later.</v>

1128
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:25.993
<v Speaker 2>Said she wrote it after being overcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>with emotion following trump's grabbed </v>

1129
00:44:28.901 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 2>them by the pussy video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a music video.</v>

1130
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like a two live crew music video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She insists that she would be willing to</v>

1131
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 2>do anything to protect the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but o'grady has also made numerous other</v>

1132
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 2>post criticizing Donald Trump.</v>

1133
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1134
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 2>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite sure I understand the.</v>

1135
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:47.101
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1136
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:47.934
<v Speaker 2>the conflict there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said she would rather go to jail to </v>

1137
00:44:50.051 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 2>take a bullet for the Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>president trump,</v>

1138
00:44:52.471 --> 00:44:53.304
<v Speaker 2>and then she insisted she would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do anything to protect the </v>

1139
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:55.081
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1140
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:55.914
<v Speaker 2>now she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She removed it and wants to keep her </v>

1141
00:44:58.321 --> 00:44:59.154
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secret services that are looking into </v>

1142
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 2>the post after a complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a dangerous position to take.</v>

1143
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:05.424
<v Speaker 2>If you are a secret service agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about someone who's a </v>

1144
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.533
<v Speaker 2>WHO's a just regular civilian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about someone who's Dad </v>

1145
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.800
<v Speaker 2>your whole job and you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be mean or she's in Denver.</v>

1146
00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:19.561
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

1147
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that she's been with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them for quite a while.</v>

1148
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Like she knows better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time for.</v>

1149
00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1150
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.520
<v Speaker 2>that's dishonoring the service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret service and you know what?</v>

1151
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Maybe A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they'll,</v>

1152
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 2>they'll icer put her in some admin </v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

1153
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 2>but you have to in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1154
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:35.350
<v Speaker 2>If you're a secret service agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1155
00:45:35.351 --> 00:45:39.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't say anything critical like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that publicly about the president.</v>

1156
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:40.643
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diminishes the entire position that you </v>

1157
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you retire,</v>

1158
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:44.514
<v Speaker 2>you could say whatever the fuck you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>without violating any sort of laws that </v>

1159
00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:49.231
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1160
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:51.150
<v Speaker 2>any sort of agreement that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>signed.</v>

1161
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 2>But once you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the job.</v>

1162
00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1163
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you were in the agency and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're overseas and you were campaigning</v>

1164
00:45:57.211 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 2>on behalf of one of the candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1165
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:01.490
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1166
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.423
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed with her understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social media by posting something like </v>

1167
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:05.634
<v Speaker 2>that on facebook that she was overcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>with emotion though coming to motions </v>

1168
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:09.083
<v Speaker 2>for the outer period will get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she had a xanax and a glass of </v>

1169
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>

1170
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.733
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that orange asshole and just grab </v>

1171
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:17.100
<v Speaker 2>them by the pushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

1172
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a weird time though that,</v>

1173
00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:22.580
<v Speaker 2>that guy actually said that and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to let they.</v>

1174
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how much people didn't want </v>

1175
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton to be an office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1176
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.390

1179
00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:35.604
<v Speaker 2>around at the inauguration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the inauguration stand of Bill </v>

1210
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:49.924
<v Speaker 2>when the only bright spot I guess I </v>

1211
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 2>spot to her wedding would have been that</v>

1231
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:45.724
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely been responsible for </v>

1232
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 2>people dying as president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 100 percent.</v>

<v Speaker 2>jazz them up,</v>

1274
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.900
<v Speaker 2>but back then I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.790
<v Speaker 2>it's normally get your doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write you a prescription to hear you.</v>

1276
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 2>This will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will make you feel better.</v>

1277
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:39.281
<v Speaker 2>This throwing Mama's little helper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her mother's little helper momma went up</v>

1278
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:42.710
<v Speaker 2>from the south.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1279
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:45.170
<v Speaker 2>it's the position is such a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1280
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:46.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one that's really qualified </v>

1281
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 2>to do it and every time someone gets in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1282
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:50.384
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what kind of flaws and your </v>

1283
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 2>character going to be revealed by this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that case,</v>

1284
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:54.884
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least from the point of view of </v>

1285
00:50:57.411 --> 00:51:01.400
<v Speaker 2>representing a stately sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 2>like an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate leader.</v>

1287
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Obama did a great job in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No measured.</v>

1288
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 2>That's why the people on the left lobe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because he,</v>

1289
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.950
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the,</v>

1290
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the projection of the intellect.</v>

1291
00:51:13.231 --> 00:51:14.080
<v Speaker 2>He was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1292
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:15.380
<v Speaker 2>and fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was,</v>

1293
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:16.214
<v Speaker 2>he was at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in a sort of one of those folks </v>

1294
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you look at and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our president,</v>

1295
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put again,</v>

1296
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you could say he did certain things.</v>

1297
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:23.953
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say from a foreign policy </v>

1298
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.820
<v Speaker 2>perspective it was not good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1299
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:29.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be able to say that was good </v>

1300
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and there's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1301
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.633
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I'm worried about with </v>

1302
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 2>the new president is that I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that all those borders aren't just</v>

1303
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:39.710
<v Speaker 2>going to say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything he does,</v>

1304
00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:41.970
<v Speaker 2>it's good that you still got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they always do that.</v>

1305
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody starts on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I talking?</v>

1306
00:51:44.221 --> 00:51:45.054
<v Speaker 2>I mean here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on right now with the </v>

1307
00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Dakota access pipeline where everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>blaming trump for this.</v>

1308
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.413
<v Speaker 2>They forget this all started while Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in office all over this where they </v>

1309
00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 2>were putting easements on people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>private land.</v>

1310
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 2>When they were arresting these ranchers </v>
<v Speaker 2>for protesting against it,</v>

1311
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep these guys from drilling </v>
<v Speaker 2>into their fucking private land.</v>

1312
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.730
<v Speaker 2>That was all during the Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

1313
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 2>All of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1314
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 2>but he gets walking out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am going to cancel that.</v>

1315
00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:09.663
<v Speaker 2>He stopped it and knowing that trump was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kickstarter right back up and </v>

1316
00:52:12.481 --> 00:52:13.314
<v Speaker 2>he would take the blame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all crazy with the Chelsea manning </v>

1317
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.920
<v Speaker 2>commutation and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about Chelsea manning right after he</v>

1318
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:22.343
<v Speaker 2>says that he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A weak leader says Obama's weekly to </v>

1319
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 2>pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just let you out of jail.</v>

1320
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Be in jail forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be in jail for ever.</v>

1321
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 2>You could die in jail or in May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to go to a ballgame.</v>

1322
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1323
00:52:34.311 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's gonna want to go,</v>

1324
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 2>so she right the Bradley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Chelsea.</v>

1325
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.340
<v Speaker 2>She who was formerly known as Brad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.211
<v Speaker 2>Brad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1327
00:52:44.211 --> 00:52:46.780
<v Speaker 2>they're not gonna pay for her medication</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1328
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Now that she's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a drawback.</v>

1329
00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:51.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess she will figure it out.</v>

1330
00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I think just do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chelsea Manning,</v>

1331
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 2>our Chelsea manning experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1332
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.643
<v Speaker 2>Good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1333
00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.010
<v Speaker 2>The death squad network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1334
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Why not make some money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He or she has got to figure out a way to</v>

1335
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:07.063
<v Speaker 2>exactly earn a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she'll be on Fox News on the view </v>

<v Speaker 2>Foxtail is going to bring her in as a </v>

1337
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:15.030
<v Speaker 2>contributor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can run on red.</v>

1338
00:53:15.031 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1339
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.463
<v Speaker 2>Come on on side kick show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of psychological damage is </v>

1340
00:53:23.151 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 2>being in solitary confinement naked for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three years.</v>

1341
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad is that?</v>

1342
00:53:28.201 --> 00:53:29.034
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because she was in solitary confinement </v>

1343
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and they wouldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>give her any clothes.</v>

1344
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I am her,</v>

<v Speaker 2>him and her.</v>

1346
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I think originally formerly known as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brad,</v>

1347
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I think probably had some clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably had some,</v>

1348
00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so non suicide watch close.</v>

1349
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the whole deal is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept her naked ladies are saying it</v>

1350
00:53:48.841 --> 00:53:52.080
<v Speaker 2>was tantamount to torture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying.</v>

1353
00:53:55.021 --> 00:53:55.854
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking it may not quite that way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>although there may be some mental issues</v>

1367
00:54:20.161 --> 00:54:23.880
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying maybe that he or she was</v>

1368
00:54:23.881 --> 00:54:28.800
<v Speaker 2>not up to snuff or feeling a leveled </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1369

<v Speaker 2>coast,</v>

<v Speaker 2>manage description of how he was placed </v>
<v Speaker 2>on suicide watch for three days from the</v>

1372
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 2>18th of January.</v>

1373
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I was stripped of all clothing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exception of my underwear.</v>

1374
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.833
<v Speaker 2>My prescription eyeglasses were taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from me and I was forced to sit in </v>

1375
00:54:45.051 --> 00:54:46.630
<v Speaker 2>a central blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1377
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like if someone took my contacts </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from me,</v>

1378
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happy when you're in darkness.</v>

1379
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't need your glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1380
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not in darkness either.</v>

1381
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 2>He said it was in total blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1382
00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.520
<v Speaker 2>essentially blind from not having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription glasses.</v>

1383
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1384
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 2>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was three days,</v>

1385
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:05.580
<v Speaker 2>but you see how this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now suddenly he spends three years naked</v>

1386
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 2>and in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the truth is,</v>

1387
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.790
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this from a right wing,</v>

1388
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:12.330
<v Speaker 2>from the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1389
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:13.163
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth tends to always be </v>

1390
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:20.160
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in some defined middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parameter of shift on the middle,</v>

1391
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:21.203
<v Speaker 2>but it also describes the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being stripped naked at night and made </v>

1392
00:55:24.031 --> 00:55:27.000
<v Speaker 2>to stand for parade in the nude parade.</v>

1393
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.193
<v Speaker 2>Is there a parade for race horses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A condition that continues to this day </v>

1394
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.863
<v Speaker 2>in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guard told me to stand at parade </v>

1395
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 2>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

1396
00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Parade rest for about three minutes with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hands behind my back and my leg.</v>

1397
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder width apart.</v>

1398
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I stood at parade rest for about three </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1399
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.560
<v Speaker 2>The brig supervisor and the other guards</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk past my cell,</v>

1400
00:55:49.561 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 2>looked at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paused for a moment,</v>

1401
00:55:51.061 --> 00:55:51.894
<v Speaker 2>and then continue to the next cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was incredibly embarrassed at having </v>

1402
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.540
<v Speaker 2>all these people stare at me naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm embarrassed.</v>

1403
00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Embarrassed is torture.</v>

1404
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:00.443
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand that because you </v>

1405
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:04.890
<v Speaker 2>can look at me naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just tell you right now.</v>

1406
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.530
<v Speaker 2>You want to stare at me and they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet without any clothes on if you don't</v>

1407
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:08.640
<v Speaker 2>beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1408
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 2>If you're not getting me or torturing me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're staring at me naked.</v>

1409
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my Dick.</v>

1410
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:13.580
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1411
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.280
<v Speaker 2>There's my butthole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to look?</v>

1412
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.240
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of Weirdo or you don't.</v>

1413
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.450
<v Speaker 2>You have one too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>

1414
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.170
<v Speaker 2>You want me to look at yours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to look at yours.</v>

1415
00:56:22.171 --> 00:56:23.480
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm less weird than you.</v>

1416
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.960
<v Speaker 2>You know all that talk and would go very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in the military brigade.</v>

1417
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd probably beat me to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1419
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:30.363
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1420
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:34.280
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know her,</v>

1421
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:38.380
<v Speaker 2>her sentences commuted and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can now move on.</v>

1422
00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.090
<v Speaker 2>She starts her podcasts and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question is yeah,</v>

1423
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.720
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of people that thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going to.</v>

1424
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beau Bergdahl,</v>

1425
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Sergeant Bergdahl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fellow who walked into the Taliban camp,</v>

1426
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 2>turned himself in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked off his post.</v>

1427
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1428
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1429
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:54.803
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did they think they're going to </v>

1430
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 2>wear?</v>

1431
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought that Obama was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do that as well.</v>

1432
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:58.720
<v Speaker 2>President Obama was going to do that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1433
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought maybe snowden.</v>

1434
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I thought snowden would have been a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting one,</v>

1435
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:05.224
<v Speaker 2>but apparently what he said to meet a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of sense was the difference between </v>

1436
00:57:06.821 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 2>when Chelsea Manning did was Chelsea </v>
<v Speaker 2>manning was arrested,</v>

1437
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 2>went through trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was convicted,</v>

1438
00:57:11.201 --> 00:57:14.610
<v Speaker 2>and then he pardoned her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Commuted her sentence that,</v>

1439
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.783
<v Speaker 2>that snowden never face trial and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he fled and because he went to </v>

1440
00:57:20.591 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1441
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.860
<v Speaker 2>essentially our enemy to Russia to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1442
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

1443
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1444
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.220
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't leave when you,</v>

1445
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.533
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that somehow he kept all the </v>

1446
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 2>materials safe from the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just it just cracks the Chinese.</v>

1447
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 2>He spent time in Hong Kong and I carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>you step foot in,</v>

1448
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.760
<v Speaker 2>in Hong Kong or it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1449
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:41.350
<v Speaker 2>your cell phone with a one.</v>

1450
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:43.880
<v Speaker 2>You've gotten this idea that somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1451
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Glenn Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is an interesting cat.</v>

1452
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he's not,</v>

1453
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:47.314
<v Speaker 2>but Glenn Greenwald and somehow snowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to beat the Chinese </v>

1454
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:53.740
<v Speaker 2>intelligence service and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the FSB is a,</v>

1455
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.120
<v Speaker 2>might be a bridge too far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1456
00:57:56.121 --> 00:57:56.954
<v Speaker 2>so you'd have to have some pretty deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation to be able to </v>

1457
00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:00.641
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1458
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to really understand how </v>
<v Speaker 2>those networks work and maybe snowden be</v>

1459
00:58:03.701 --> 00:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>able to protect certain aspects of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about.</v>

1460
00:58:06.461 --> 00:58:08.150
<v Speaker 2>But I think we have to remember the </v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

1461
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:09.003
<v Speaker 2>he was not lex luther.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's sort of the narrative got </v>

1462
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:14.860
<v Speaker 2>built up that he was a mastermind at NSA</v>
<v Speaker 2>and high school dropout.</v>

1463
00:58:14.861 --> 00:58:19.850
<v Speaker 2>He was an Admin guy and it was an it </v>
<v Speaker 2>admin guy who identified a weakness.</v>

1464
00:58:19.851 --> 00:58:20.261
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair,</v>

1465
00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:22.390
<v Speaker 2>go to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He figured out a weakness in the systems</v>

1466
00:58:22.391 --> 00:58:24.100
<v Speaker 2>and you know how to manipulate that.</v>

1467
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Not that someone can't be a high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropout and be bright.</v>

1468
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was a high school dropout,</v>

1469
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got his ged.</v>

1470
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was obviously a fucking genius.</v>

1471
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:38.761
<v Speaker 2>He's a super smart kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know the whole thing.</v>

1472
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very strange.</v>

1473
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:42.960
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1474
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.140
<v Speaker 2>on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1475
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:44.974
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants their God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emails peered into constantly when they </v>

1476
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 2>haven't done a damn thing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of a free country.</v>

1477
00:58:50.261 --> 00:58:50.891
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1478
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a freak.</v>

1479
00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm a free man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1480
00:58:53.471 --> 00:58:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I have a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1481
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.843
<v Speaker 2>I pay my taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't start any trouble why they </v>

1482
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:59.650
<v Speaker 2>looked at in my email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>

1483
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.293
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people felt like they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>vindicated in their fears by this guy </v>

1484
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 2>coming out and what snowden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

1485
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how did you see it?</v>

1486
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this.</v>

1487
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I saw it in more of a simplistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>operational perspective because again,</v>

1488
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:16.243
<v Speaker 2>what we talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody looks at these things from </v>

1489
00:59:17.711 --> 00:59:18.544
<v Speaker 2>their own life experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My life experiences are different than </v>

1490
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>somebody who hasn't done it,</v>

1491
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.550
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sign up,</v>

1492
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:27.560
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sign,</v>

1493
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.920
<v Speaker 4>you commit yourself to protect national </v>
<v Speaker 4>security.</v>

1494
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 4>You commit yourself to treat a </v>
<v Speaker 4>classified material honorably.</v>

1495
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.930
<v Speaker 4>So just like the secret service agent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1496
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.770
<v Speaker 4>when you start making posts on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook,</v>

1497
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:40.604
<v Speaker 4>this is against the whole gig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're breaching your agreements and </v>

1498
00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1499
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 4>but people will hear that and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1500
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 4>but he was doing a service or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they have the,</v>

1501
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:48.790
<v Speaker 4>they do have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this bullshit out there about how he,</v>

1502
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 4>he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tried several times to go and,</v>

1503
00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and talk about this now.</v>

1504
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.480
<v Speaker 4>They never brought it to the New York </v>
<v Speaker 4>Times or Washington Post or any of those</v>

1505
00:59:56.481 --> 00:59:56.991
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1506
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 4>internally it was like he's got the </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative that says,</v>

1507
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:00.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to my soup,</v>

1508
01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 4>I tried to get this out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1509
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.513
<v Speaker 4>And once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth is not exactly in either </v>

1510
01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 4>sides.</v>

1511
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.591
<v Speaker 4>Narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1512
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:07.424
<v Speaker 4>I'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1513
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.600
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1514
01:00:08.601 --> 01:00:10.010
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the far right that goes after him.</v>

1515
01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 4>It says he should be hanged for treason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bullshit.</v>

1516
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shouldn't,</v>

1517
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.310
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I do believe he should</v>
<v Speaker 4>face,</v>

1518
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1519
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.480
<v Speaker 4>the court system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1520
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:20.370
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't,</v>

1521
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are gonna disagree with that.</v>

1522
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:22.611
<v Speaker 4>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

1523
01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:23.444
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1524
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea of,</v>

1525
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:25.724
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the people went histrionics and </v>

1526
01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:27.261
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1527
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 4>you should be hung.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

1528
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:29.504
<v Speaker 4>That's not how we operate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also get the idea that people felt </v>

1529
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:33.670
<v Speaker 4>like that was good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1530
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:34.523
<v Speaker 4>ultimately that we had that conversation</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I agree with that point because we </v>

1531
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:40.820
<v Speaker 4>should always have those conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a way to do it as a place to</v>

1532
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 4>do that as a manner of doing that.</v>

1533
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.053
<v Speaker 4>But would we have had that conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>without him because I don't think we </v>

1534
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:46.574
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1535
01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't disagree necessarily disagree </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that,</v>

1536
01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:51.370
<v Speaker 4>but I think that the point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a.</v>

1537
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:52.520
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

1538
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.353
<v Speaker 4>Where we got what failed us was up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Capitol Hill where they fail to do what </v>

1539
01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:58.391
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're,</v>

1540
01:00:58.391 --> 01:00:59.224
<v Speaker 4>as politicians that we've got there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are protocols in place and a </v>

1541
01:01:04.701 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 4>curious public or a curious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1542
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:07.993
<v Speaker 4>people's representatives are always </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be having these discussions </v>

1543
01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:12.284
<v Speaker 4>about where on the spectrum between </v>
<v Speaker 4>security and civil liberties and </v>

1544
01:01:15.711 --> 01:01:16.420
<v Speaker 4>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1545
01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 4>where does that pendulum rest at any </v>
<v Speaker 4>given time?</v>

1546
01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people up on the hill in the Intel</v>

1547
01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 4>committees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1548
01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 4>this is a well worn path from NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the CIA,</v>

1549
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:33.140
<v Speaker 4>from others up to that hill to brief </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people on every fucking thing that</v>

1550
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:33.770
<v Speaker 4>goes on.</v>

1551
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1552
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.020
<v Speaker 4>this just then people are going to roll </v>
<v Speaker 4>her eyes,</v>

1553
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:36.854
<v Speaker 4>but that's the way it fucking works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then this is also this game it </v>

1554
01:01:40.551 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 4>gets played in Washington where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend like they don't know,</v>

1555
01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 4>and then they get outraged and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up and say,</v>

1556
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:45.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1557
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.110
<v Speaker 4>there's almost an angst ridden a horse </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1558
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Those people didn't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't pursue,</v>

1559
01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:50.984
<v Speaker 4>they didn't ask the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't demand that we have these </v>

1560
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 4>discussions internally to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think,</v>

1561
01:01:58.941 --> 01:02:01.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians in part dropped the ball.</v>

1562
01:02:01.011 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 4>They don't do what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The healthiest thing.</v>

1563
01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:03.674
<v Speaker 4>We could have a course or people up on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hill who are constantly questioning </v>

1564
01:02:09.171 --> 01:02:10.004
<v Speaker 4>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly talking about it because </v>

1565
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:12.740
<v Speaker 4>you're right and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very important.</v>

1566
01:02:12.741 --> 01:02:13.574
<v Speaker 4>You have to figure out where that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now another bomb goes off somewhere and </v>

1567
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 4>that pendulum's going to swing back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>security.</v>

1568
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:18.531
<v Speaker 4>People go say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

1569
01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1570
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check my shoes,</v>

1571
01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 4>do whatever the hell you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1572
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 4>read my emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just keep us safe.</v>

1573
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.270
<v Speaker 4>And in particular it's a big incident </v>
<v Speaker 4>and God forbid,</v>

1574
01:02:27.271 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 4>but that's where I guess my point being </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that pendulum is constantly moving.</v>

1575
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that frustrated to frustrate you?</v>

1576
01:02:32.861 --> 01:02:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Because that's where the conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>theorists come in.</v>

1577
01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Whenever something goes on and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of a terrorist attack,</v>

1578
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.333
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theorist jump in and say this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a false flag because they'd been </v>

1579
01:02:41.951 --> 01:02:42.784
<v Speaker 3>trying to erode our privacy and erode </v>
<v Speaker 3>our civil liberties and this is the way </v>

1580
01:02:46.331 --> 01:02:47.164
<v Speaker 3>they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of looking at it in a broad </v>

1581
01:02:49.841 --> 01:02:51.370
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like looking at it saying,</v>

1582
01:02:51.371 --> 01:02:51.820
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1583
01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:56.590
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that a terrorist act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a terrorist act took place,</v>

1584
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:59.710
<v Speaker 3>and now they have to tighten up security</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that?</v>

1585
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:00.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1586
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.270
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1587
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.270
<v Speaker 3>People are Matt automatically go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1588
01:03:04.271 --> 01:03:05.104
<v Speaker 3>They orchestrated the terrorist attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that they could tighten up security </v>

1589
01:03:07.901 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 3>because it's this overall global plan to</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn this off.</v>

1590
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 4>One world government government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1591
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.061
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1592
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I hope I get to be in charge of that one</v>
<v Speaker 4>world government.</v>

1593
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.293
<v Speaker 4>That's all I could say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would make a hell of a one world </v>

1594
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:22.080
<v Speaker 4>government leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how would you,</v>

1595
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:24.350
<v Speaker 4>how would you do things differently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1596
01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.201
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kidding.</v>

1597
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.520
<v Speaker 4>I would hate to be in charge of one </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1598
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:28.160
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine what a goat rope that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be.</v>

1599
01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't even want to be a mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Being a mayor of the town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a town of 10,000</v>

1601
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.690
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna have 4,000</v>

1602
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.520
<v Speaker 3>to fucking hate you.</v>

1603
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Retail politics.</v>

1604
01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:41.660
<v Speaker 4>I think of the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1605
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:45.800
<v Speaker 4>local politics and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>

1606
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about Idaho again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And was like,</v>

1607
01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:48.194
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for fuck's sake.</v>

1608
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.093
<v Speaker 4>But in Idaho as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can walk down a street in Boise and </v>

1609
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 4>bumped into the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lieutenant Governor,</v>

1610
01:03:52.971 --> 01:03:54.320
<v Speaker 4>we have a nice chat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're great guys,</v>

1611
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.050
<v Speaker 4>great people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ranchers,</v>

1612
01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:57.080
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do this.</v>

1613
01:03:57.190 --> 01:04:00.230
<v Speaker 4>And in Idaho they do a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a point to that story.</v>

1614
01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.020
<v Speaker 4>I'll get it to a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they have the legislature,</v>

1615
01:04:03.021 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 4>just an office for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1616
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:06.950
<v Speaker 4>they do all the work they need to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

1617
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.510
<v Speaker 4>They get back to that damn jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1618
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Insurance broker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>car guy,</v>

1619
01:04:09.921 --> 01:04:11.660
<v Speaker 4>a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rancher,</v>

1620
01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:15.200
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's Kinda the way it should be,</v>

1621
01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.093
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need people governing you 12 </v>

1622
01:04:18.591 --> 01:04:21.290
<v Speaker 4>months of the fucking year doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not necessary.</v>

1623
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1624
01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:24.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the piracy,</v>

1625
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I forgot the point of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>

1626
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.530
<v Speaker 4>you've got this environment where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can watch the local politics.</v>

1627
01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:33.350
<v Speaker 4>That's the point of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can see the congress because I'm</v>

1628
01:04:33.351 --> 01:04:35.010
<v Speaker 4>on the flights with them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the senator,</v>

1629
01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Senator Rich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great guy,</v>

1630
01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:37.970
<v Speaker 4>he's on the Intel Committee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant guy.</v>

1631
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.810
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1632
01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:43.810
<v Speaker 4>you see what they have to do to stay in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in office,</v>

1633
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it,</v>

1634
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.493
<v Speaker 4>particularly the congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're always campaigning there always </v>

1635
01:04:48.171 --> 01:04:51.170
<v Speaker 4>raising funds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always politicking it just.</v>

1636
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.380
<v Speaker 4>And you think that it's pretty fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

1637
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:55.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's why I'm,</v>

1638
01:04:55.701 --> 01:04:59.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of term limits and a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>fan of saying,</v>

1639
01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:01.220
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this does nothing set in stone that says</v>

1640
01:05:01.221 --> 01:05:04.730
<v Speaker 4>our congressman congresswoman have to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>just two year terms.</v>

1641
01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.623
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did that in the old days because </v>

1642
01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:07.244
<v Speaker 4>nobody wanted to be in dc because it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a swamp and they had to get back to </v>

1643
01:05:09.231 --> 01:05:11.060
<v Speaker 4>their farms and actually earn a living.</v>

1644
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:12.523
<v Speaker 4>So stretch that out to four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can be a congressman for a total </v>

1645
01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:16.160
<v Speaker 4>of eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get two terms.</v>

1646
01:05:16.161 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 4>You could be a senator for terms six </v>
<v Speaker 4>years each and then get the hell out.</v>

1647
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 4>Go back to your jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do something else.</v>

1648
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:22.923
<v Speaker 4>And I think we would do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would deepen the pool of potential </v>

1649
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 4>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would see other people come up,</v>

1650
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:28.803
<v Speaker 4>rise up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would take some of the money out of </v>

1651
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe take a little bit of the influence</v>

1652
01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.610
<v Speaker 4>on some of the influence out of it yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>if I know somebody going to be in office</v>

1653
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:37.683
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the ways and means committee for 36 </v>

1654
01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:40.744
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to invest a lot of effort and </v>

1655
01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:46.180
<v Speaker 4>time and that individual if I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lobbying firm and on k street in DC,</v>

1656
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I don't,</v>

1657
01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 4>if that person's not going to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to share.</v>

1658
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll figure out how to work the system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1659
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.330
<v Speaker 4>But I'm gonna it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Kinda at least shake it up a little</v>

1660
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.550
<v Speaker 4>bit and I think it would take some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that money and influence out.</v>

1661
01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.931
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1662
01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:00.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where I was going with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

1663
01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:01.170
<v Speaker 4>That was pretty boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1664
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were just comparing another million.</v>

1665
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.023
<v Speaker 4>The difference between local politics </v>
<v Speaker 4>where people have an actual job on top </v>

1666
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 4>of being a local politician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:10.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1668
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:11.500
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a dirty business.</v>

1669
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.480
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you're in the business of </v>
<v Speaker 4>governing people,</v>

1670
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 4>you're in the business of controlling </v>
<v Speaker 4>people here in the business of trying to</v>

1671
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:17.734
<v Speaker 4>pass laws that help the people that put </v>
<v Speaker 4>you in power in the first place and it </v>

1672
01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:24.580
<v Speaker 4>just gets you real squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little dodgy.</v>

1673
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.190
<v Speaker 4>How about that dose ea on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on President trump,</v>

1674
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 4>but what I would say that came out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was supposedly,</v>

1675
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.580
<v Speaker 4>you know who did it that buzzfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the Buzzfeed,</v>

1676
01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Speaker 4>I think they were the ones who printed </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1677
01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:36.790
<v Speaker 4>Just recent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a recent one that,</v>

1678
01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:37.624
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russian was supposedly that he was </v>

1679
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:42.830
<v Speaker 4>gauged and shenanigans with that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pen on the bed stuff that's,</v>

1680
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was ridiculous about that.</v>

1681
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Was that major news sources reporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as an unsubstantiated rumor.</v>

1682
01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't do that.</v>

1683
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

1684
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:53.441
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1685
01:06:53.441 --> 01:06:54.274
<v Speaker 4>that had been out and circulating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then how could they possibly entertain </v>

1686
01:06:58.451 --> 01:06:59.284
<v Speaker 4>that when they know when the times and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can pick up the New York Times on </v>

1687
01:07:01.841 --> 01:07:05.530
<v Speaker 4>any given day and they've got a front </v>
<v Speaker 4>page above the fold story that's relying</v>

1688
01:07:05.531 --> 01:07:08.050
<v Speaker 4>almost exclusively on anonymous sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just insane.</v>

1689
01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:09.160
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1690
01:07:09.161 --> 01:07:10.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

1691
01:07:10.751 --> 01:07:11.584
<v Speaker 4>it was amazing that they would run with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and it was a complete bullshit </v>

1692
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.920
<v Speaker 4>report.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a hatchet job hatch.</v>

1693
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:16.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1694
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:17.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like a hack wrote it.</v>

1695
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lose Good and Hookers to pee on him.</v>

1696
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well come on.</v>

1697
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:22.744
<v Speaker 4>It's supposedly the narrative became </v>
<v Speaker 4>then for those that would like to have </v>

1698
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:25.114
<v Speaker 4>believed that it became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the person that wrote it as a very </v>

1699
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.013
<v Speaker 4>distinguished former mys six officer </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a British secret service and they </v>

1700
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:34.090
<v Speaker 4>had no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not currently.</v>

1701
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just.</v>

1702
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.410
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1703
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:39.610
<v Speaker 4>The world of the world of political </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposition research,</v>

1704
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:40.444
<v Speaker 4>this shouldn't surprise anybody is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's populated by a lot of sketchy </v>

1705
01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:43.550
<v Speaker 4>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1706
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.010
<v Speaker 4>and no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1707
01:07:45.011 --> 01:07:48.760
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know somebody should do a series about</v>

1708
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:49.700
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1709
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.330
<v Speaker 4>but real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real,</v>

1710
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>

1711
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a,</v>

1712
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.570
<v Speaker 4>that was a fascinating little glitch in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the old,</v>

1713
01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the radar.</v>

1714
01:07:56.681 --> 01:08:01.681
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just seemed so strange and,</v>

1715
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.093
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the strangest parts was his </v>

1716
01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 4>response to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows I'm a Germaphobe.</v>

1717
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like what's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like I tell all my people,</v>

1718
01:08:11.081 --> 01:08:12.820
<v Speaker 4>when you go to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're filming anything,</v>

1719
01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:15.100
<v Speaker 4>don't do anything stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't screw around,</v>

1720
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.943
<v Speaker 4>don't get paid on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you really think I would just have </v>

1721
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:18.660
<v Speaker 4>people peeing on me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1722
01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's got a point there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1723
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 4>it is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with it from as a tidy person.</v>

1724
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:25.124
<v Speaker 4>I'm a beating on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife would say I'm a very tidy </v>

1725
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1726
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my first thought would be,</v>

1727
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:28.994
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is going to change these </v>

1728
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:30.374
<v Speaker 4>sheets and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we've got a carpet and what the </v>

1729
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 4>hell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:36.740
<v Speaker 4>It depends on how much they've had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink obviously.</v>

1731
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.253
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what if they've eaten </v>

<v Speaker 4>who's into the WHO's into that?</v>

1733
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.540
<v Speaker 4>That's what I really want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:43.483
<v Speaker 4>And what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it's usually I've talked to girls </v>

1735
01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 4>who are dominatrixes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they tell you,</v>

1736
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 4>it's always these guys that are like big</v>
<v Speaker 4>time ceos.</v>

1737
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 4>They run corporations with power type </v>
<v Speaker 4>A's.</v>

1738
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:56.204
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they want to take them up and shit </v>

1739
01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:00.530
<v Speaker 4>on their head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

1740
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:01.364
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you describe it that way I can see </v>

1741
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 4>what the attraction is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1742
01:09:03.891 --> 01:09:06.610
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1743
01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.370
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1744
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:09.300
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was again,</v>

1745
01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 4>because that got out there completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>unsubstantiated.</v>

1746
01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.870
<v Speaker 4>But it became that narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1747
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.320
<v Speaker 4>And people would start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1748
01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me tell you about it.</v>

1749
01:09:17.261 --> 01:09:18.094
<v Speaker 4>I overheard a conversation today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully these people that I overheard </v>

1750
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:22.220
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope they are listening.</v>

1751
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:27.730
<v Speaker 4>I was at the hotel I'm staying at while </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in town and I was staying at the bar</v>

1752
01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 4>and a cup of coffee to go this early </v>
<v Speaker 4>this morning.</v>

1753
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.823
<v Speaker 4>And there were two fellows sitting at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of chairs and they were talking </v>

1754
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.504
<v Speaker 4>about the new administration and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could tell they were seriously angst </v>

1755

<v Speaker 4>written about the whole thing.</v>

1756
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 4>They were hyperventilate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very upset about it.</v>

1757
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them said,</v>

1758
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:45.500
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tell you what I'm worried about.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm worried about this whole Muslim ban </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1760
01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:48.520
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1762
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.340

<v Speaker 4>supremacist nation,</v>

1763
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.880
<v Speaker 4>my budget,</v>

<v Speaker 4>just said.</v>

1766
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what I'm worried about.</v>

1767

<v Speaker 4>agreement with Russia and in next thing </v>

1769
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 4>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just one country,</v>

1770
01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:10.220
<v Speaker 4>the Middle East to get their hands on </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that oil.</v>

1771
01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.910
<v Speaker 4>And the other guy says in response to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that says that's already happening.</v>

1772
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:16.760

<v Speaker 4>And I'm of these guys.</v>

1774
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to tell them they were in</v>

1775
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:20.150
<v Speaker 4>a hotel lobby.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they weren't,</v>

1777
01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.880
<v Speaker 4>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you don't know who these guys were.</v>

1778
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:24.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were dressed what?</v>

1779
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:25.783
<v Speaker 4>Distinguished,</v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguished yell mid thirties </v>

1780
01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:28.050
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1781
01:10:28.051 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 4>and they really believed what they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

1782
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:30.141
<v Speaker 4>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1783
01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:30.974
<v Speaker 4>they were reinforcing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying it doesn't happen on </v>

1784
01:10:32.421 --> 01:10:33.260
<v Speaker 4>the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course it happens.</v>

1785
01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:34.380
<v Speaker 4>On the other side too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1786
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:39.440
<v Speaker 4>but that's the point is it's we've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>people fucking going crazy.</v>

1787
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:41.160
<v Speaker 4>They're losing their minds and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>just now with,</v>

1788
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.013
<v Speaker 4>with president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously the people on the right that </v>

1789
01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:44.390
<v Speaker 4>we're doing the same thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>previous,</v>

1790
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.313
<v Speaker 4>a previous president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know I wanted to turn </v>

1791
01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:49.100
<v Speaker 4>around and say something to them and at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least just say,</v>

1792
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:50.023
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like do you think you've maybe over </v>

1793
01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:52.790
<v Speaker 4>there I was having dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that I.</v>

1794
01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 4>not that I sit in and eavesdrop on </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1795
01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.570
<v Speaker 4>This is your move this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my thing.</v>

1796
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.730
<v Speaker 4>Intelligence Agency collects data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go,</v>

1797
01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tends to be,</v>

1798
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:06.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm at dinner in New York last week and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a table next to me and I would</v>

1799
01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:07.434
<v Speaker 4>just sit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was waiting for my colleagues to show </v>

1800
01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:08.871
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was,</v>

1801
01:11:08.871 --> 01:11:09.704
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was listening to the conversation </v>

1802
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 4>and they were again sort of feeding each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other about,</v>

1803
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:17.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apocalyptic results from the election.</v>

1804
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.590
<v Speaker 4>And one of them said this is the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1805
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:20.424
<v Speaker 4>And he was absolutely serious and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys were probably in their early </v>

1806
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 4>sixties and dress very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could tell they were,</v>

1807
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:25.463
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and their wives are with them and then </v>

1808
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:31.260
<v Speaker 4>socializing one percent group and one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them says this is the worst thing that's</v>

1809
01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:32.370
<v Speaker 4>ever happened to this country.</v>

1810
01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.120
<v Speaker 4>And that actually did make me then </v>
<v Speaker 4>interrupt,</v>

1811
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.070
<v Speaker 4>which is ruined admittedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I said,</v>

1812
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.510
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you don't mind me.</v>

1813
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I overheard what you said.</v>

1814
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:42.443
<v Speaker 4>Does that include nine slash 11?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it include Pearl Harbor doesn't </v>

1815
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 4>include the assassination of Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an include the great depression,</v>

1816
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.033
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1817
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.620
<v Speaker 4>how do you define worst thing to ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to our country?</v>

1818
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.770
<v Speaker 4>And I know the guy looked at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1819
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 4>I was a Douche bag and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1820
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.033
<v Speaker 4>at least it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least you recognized what he was </v>

1821
01:12:01.741 --> 01:12:03.260
<v Speaker 4>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I said I,</v>

1822
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:03.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1823
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.610
<v Speaker 4>I'll go back to my drink and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1824
01:12:05.611 --> 01:12:07.320
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would just curious.</v>

1825
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:10.140
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no give and take.</v>

1826
01:12:10.141 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 4>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1827
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.380
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get some magical </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>

1828
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess I was big over the top a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

1829
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:14.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1830
01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:15.300
<v Speaker 4>that didn't happen.</v>

1831
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.133
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just went back to them so I don't </v>

1832
01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:18.511
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1833
01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:20.040
<v Speaker 4>we should all just chill the fuck out a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

1834
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.903
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people get on their team and they stick </v>

1835
01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's team left or team right in,</v>

1836
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:31.401
<v Speaker 4>which is why all those people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti war refused to go crazy about Obama</v>

1837
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:33.090
<v Speaker 4>and the drones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1838
01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:36.660
<v Speaker 4>You look at all the drone deaths that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened during the Obama administration</v>

1839
01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 4>and what percentage of them were </v>
<v Speaker 4>innocent civilians.</v>

1840
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:39.444
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty staggering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't hear about that from the </v>

1841
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:41.814
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you hear about it from the left is </v>

1842
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.823
<v Speaker 4>that the right is a bunch of warmongers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing terrible things and they </v>

1843
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:49.290
<v Speaker 4>look terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things are done right there.</v>

1844
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Just that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how the world operates.</v>

1845
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice if we didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible things.</v>

1846
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be.</v>

1847
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:56.203
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice if there weren't places</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world that were horrific right </v>

1848
01:12:59.040 --> 01:12:59.290
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1849
01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:00.500
<v Speaker 4>All I could think of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with that,</v>

1850
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:02.230
<v Speaker 4>what would I do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's my.</v>

1851
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 4>What's my revenue stream at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I complain about,</v>

1852
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.353
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about what's going on </v>

1853
01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:09.240
<v Speaker 4>right now in Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1854
01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:10.543
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty significant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's no explain to people what's </v>

1855
01:13:12.101 --> 01:13:13.230
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1856
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean at the 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot level of sort of,</v>

1857
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.570
<v Speaker 4>not to have to start from a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>

1858
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:20.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's a 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot level.</v>

1859
01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.800
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1860
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.673
<v Speaker 4>we've lost a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a significant amount of leverage in the </v>

1861
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as an example,</v>

1862
01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:29.034
<v Speaker 4>when previous secretary Kerry from </v>
<v Speaker 4>President Obama's administration talked </v>

1863
01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:34.010
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1864
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 4>going to a conference to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>peace in Syria.</v>

1865
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 4>It's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

1866
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 4>We don't have any influence in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were not the player out there</v>

1867
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.441
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

1868
01:13:43.441 --> 01:13:44.274
<v Speaker 4>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea that we're going to step off </v>

1869
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 4>the world stage a little bit as we did </v>
<v Speaker 4>that over the past several years,</v>

1870
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.863
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iran in particular has realized more </v>

1871
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.453
<v Speaker 4>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more leverage in that region than </v>

1872
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 4>they've had in modern times.</v>

1873
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.590
<v Speaker 4>And they're ecstatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

1874
01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:00.690
<v Speaker 4>they can't believe their good fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1875
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:01.763
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just beating on that whole </v>

1876
01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.710
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous a nuclear agreement that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>ended up signing,</v>

1877
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:09.623
<v Speaker 4>which if secretary Kerry was telling the</v>
<v Speaker 4>truth and saying that it was all based </v>

1878
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 4>on verification,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're kind of fucked because I'm here to</v>

1879
01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:17.950
<v Speaker 4>tell you we don't have really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>verification on their programs.</v>

1880
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 4>We and we haven't had it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1881
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.823
<v Speaker 4>so we rely on the Israelis to a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal on some of our couple of our other </v>

1882
01:14:24.221 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 4>allies out there who have better human </v>
<v Speaker 4>source intelligence.</v>

1883
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.290
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it was down to us,</v>

1884
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.393
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd be flying a little bit blind </v>

1885
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:32.590
<v Speaker 4>because it's up to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough,</v>

1886
01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:33.640
<v Speaker 4>tough target.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1887
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.930
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1888
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:36.843
<v Speaker 4>point being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the Iranians saw an opening over the </v>

1889
01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:41.230
<v Speaker 4>past few years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1890
01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 4>to do what they wanted to do for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and now they have,</v>

1891
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:47.083
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a increasingly tight relationship with </v>

1892
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Iraq of all places.</v>

1893
01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:55.310
<v Speaker 4>The Russians saw the same thing that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iranian saw in the Middle East and,</v>

1894
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:55.770
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1895
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:56.603
<v Speaker 4>and we'll get to Israel in second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Israel is just kind of sitting </v>

1896
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.151
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1897
01:14:58.151 --> 01:14:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Like Fort Apache.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Bronx,</v>

1898
01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.150
<v Speaker 4>so Israel is sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1899
01:15:01.151 --> 01:15:01.984
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are questioning whether we've got </v>

1900
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.220
<v Speaker 4>the same sort of commitment to them over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the past few years.</v>

1901
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Russia sees the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Iranian see,</v>

1902
01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:10.270
<v Speaker 4>so Russia goes in and they start doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1903
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start,</v>

1904
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:12.340
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've signed weapons agreements,</v>

1905
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.710
<v Speaker 4>arms agreements with a rock of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>places,</v>

1906
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.573
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq rock.</v>

1907
01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.680
<v Speaker 4>They're selling hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1908
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:21.270
<v Speaker 4>to the Iraqis after everything we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and all the blood and,</v>

1909
01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.193
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1910
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.510
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1911
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.070
<v Speaker 4>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've done the same thing with,</v>

1912
01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.020
<v Speaker 4>with Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've signed weapons agreements,</v>

1913
01:15:28.021 --> 01:15:29.530
<v Speaker 4>significant weapons agreements with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt.</v>

1914
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 4>They haven't had a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt since the,</v>

1915
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 4>since the Nassar days going all the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1916
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:38.280
<v Speaker 4>And increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1917
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:39.820
<v Speaker 4>obviously the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1918
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:41.160
<v Speaker 4>they were never ever going to give up </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1919
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.840
<v Speaker 4>on what they had in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got a,</v>

1920
01:15:42.841 --> 01:15:45.010
<v Speaker 4>they've got one port for their Black Sea</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fleet.</v>

1921
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:46.750
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's in Syria.</v>

1922
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:49.810
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were going to work together.</v>

1923
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.610
<v Speaker 4>This is one of those fallacies again </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you think,</v>

1924
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.430
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

1925
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:53.263
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our interests are aligned as far as </v>

1926
01:15:54.221 --> 01:15:55.090
<v Speaker 4>fighting isis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1927
01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking not that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are not at all.</v>

1928
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:01.240
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that somehow we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to,</v>

1929
01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.393
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

1930
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:03.423
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that Russia had the same sort of </v>

1931
01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:08.320
<v Speaker 4>agenda of Russia was never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never gonna let Assad go unless they had</v>

1932
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:11.620
<v Speaker 4>a rock solid replacement who was on </v>
<v Speaker 4>their team.</v>

1933
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:17.130
<v Speaker 4>So they've created this alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Turkey in the meantime is kind of slid</v>

1934
01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 4>in there as well with that st packed </v>
<v Speaker 4>again because we kind of stepped off the</v>

1935
01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 4>stage and people were curious and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are not curious,</v>

1936
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 4>but people confused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does America stand,</v>

1937
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 4>where are we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are our commitments?</v>

1938
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.910
<v Speaker 4>And when we don't say it out loud where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't prove it,</v>

1939
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.013
<v Speaker 4>then they start looking elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Germany and Turkey start creating an </v>

1940
01:16:34.931 --> 01:16:35.930
<v Speaker 4>alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1941
01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UK and China,</v>

1942
01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>create economic alliances.</v>

1943
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:40.751
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1944
01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 4>France and Russia working together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>again in counter terrorism,</v>

1945
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.333
<v Speaker 4>you start getting these weird alliances </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been built up over now the </v>

1946
01:16:47.231 --> 01:16:48.064
<v Speaker 4>past recent few years and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>surprised that somehow the European </v>

1947
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Union is kind of coming apart a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit at the fabric.</v>

1948
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so anyway,</v>

1949
01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.690
<v Speaker 4>but the point being is then Israel </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there,</v>

1950
01:16:58.810 --> 01:16:59.980
<v Speaker 4>fort Apache,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bronx,</v>

1951
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 4>the Bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1952
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.633
<v Speaker 4>obviously Netanyahu and President Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not exactly the tightest of </v>

1953
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.400
<v Speaker 4>relationships and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1954
01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a lot of options.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they could look around and</v>

1955
01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:15.620
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1956
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 4>we'll align ourselves with somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 4>to protect our,</v>

1957
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.530
<v Speaker 4>what is obviously an existential threat </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>

1958
01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:23.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a lot of options.</v>

1959
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.853
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty much us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that kind of creates the </v>

1960
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:28.634
<v Speaker 4>environment that we currently existed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now obviously there's a feeling that </v>

1961
01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:36.770
<v Speaker 4>there's a bit of a sea change and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the US has recommitting itself to,</v>

1962
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:38.480
<v Speaker 4>to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to its alliance.</v>

1963
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:39.920
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the only democracy,</v>

1964
01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.380
<v Speaker 4>legitimate democracy out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1965
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1966
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.820
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like with any alliance,</v>

1967
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:48.650
<v Speaker 4>we should always be able to question and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1968
01:17:48.651 --> 01:17:49.484
<v Speaker 4>but we should understand that we've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make these things as tight so that </v>

1969
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.170
<v Speaker 4>there's no visible daylight between us </v>
<v Speaker 4>and our,</v>

1970
01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.004
<v Speaker 4>our key allies that others because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're always looking for that day </v>

1971
01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:00.750
<v Speaker 4>light that others could play off of and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1972
01:18:00.751 --> 01:18:03.620
<v Speaker 4>and look to take advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a,</v>

1973
01:18:03.621 --> 01:18:05.630
<v Speaker 4>that's a 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot look at,</v>

1974
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.370
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the region.</v>

1975
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:09.530
<v Speaker 4>It's very disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are six going on,</v>

1976
01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 4>seven failed states in the Middle East </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1977
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.673
<v Speaker 4>And every one of those poses in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>of threat to Israel because what are </v>

1978
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Libya,</v>

1979
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan,</v>

1980
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.470
<v Speaker 4>Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somalia has obviously done.</v>

1981
01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:28.730
<v Speaker 4>And when you say by failed states for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the uninitiated,</v>

1982
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.370
<v Speaker 4>what you mean is they essentially don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a real government.</v>

1983
01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:32.450
<v Speaker 4>There's no real government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1984
01:18:32.451 --> 01:18:34.510
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no sense of control.</v>

1985
01:18:34.511 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1986
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1987
01:18:36.981 --> 01:18:37.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1988
01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1989
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't get much in the press,</v>

1990
01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.013
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the previous administration had </v>

1991
01:18:43.071 --> 01:18:46.910
<v Speaker 4>no interest in talking about it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had pushed for,</v>

1992
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:50.640
<v Speaker 4>for the regime change in Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1993
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.200
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a disaster we had again,</v>

1994
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:55.040
<v Speaker 4>let's re.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1995
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to re litigate Iraq or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan or anything else.</v>

1996
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.350
<v Speaker 4>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a drastic mistake,</v>

1997
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.700
<v Speaker 4>but it goes back to what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier in revenue.</v>

1998
01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.553
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you were saying earlier was that </v>

1999
01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.093
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea that we shouldn't be involved </v>

2000
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:09.223
<v Speaker 4>in policing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with that is when you </v>

2001
01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:13.130
<v Speaker 4>pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you create this vacuum.</v>

2002
01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 4>When you remove leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as brutal as they are,</v>

2003
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:17.660
<v Speaker 4>you create a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2004
01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it was horrible,</v>

2005
01:19:18.801 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Saddam Hussein is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

2006
01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:21.973
<v Speaker 4>it was almost better for those people </v>
<v Speaker 4>when that guy was in power then having </v>

2007
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 4>what's going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially.</v>

2008
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds horrible to say so horrible to</v>

2009
01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:33.530
<v Speaker 4>say something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the same with Libya,</v>

2010
01:19:33.531 --> 01:19:34.670
<v Speaker 4>same with Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2011
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:36.170
<v Speaker 4>And the funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not funny,</v>

2012
01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:37.250
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say that that way.</v>

2013
01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 4>But the strange thing about Libya was </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gaddafi was working on our behalf in the</v>

2014
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.870
<v Speaker 4>world of counter terrorism for several </v>
<v Speaker 4>years leading up to his being removed,</v>

2015
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.570
<v Speaker 4>the only folks that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were involved in that exercise,</v>

2016
01:19:47.571 --> 01:19:48.404
<v Speaker 4>that really had national interests in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Libya where the French and the Italians </v>

2017
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.513
<v Speaker 4>and they somehow convinced the previous </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration to get involved and that </v>

2018
01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:56.464
<v Speaker 4>it was a good idea.</v>

2019
01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I mean like Libya has got what,</v>

2020
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:00.284
<v Speaker 4>a hundred and 30 some odd tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's even worse than a rock concert in </v>

2021
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.770
<v Speaker 4>sense of sort of a fractured tribal </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2022
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.330
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2023
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:09.890
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2024
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a disaster.</v>

2025
01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:11.913
<v Speaker 4>So what I mean by each failed stake </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially poses a threat to Israel is </v>

2026
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:19.730
<v Speaker 4>that what you get is you get the sucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sound as,</v>

2027
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.530
<v Speaker 4>as all the air leaves the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2028
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:23.453
<v Speaker 4>it becomes chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Chaos is where a group like the </v>

2029
01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:28.830
<v Speaker 4>Islamic state or al Qaeda or vocal </v>
<v Speaker 4>Harambe,</v>

2030
01:20:28.831 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 4>that's where the extremists make their </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

2031
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.040
<v Speaker 4>That's where they make their hay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>

2032
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.980
<v Speaker 4>they gravitate to places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2033
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's guaranteed.</v>

2034
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:41.300
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know how,</v>

2035
01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm just way above my pay grade when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about,</v>

2036
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:44.214
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does president trump do now with </v>

2037
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 4>the Middle East?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2038
01:20:45.961 --> 01:20:47.610
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he met with Madison,</v>

2039
01:20:47.611 --> 01:20:48.444
<v Speaker 4>he met with a bunch of folks over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pentagon today and one of the things he </v>

2040
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:51.080
<v Speaker 4>said is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2041
01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:51.913
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to take action and destroy </v>

2042
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 4>Islamic state.</v>

2043
01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that.</v>

2044
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:57.183
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of those things where it's a </v>

2045
01:20:57.661 --> 01:21:01.080
<v Speaker 4>nice sound bite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody should actually think that if</v>

2046
01:21:01.081 --> 01:21:05.160
<v Speaker 4>we somehow rid Iraq and Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Islamic state,</v>

2047
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.950
<v Speaker 4>that we've solved the problem and </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating another vacuum.</v>

2048
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then someone else would come in and </v>

2049
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:09.860
<v Speaker 4>fill it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you take a place like that and </v>

2051
01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:13.740
<v Speaker 4>turn it into a democracy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the real question,</v>

2052
01:21:13.741 --> 01:21:14.191
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:21:14.191 --> 01:21:18.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you'd do it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deeply ingrained behavior.</v>

2054
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me think about what it took for our,</v>

2055
01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:21.990
<v Speaker 4>for our nation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2056
01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we kind of want to every.</v>

2057
01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.144
<v Speaker 4>We got short attention span,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we just want everything to happen in </v>

2058
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:27.090
<v Speaker 4>an accelerated fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had to leave.</v>

2059
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have all democracy in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iraq or something.</v>

2060
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:31.723
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghans still don't have a clue what we </v>

2061
01:21:32.641 --> 01:21:33.474
<v Speaker 4>were trying to sell them.</v>

2062
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.403
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a fucking clue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a guy that worked for me when I </v>

2063
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:40.710
<v Speaker 4>started the business of business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>been up and running for about a year and</v>

2064
01:21:40.711 --> 01:21:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a Russian,</v>

2065
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on staff,</v>

2066
01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.830
<v Speaker 4>a very interesting cat was a former,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gru,</v>

2067
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.860
<v Speaker 4>military intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it had been a tank driver and he had</v>

2068
01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 4>been out in Afghanistan during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet occupation,</v>

2069
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:53.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was still carrying some,</v>

2070
01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:57.750
<v Speaker 4>some shrapnel around for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when we went into Tora Bora,</v>

2071
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.943
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2072
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.353
<v Speaker 4>I remember he came up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was visibly shaken and he said that </v>

2073
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:04.440
<v Speaker 4>was brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really brilliant,</v>

2074
01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:06.750
<v Speaker 4>but don't stay sister,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cockroaches,</v>

2075
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:10.480
<v Speaker 4>step on them over here and they come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>over here and you fucking step on it.</v>

2076
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.540
<v Speaker 4>And he was really literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can tell this guy just was,</v>

2077
01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

2078
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 4>he was starting to go off and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely correct.</v>

2079
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 4>We should have gone in there and did our</v>
<v Speaker 4>tactical mission,</v>

2080
01:22:19.261 --> 01:22:20.550
<v Speaker 4>which were very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very good at.</v>

2081
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:21.833
<v Speaker 4>And then left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we were feeling the pangs of guilt </v>

2082
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.670
<v Speaker 4>from having left previously after we had</v>
<v Speaker 4>that operation to get the Soviets out of</v>

2083
01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:32.220
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

2084
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:34.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2085
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:35.663
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those who are happy to admit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe if you sell shoulder fired </v>

2086
01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 4>weapons systems to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2087
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.773
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of folks in Afghanistan at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>point it's going to have to be a bad </v>

2088
01:22:44.521 --> 01:22:46.620
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to go back and buy him back.</v>

2089
01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a piece of work.</v>

2090
01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:49.314
<v Speaker 4>But Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>point being is we should have left at </v>

2091
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:51.924
<v Speaker 4>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we were feeling guilty about having </v>

2092
01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:54.750
<v Speaker 4>left before and the idea was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2093
01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:59.370
<v Speaker 4>if we just stayed than al Qaeda wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have found a home base in Afghanistan.</v>

2094
01:22:59.371 --> 01:23:00.204
<v Speaker 4>And who knows what we might've prevented</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the honest to God's truth as they </v>

2095
01:23:03.131 --> 01:23:04.740
<v Speaker 4>able to found a home base someplace </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

2096
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 4>And we would have just been sitting</v>

2097
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.100
<v Speaker 2>in Afghanistan for another 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2098
01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 2>The leading up to now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway.</v>

2099
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the most </v>

2100
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 2>frustrating things about international </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict when,</v>

2101
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.123
<v Speaker 2>when people start thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially people like me that have </v>

2102
01:23:18.071 --> 01:23:20.200
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look on the outside and you go,</v>

2103
01:23:20.201 --> 01:23:22.850
<v Speaker 2>how does this ever get resolved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does this ever get fit?</v>

2104
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Does it ever get fixed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2105
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>is it even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2106
01:23:26.771 --> 01:23:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to end.</v>

2107
01:23:28.271 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say it,</v>

2108
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm referring to Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism,</v>

2109
01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 2>jihadism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you wanna call it.</v>

2110
01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's not in our lifetime.</v>

2111
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:37.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in our lifetimes.</v>

2112
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's got to be on several levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying,</v>

2113
01:23:40.571 --> 01:23:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2114
01:23:42.221 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 2>there's that old saying you can't kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>your way out of it,</v>

2115
01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:45.064
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you can't make a good </v>

2116
01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 2>faith effort and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

2117
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:51.670
<v Speaker 2>but you have to work at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on other levels,</v>

2118
01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:52.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do,</v>

2119
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a meme right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

2120
01:23:56.471 --> 01:23:59.830
<v Speaker 2>we just remove that as well as my </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoiler on the house of cards.</v>

2121
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Who would have imagined that shows up 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

2122
01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I would've thought you'd seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

2123
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:07.303
<v Speaker 2>I just started a couple of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only on season two anyway with the </v>

2124
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:13.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2125
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2126
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:14.563
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget where I was going with that </v>

2127
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.800
<v Speaker 2>weed killing your way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2128
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:19.090
<v Speaker 2>But you have to work on other levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2129
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:20.050
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to fill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2130
01:24:20.051 --> 01:24:20.501
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2131
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:22.430
<v Speaker 2>You got to work with community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like we got to.</v>

2132
01:24:22.431 --> 01:24:23.264
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge lift and the local and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and the federal authorities here </v>

2133
01:24:26.171 --> 01:24:27.004
<v Speaker 2>in the US are actually spending a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time trying to build some level of </v>

2134
01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:34.600
<v Speaker 2>communication and trust with the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities here in this country because</v>

2135
01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2136
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:39.880
<v Speaker 2>if you just want to talk about somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>popping off and doing something horrible</v>

2137
01:24:39.881 --> 01:24:41.830
<v Speaker 2>here in our country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2138
01:24:41.831 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 2>the old concept of the lone wolf attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>

2139
01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.013
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your real only chance of identifying </v>

2140
01:24:49.241 --> 01:24:52.560
<v Speaker 2>that individual because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up on comms and they're not,</v>

2141
01:24:52.561 --> 01:24:54.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not on the radar already.</v>

2142
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.350
<v Speaker 2>They're not associating unless they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they do,</v>

2143
01:24:56.351 --> 01:24:57.184
<v Speaker 2>but usually they're not associating with</v>
<v Speaker 2>known targets and so your best bet is a </v>

2144
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:05.530
<v Speaker 2>mom or dad or a brother or sister </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up the phone and saying,</v>

2145
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2146
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whomever,</v>

2147
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.793
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's probably more likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen now after San Bernardino when </v>

2148
01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:12.784
<v Speaker 2>that San Bernardino attack and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that knew those folks </v>

2149
01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>were really into guns and St Louis a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of crazy shit,</v>

2150
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:21.070
<v Speaker 2>but they just wouldn't let me just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>outta here and nothing's going to happen</v>

2151
01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:21.904
<v Speaker 2>from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just leave these fucking ruins </v>

2152
01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.060
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they wound up,</v>

2153
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:26.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I also don't want to beat your </v>

2154
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:27.694
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>

2155
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wonderful new word.</v>

2156
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:32.523
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm a fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also use to people who have left </v>

2157
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

2158
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Really high end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hirsi Ali,</v>

2159
01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:39.730
<v Speaker 2>they call her Islamophobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:25:39.731 --> 01:25:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know she had female genital </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutilation when she was a baby.</v>

2161
01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:44.314
<v Speaker 2>They cut her clitoris off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's lived under that oppressive </v>

2162
01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:47.584
<v Speaker 2>regime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She risked her life to get outta there </v>

2163
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:49.893
<v Speaker 2>should we risked her life to come to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States and they still call her </v>

2164
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 2>and Islamophobia for anyone that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2165
01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:55.930
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fashionable.</v>

2166
01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:57.003
<v Speaker 2>Anyone says anything critical about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam by becoming an Islamophobia or a </v>

2167
01:26:00.011 --> 01:26:01.600
<v Speaker 2>bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a bigot.</v>

2168
01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.261
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2169
01:26:02.261 --> 01:26:03.094
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:04.123
<v Speaker 2>Somehow it's</v>

2171
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:04.961
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:26:04.961 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure how we got to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2173
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's the left,</v>

2174
01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>

2175
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like the far left gets nutty.</v>

2176
01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:14.510
<v Speaker 3>The far right gets nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far reaches of any ideologies.</v>

2177
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:15.620
<v Speaker 3>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2178
01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're blinded,</v>

2179
01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:17.853
<v Speaker 3>you're blinded by their beliefs and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are supported by other people who were </v>

2180
01:26:22.071 --> 01:26:24.340
<v Speaker 3>equally blinded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're,</v>

2181
01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.233
<v Speaker 3>you're right on the far edges is where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the zealots tend to reside for either </v>

2182
01:26:28.371 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the friend fringe.</v>

2183
01:26:31.851 --> 01:26:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we just came up with that.</v>

2184
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I think we can develop that theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>really have been around for a while.</v>

2185
01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 3>You're learning a lot of new stuff here </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

2187
01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's when you,</v>

2188
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.280
<v Speaker 3>when you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have this,</v>

2189
01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:46.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

2190
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:48.530
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a massive amount of experience when</v>

2191
01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:49.364
<v Speaker 3>it comes to foreign relations and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the almost like </v>

2192
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.220
<v Speaker 3>hopelessness of creating peace on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2193
01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.770
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that concept has always been.</v>

2194
01:26:57.771 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's always wanted peace on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all want,</v>

2195
01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:01.563
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you talk about the Middle East </v>

2196
01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:04.870
<v Speaker 3>and he talk about a hopeless that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you go back to like the fucking</v>

2197
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Carter administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back previous to that.</v>

2198
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like it's always been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mess.</v>

2199
01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2200
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.490
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2201
01:27:12.491 --> 01:27:13.324
<v Speaker 4>when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the relations that </v>

2202
01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:17.980
<v Speaker 4>these countries have amongst themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty fucked up.</v>

2203
01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:19.320
<v Speaker 4>And then you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2204
01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:22.060
<v Speaker 4>our relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our efforts with them and that's a whole</v>

2205
01:27:22.061 --> 01:27:23.590
<v Speaker 4>different level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>

2206
01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:25.310
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say it's,</v>

2207
01:27:25.311 --> 01:27:28.030
<v Speaker 4>it's never possible that's too </v>
<v Speaker 4>pessimistic,</v>

2208
01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.013
<v Speaker 4>but from a pragmatic point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we just have to be realistic in </v>

2209
01:27:33.491 --> 01:27:37.610
<v Speaker 4>our foreign policy and we have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we can to create allies to do,</v>

2210
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.753
<v Speaker 4>do our best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always acting in our own best interest </v>

2211
01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:45.040
<v Speaker 4>and just get away from this concept that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're somehow,</v>

2212
01:27:45.041 --> 01:27:48.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a community of nations all working </v>
<v Speaker 4>together for the good of the world.</v>

2213
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:51.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some groups do,</v>

2214
01:27:51.611 --> 01:27:52.444
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have your allies and that's a </v>

2215
01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:56.230
<v Speaker 4>great thing and we should always look to</v>
<v Speaker 4>promote that.</v>

2216
01:27:56.230 --> 01:27:58.930
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2217
01:27:58.931 --> 01:27:59.764
<v Speaker 4>ultimately I think we're the only nation</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it seems that apologizes when </v>

2218
01:28:02.831 --> 01:28:03.664
<v Speaker 4>we act in our own best interest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we almost feel like it's unseemly or </v>

2219
01:28:06.191 --> 01:28:08.350
<v Speaker 4>it's not the right thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Jesus or whatever.</v>

2220
01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:12.070
<v Speaker 4>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every other nation out there,</v>

2221
01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:15.820
<v Speaker 4>including our allies at closeouts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at it first and foremost,</v>

2222
01:28:15.821 --> 01:28:19.570
<v Speaker 4>how does this benefit me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does this benefit our country?</v>

2223
01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:24.220
<v Speaker 4>And if you just assume that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle in dealing in foreign policy,</v>

2224
01:28:24.610 --> 01:28:25.443
<v Speaker 4>and then you also assume that another </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle is that nothing is </v>

2225
01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:28.120
<v Speaker 4>unconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2226
01:28:28.121 --> 01:28:28.930
<v Speaker 4>everything's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2227
01:28:28.930 --> 01:28:29.763
<v Speaker 4>nothing happens in a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then with those two things as guiding </v>

2228
01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:33.043
<v Speaker 4>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta start to creating a foreign </v>

2229
01:28:35.921 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>policy that makes some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2230
01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.610
<v Speaker 4>and is beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2231
01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:40.151
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2232
01:28:40.151 --> 01:28:40.561
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2233
01:28:40.561 --> 01:28:41.394
<v Speaker 4>the difficulty is in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at what point do you exert your </v>

2234
01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:43.984
<v Speaker 4>influence?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At what point do you decide to be the </v>

2235
01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:45.970
<v Speaker 4>police person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2236
01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:46.300
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2237
01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.133
<v Speaker 3>it's not just evidence placement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good man I conversation about </v>

2238
01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:50.983
<v Speaker 3>Bradley team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've met Chelsea if you turned it </v>

2239
01:28:52.091 --> 01:28:54.520
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that that's evidence</v>

2240
01:28:54.521 --> 01:28:55.480
<v Speaker 3>of the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2241
01:28:55.481 --> 01:28:56.314
<v Speaker 3>it's because of the fact that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially the premier superpower in </v>

2242
01:28:59.741 --> 01:29:00.461
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's.</v>

2243
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else is a very distant second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's Kinda like where the big boss we</v>

2244
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 3>kind of have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2245
01:29:06.301 --> 01:29:09.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we probably shouldn't be doing that.</v>

2246
01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:09.973
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

2247
01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.940
<v Speaker 4>it is tough because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2248
01:29:13.330 --> 01:29:16.330
<v Speaker 4>I agree with those people to say we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be policing everywhere.</v>

2249
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.040
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about China and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good industry.</v>

2250
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say were the lone superpower,</v>

2251
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people would say,</v>

2252
01:29:21.281 --> 01:29:22.150
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about China?</v>

2253
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:23.800
<v Speaker 4>And uh oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just said it.</v>

2254
01:29:23.801 --> 01:29:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Like president trump does China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then part of China's problem is,</v>

2255
01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.330
<v Speaker 4>well they've got several,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one is that their economy,</v>

2256
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:32.443
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This idea that somehow they were going </v>

2257
01:29:33.091 --> 01:29:33.924
<v Speaker 4>to rise to the top of the heap in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world because of their economy I think </v>

2258
01:29:37.541 --> 01:29:39.640
<v Speaker 4>has always been flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of.</v>

2259
01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:40.503
<v Speaker 4>We spend a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My company spends a fair amount of time </v>

2260
01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:42.544
<v Speaker 4>looking at Chinese companies on behalf </v>
<v Speaker 4>of financial institutions and others </v>

2261
01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:48.590
<v Speaker 4>from outside of China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of smoke and mirrors,</v>

2262
01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:51.190
<v Speaker 4>a lot of bad paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're floating around.</v>

2263
01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.053
<v Speaker 4>They've got some problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really shaky problems in their </v>

2264
01:29:53.801 --> 01:29:54.634
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure and their economy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tied to that as a problem that if they </v>

2265
01:29:58.061 --> 01:29:58.894
<v Speaker 4>can't manage the slow down if they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if they can't manage and it's not </v>

2266
01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:04.690
<v Speaker 4>good for us either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we have to hope that they do.</v>

2267
01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:05.524
<v Speaker 4>But if they can't manage a slowdown and </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of that is in their economy and </v>

2268
01:30:08.141 --> 01:30:08.974
<v Speaker 4>part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is managing or putting a damper on </v>

2269
01:30:12.941 --> 01:30:14.590
<v Speaker 4>people's expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2270
01:30:14.591 --> 01:30:17.200
<v Speaker 4>they've kind of gotten away for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>time now with people thinking,</v>

2271
01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm rising up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm coming up out of the poverty class,</v>

2272
01:30:20.021 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting up to the middleclass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be real close.</v>

2273
01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only so far in that economy,</v>

2274
01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:25.690
<v Speaker 4>they're going to go and they've hit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>ceiling basically.</v>

2275
01:30:25.691 --> 01:30:26.524
<v Speaker 4>So they've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of discontent in a sense </v>

2276
01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:30.240
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of problems that they're,</v>

2277
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.273
<v Speaker 4>they're trying right now to mask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know whether they're gonna be </v>

2278
01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:34.750
<v Speaker 4>able to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we should all hope that,</v>

2279
01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.120
<v Speaker 4>that they're somewhat successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since again,</v>

2280
01:30:37.121 --> 01:30:39.130
<v Speaker 4>nothing happens in a bubble and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected.</v>

2281
01:30:39.131 --> 01:30:41.950
<v Speaker 4>So if they have significant problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can be issues.</v>

2282
01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:44.800
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I've never been,</v>

2283
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:45.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people say,</v>

2284
01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:46.274
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about trying to try and sort of a </v>

2285
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.270
<v Speaker 4>rising superpower along with us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2286
01:30:49.271 --> 01:30:50.380
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>militarily,</v>

2287
01:30:50.381 --> 01:30:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2288
01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.700
<v Speaker 4>but we're still way ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're still well ahead.</v>

2289
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.130
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it like a mutually assured</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction ahead thing.</v>

2290
01:30:59.131 --> 01:31:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were all fucked if we go to war.</v>

2291
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we really have a world war </v>
<v Speaker 3>that involves nuclear weapons,</v>

2292
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:06.530
<v Speaker 3>the whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

2293
01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except for right.</v>

2294
01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:09.893
<v Speaker 3>Come on up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of weird though that it's </v>

2295
01:31:12.001 --> 01:31:12.834
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mean we are the big super power as </v>

2296
01:31:15.451 --> 01:31:16.284
<v Speaker 3>long as none of these people like are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ran or Pakistan or anybody who has </v>

2297
01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:21.420
<v Speaker 3>nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as they don't launch anything,</v>

2298
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>as soon as they launched everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all fucked.</v>

2299
01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.250
<v Speaker 3>So we gotta kind of keep everybody from </v>
<v Speaker 3>launching everything.</v>

2300
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:28.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's really what,</v>

2301
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:29.833
<v Speaker 4>where the crisis is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The crisis isn't with us and Russia </v>

2302
01:31:31.791 --> 01:31:35.330
<v Speaker 4>going to war us in China going to war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the crisis is,</v>

2303
01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.253
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a smaller a nation with a nuclear </v>

2304
01:31:41.631 --> 01:31:44.630
<v Speaker 4>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm losing it's shit for doing something</v>

2305
01:31:44.631 --> 01:31:48.620
<v Speaker 4>stupid or some of those materials </v>
<v Speaker 4>falling into the wrong hands.</v>

2306
01:31:48.621 --> 01:31:51.890
<v Speaker 4>Those two scenarios are still the ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are most worrisome.</v>

2307
01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.350
<v Speaker 4>When you look at a country like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2308
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.860
<v Speaker 4>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at a country like Pakistan that</v>

2309
01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:56.763
<v Speaker 4>I was just going to bring them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if Pakistan didn't have nuclear </v>

2310
01:31:58.521 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 4>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would not</v>

2311
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.650
<v Speaker 2>really be all that interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan,</v>

2312
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:04.600
<v Speaker 2>a sketchy place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2313
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Shane Smith was telling me about Jane </v>
<v Speaker 2>Smith,</v>

2314
01:32:06.671 --> 01:32:07.504
<v Speaker 2>the head of vice was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does that one city in Pakistan </v>

2315
01:32:10.811 --> 01:32:11.644
<v Speaker 2>that he was talking about that he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>is essentially the most dangerous spot </v>

2316
01:32:14.801 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 2>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2317
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:18.210
<v Speaker 2>there are so many murders created in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

2318
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Then you can [inaudible] you was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told them.</v>

2319
01:32:19.641 --> 01:32:20.474
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just saying it's an insanely </v>

2320
01:32:22.901 --> 01:32:24.860
<v Speaker 2>dangerous murderous place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2321
01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2322
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's A.</v>

2323
01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Although there are parts of Pakistan </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have beautiful.</v>

2324
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And parts of Elo hell are probably nice </v>

2325
01:32:33.371 --> 01:32:37.510
<v Speaker 2>to a nice spot outside of the lava side </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the lava.</v>

2326
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

2327
01:32:38.981 --> 01:32:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's those,</v>

2328
01:32:41.171 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 2>it's those places like Pakistan that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have Iran.</v>

2329
01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:48.730
<v Speaker 2>They continue their march.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that somehow that at agreement</v>

2330
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.420
<v Speaker 2>stop them from developing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2331
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.810
<v Speaker 2>even though even the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration couldn't keep that,</v>

2332
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll up any.</v>

2333
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Are you worried about Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:32:55.901 --> 01:32:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2335
01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the sense that,</v>

2336
01:32:58.590 --> 01:33:01.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again they're continuing their,</v>

2337
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:04.270
<v Speaker 2>they're testing their ballistic systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're obviously,</v>

2338
01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:05.104
<v Speaker 2>I think they're still continuing </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning centrifuges and we don't know </v>

2339
01:33:07.691 --> 01:33:09.490
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a lot of hot women though.</v>

2340
01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.091
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Well there is at so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2342
01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.050
<v Speaker 2>it was hot Persian broads to come over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2343
01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:15.641
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Persians.</v>

2344
01:33:15.641 --> 01:33:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some other bodies like the,</v>

2345
01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.170
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make them good.</v>

2346
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2347
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:22.900
<v Speaker 2>stout genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:33:22.901 --> 01:33:24.030
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2349
01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2350
01:33:25.241 --> 01:33:25.821
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2351
01:33:25.821 --> 01:33:27.640
<v Speaker 2>it's how do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you account for that?</v>

2352
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:30.550
<v Speaker 2>You're a dangerous nuclear power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got these really hot women so</v>

2353
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 2>we have put the two of them together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make something happen.</v>

2354
01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2355
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.620
<v Speaker 2>There was something like Bill Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it happen.</v>

2356
01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.800
<v Speaker 2>There was something that was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a.</v>

2357
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:42.663
<v Speaker 2>trump was really like openly criticized </v>
<v Speaker 2>for saying that he wants to put America </v>

2358
01:33:46.361 --> 01:33:47.090
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

2359
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:49.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was so strange and people</v>

2360
01:33:49.361 --> 01:33:50.194
<v Speaker 2>were saying it like it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most horrible things a president has </v>

2361
01:33:52.691 --> 01:33:55.390
<v Speaker 2>ever said ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got so confused by that.</v>

2362
01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:56.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that what every country says all </v>

2363
01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.013
<v Speaker 2>over the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want them to put America second </v>

2364
01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:03.980
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the top five?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2365
01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixth.</v>

2366
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.093
<v Speaker 2>Is that like really being a altruistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what does that mean by someone </v>

2367
01:34:10.901 --> 01:34:13.000
<v Speaker 2>being upset that he wants to put America</v>
<v Speaker 2>first?</v>

2368
01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2369
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.870
<v Speaker 2>if there's bad treaties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's bad agreements,</v>

2370
01:34:16.871 --> 01:34:17.704
<v Speaker 2>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's anything that doesn't favor </v>

2371
01:34:19.451 --> 01:34:20.284
<v Speaker 2>us or our economy or our safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you want them to put </v>

2372
01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:26.620
<v Speaker 2>America first?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really weird.</v>

2373
01:34:26.650 --> 01:34:27.483
<v Speaker 2>Here's where I think we are with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm completely wrong on this </v>

2374
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:30.304
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if Donald Trump was any other </v>

2375
01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:33.123
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America first would not be construed as </v>

2376
01:34:36.311 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people,</v>

2377
01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I think the far left construes it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist because he's a white guy,</v>

2378
01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:43.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything through race,</v>

2379
01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.400
<v Speaker 2>they view everything through race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm concerned.</v>

2380
01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:46.443
<v Speaker 2>You think of Obama said that they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he's being conciliatory to the </v>

2381
01:34:48.431 --> 01:34:49.264
<v Speaker 2>ride and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's like trying to drum up paper </v>

2382
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:55.150
<v Speaker 2>patriotism or say look at he's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire up the economy.</v>

2383
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 2>It's all about jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it would be,</v>

2384
01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:58.334
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2385
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.320
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think it would have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same impact.</v>

2386
01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 4>And I think if Hillary Clinton said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she would get a pass,</v>

2387
01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.090
<v Speaker 4>but I think you're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2388
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:07.603
<v Speaker 4>some crazy shit about Russia that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be able to respond militarily to </v>

2389
01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:13.610
<v Speaker 4>the cyber attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2390
01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:14.773
<v Speaker 4>you really can't say shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And apparently what was sad was that </v>

2391
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 4>they had said to the Russian people they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were in contact with,</v>

2392
01:35:21.681 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all just rhetoric to worry about</v>

2393
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:24.500
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2394
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:25.483
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's really how it </v>

2395
01:35:27.441 --> 01:35:28.330
<v Speaker 4>goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2396
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2397
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:33.140
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty crazy shit when you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to imagine what's that line where</v>

2398
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:34.243
<v Speaker 4>another nation engages in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cyber shenanigans and we're gonna </v>

2399
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.273
<v Speaker 4>respond militarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Pentagon is still trying to figure </v>

2400
01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:40.004
<v Speaker 4>that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One guy has been working on this for </v>

2401
01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:42.950
<v Speaker 4>some time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's don't try and draw this her,</v>

2402
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.130
<v Speaker 4>so they haven't done it either.</v>

2403
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.060
<v Speaker 4>But the idea of what are your protocols </v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

2404
01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:49.490
<v Speaker 4>for a cybersecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for cyber attacks,</v>

2405
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:51.270
<v Speaker 4>cyber warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2406
01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:54.560
<v Speaker 4>they're still trying to figure that out </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so freaking difficult.</v>

2407
01:35:54.561 --> 01:35:56.210
<v Speaker 4>But think about in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>instance,</v>

2408
01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:58.820
<v Speaker 4>what we're talking about is not really </v>
<v Speaker 4>cyber warfare.</v>

2409
01:35:58.821 --> 01:36:00.950
<v Speaker 4>It's someone getting a hold of some </v>
<v Speaker 4>emails.</v>

2410
01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.870
<v Speaker 4>So you read my emails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to launch a bomb at you.</v>

2411
01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.960
<v Speaker 4>It would have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping,</v>

2412
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 4>I would think threshold will be higher </v>
<v Speaker 4>than that,</v>

2413
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.513
<v Speaker 4>but it taking down infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to look at it from a </v>

2414
01:36:12.591 --> 01:36:13.850
<v Speaker 4>simplistic point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2415
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:15.770
<v Speaker 4>that's really what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2416
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:16.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2417
01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's where you're right,</v>

2418
01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:18.644
<v Speaker 4>the rhetorics got and you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can engage in that sort of </v>

2419
01:36:20.721 --> 01:36:22.710
<v Speaker 4>conversation or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2420
01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:26.060
<v Speaker 4>that's why I would like to think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the new president would have,</v>

2421
01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:28.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or start to have more.</v>

2422
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:29.683
<v Speaker 4>And I think it may be happening more </v>
<v Speaker 4>discipline and sort of the messaging </v>

2423
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.290
<v Speaker 4>because you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

2424
01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 4>you can't say shit out there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2425
01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:36.254
<v Speaker 4>that was driving me crazy because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would tell that to my friends who were </v>

2426
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Hillary supporters and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2427
01:36:39.781 --> 01:36:41.330
<v Speaker 4>they would try to ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2428
01:36:41.331 --> 01:36:44.740
<v Speaker 4>how can you ignore that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a fucking crazy statement if you</v>

2429
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:45.583
<v Speaker 4>have my email,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to launch the military at </v>

2430
01:36:47.451 --> 01:36:48.370
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it,</v>

2431
01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.393
<v Speaker 4>there's still confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you think about there was a </v>

2432
01:36:50.811 --> 01:36:55.040
<v Speaker 4>cyber attack by a nation state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a against our electrical grid,</v>

2433
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:56.540
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took down the,</v>

2434
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:57.383
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only three grids in this </v>

2435
01:36:57.861 --> 01:36:59.180
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>east West in Texas.</v>

2436
01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:01.610
<v Speaker 4>So they took down the east grid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of anything.</v>

2437
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:02.803
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's a serious and coordinated in a </v>

2438
01:37:06.170 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may be down for three,</v>

2439
01:37:09.831 --> 01:37:10.491
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

2440
01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:11.324
<v Speaker 4>six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven weeks could be longer because we </v>

2441
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 4>don't manufacture a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gear for the system anymore.</v>

2442
01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:16.753
<v Speaker 4>Here in this country we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're putting lipstick on a pig for the </v>

2443
01:37:20.441 --> 01:37:23.510
<v Speaker 4>most of the patchwork quilt of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the power grid.</v>

2444
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fairly frail thing anyway,</v>

2445
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.840
<v Speaker 4>but if they take that down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you think to yourself,</v>

2446
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we respond to,</v>

2447
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:32.460
<v Speaker 4>we do the same to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2448
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:35.390
<v Speaker 4>the attacking nation that engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2449
01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:38.990
<v Speaker 4>Do we respond militarily?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where the,</v>

2450
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:39.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2451
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:42.050
<v Speaker 4>the Pentagon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been sitting there trying to figure</v>

2452
01:37:42.051 --> 01:37:43.160
<v Speaker 4>out how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do,</v>

2453
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.050
<v Speaker 4>what are the protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the responses,</v>

2454
01:37:45.051 --> 01:37:48.560
<v Speaker 4>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what line do we need to see before we.</v>

2455
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:49.663
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2456
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:52.200
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole different world and this is</v>

2457
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 4>something to really pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because going forward when talk about,</v>

2458
01:37:55.651 --> 01:37:56.011
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2459
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:58.890
<v Speaker 4>maybe something happens and you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>people starting to launch nukes.</v>

2460
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe again,</v>

2461
01:38:00.481 --> 01:38:01.314
<v Speaker 4>you get some crazy as a leader of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>small nation that decides to do </v>

2462
01:38:04.771 --> 01:38:06.540
<v Speaker 4>something or they get overrun and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2463
01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:07.980
<v Speaker 4>it falls into bad hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2464
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:12.630
<v Speaker 4>But more likely than not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen is something that</v>

2465
01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:17.631
<v Speaker 4>spins out of Control in cyberspace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because we either,</v>

2466
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.073
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we overreact or we under react and then </v>

2467
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 4>we were playing catch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

2468
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:24.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a constant game of arbitration and </v>

2469
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:32.670
<v Speaker 3>coordinated communication and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>soothe things out,</v>

2470
01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 3>keep things from getting too crazy,</v>

2471
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.280
<v Speaker 4>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2472
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I sometimes make fun of diplomacy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but diplomacy is very,</v>

2473
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:39.684
<v Speaker 4>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to have those </v>

2474
01:38:40.111 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 4>communication channels open all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2475
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:43.820
<v Speaker 4>People have to be talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2476
01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2477
01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 4>Intel services talk to each other all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2478
01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:47.124
<v Speaker 4>Even when you know two countries or even</v>
<v Speaker 4>when us in another country going at it </v>

2479
01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:50.650
<v Speaker 4>in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2480
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:52.010
<v Speaker 4>or we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2481
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:54.660
<v Speaker 4>the Intel services tend to be at working</v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

2482
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.673
<v Speaker 4>keeping that line of communication </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they know it's pretty serious </v>

2483
01:38:57.511 --> 01:38:58.344
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to do that and things can get </v>

2484
01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.140
<v Speaker 4>sideways really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fast out there.</v>

2485
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.620
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2486
01:39:02.621 --> 01:39:03.800
<v Speaker 4>you got to hope that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2487
01:39:03.801 --> 01:39:06.300
<v Speaker 4>the conversations continue and we've got</v>
<v Speaker 4>good people.</v>

2488
01:39:06.301 --> 01:39:10.980
<v Speaker 4>I look at the new administration sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>second and third tier folks,</v>

2489
01:39:10.981 --> 01:39:12.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were crap actually gets done,</v>

2490
01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:13.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the cabinet level or anything but </v>

2491
01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.320
<v Speaker 4>the down second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third tier.</v>

2492
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:19.590
<v Speaker 4>And they brought in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some good pragmatic people.</v>

2493
01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:21.330
<v Speaker 4>They've got some smart folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They understand.</v>

2494
01:39:21.331 --> 01:39:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I think the way the world works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're measured in their response.</v>

2495
01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does any of that matter?</v>

2496
01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:28.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the president is,</v>

2497
01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:29.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be,</v>

2498
01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:30.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy Lewis County.</v>

2499
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's his own guy and all he's gonna make</v>

2500
01:39:32.551 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 4>his own decision or if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

2501
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:35.730
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2502
01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:36.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know this,</v>

2503
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.720
<v Speaker 4>this caught everybody by surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So didn't really.</v>

2504
01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 4>No one saw it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there were a handful of people.</v>

2505
01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:44.430
<v Speaker 4>I think there were four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four people in the entire country.</v>

2506
01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2507
01:39:46.381 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else who said,</v>

2508
01:39:47.401 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew this was going to happen.</v>

2509
01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:49.524
<v Speaker 4>They're just blowing smoke up your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there were very small </v>

2510
01:39:51.721 --> 01:39:53.580
<v Speaker 4>number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that actually saw it.</v>

2511
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:56.010
<v Speaker 4>This was developing and what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen now.</v>

2512
01:39:56.011 --> 01:39:58.200
<v Speaker 4>I had friends that jumped on the trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>train early,</v>

2513
01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.450
<v Speaker 4>really early back in when you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2514
01:40:00.490 --> 01:40:02.610
<v Speaker 4>you're what you're doing what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2515
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:04.610
<v Speaker 4>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2516
01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:08.520
<v Speaker 4>did they see something or were they just</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for a campaign they could ride?</v>

2517
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:10.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2518
01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:12.020
<v Speaker 4>that is part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2519
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.511
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2520
01:40:12.511 --> 01:40:12.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2521
01:40:12.781 --> 01:40:14.120
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's looking for a job in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2522
01:40:14.121 --> 01:40:14.570
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2523
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:15.260
<v Speaker 4>in a sense.</v>

2524
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.093
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also,</v>

2525
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've noticed this </v>
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>

2526
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:22.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of weird sort of now</v>
<v Speaker 3>now very obvious right wing guys,</v>

2527
01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:29.650
<v Speaker 3>but people that were just sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>online commentators or they would have a</v>

2528
01:40:29.811 --> 01:40:30.644
<v Speaker 3>blog or a little of this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when it kind of became a </v>

2529
01:40:34.251 --> 01:40:37.070
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this trump thing became a movement.</v>

2530
01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:38.233
<v Speaker 3>All of their stuff got really pro trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they started using words like cock </v>

2531
01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.333
<v Speaker 3>column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>People Cox and like and fallen into </v>

2532
01:40:45.411 --> 01:40:46.160
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2533
01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:46.993
<v Speaker 3>these camps where you're just seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these tribal sort of behavior patterns </v>

2534
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:52.123
<v Speaker 3>play out.</v>

2535
01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:52.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2536
01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2537
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 2>And some of that is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you again,</v>

2538
01:40:56.951 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you've got people that are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2539
01:40:58.301 --> 01:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could actually happen.</v>

2540
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Would like a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be on the winning side.</v>

2541
01:41:01.901 --> 01:41:02.734
<v Speaker 2>I like to jump on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be one of the people </v>

2542
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:07.660
<v Speaker 2>considered as an ally instead of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy.</v>

2543
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:10.330
<v Speaker 2>And I find that that's the way the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

2544
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I guess our though it's bizarre to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

2545
01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2546
01:41:13.061 --> 01:41:13.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2547
01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:14.464
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2548
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:19.660
<v Speaker 4>early on I signed onto a national </v>
<v Speaker 4>security letter with some other folks,</v>

2549
01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.960
<v Speaker 4>basically said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2550
01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.860
<v Speaker 4>we didn't believe that a Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now president trump,</v>

2551
01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the right candidate for,</v>

2552
01:41:25.991 --> 01:41:27.940
<v Speaker 4>from a national security perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2553
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:30.420
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2554
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:31.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2555
01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:32.940
<v Speaker 4>I took some heat for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2556
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.813
<v Speaker 4>but some of those folks are now looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>for jobs in the administration and I </v>

2557
01:41:36.551 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it,</v>

2558
01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 4>what did you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I will say this much,</v>

2559
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.790
<v Speaker 4>I once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2560
01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 4>once the person wins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is maybe where,</v>

2561
01:41:48.401 --> 01:41:49.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2562
01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time understanding some of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the angst that's out there.</v>

2563
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Once the president gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a duty to,</v>

2564
01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work and make the country,</v>

2565
01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go forward and work.</v>

2566
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:01.293
<v Speaker 4>And so I've got no problem supporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the administration in the sense that I </v>

2567
01:42:03.521 --> 01:42:04.480
<v Speaker 4>want them to do well.</v>

2568
01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.030
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think there's anything in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Congress with that and in the sense that</v>

2569
01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2570
01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't my candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2571
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now that he's in,</v>

2572
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.490
<v Speaker 4>I want this place to do well and so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want this administration to do well.</v>

2573
01:42:15.491 --> 01:42:16.324
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad that they've got good people </v>

2574
01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:18.700
<v Speaker 4>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2575
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.863
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still say there's gonna be things and </v>

2576
01:42:22.741 --> 01:42:23.650
<v Speaker 4>he's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say,</v>

2577
01:42:23.651 --> 01:42:24.221
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great,</v>

2578
01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excellent.</v>

2579
01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:26.490
<v Speaker 4>And there's going to be things he </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't know.</v>

2580
01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 4>What the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2581
01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:29.974
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can't be in that position and </v>

2582
01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:35.410
<v Speaker 4>you've always got to be all onboard or </v>
<v Speaker 4>all against,</v>

2583
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how people live</v>

2584
01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:39.000
<v Speaker 2>that way and that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

2585
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.133
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's possible that he could</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull this off and he could be a good </v>

2586
01:42:42.331 --> 01:42:43.164
<v Speaker 2>president and he could listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>advice of the people that actually know </v>

2587
01:42:45.151 --> 01:42:47.580
<v Speaker 2>how the world works and stay off </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter?</v>

2588
01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's possible to stay off </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

2589
01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that old scorpion right on the</v>

2590
01:42:52.501 --> 01:42:55.740
<v Speaker 2>back of the tweets with sad anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sad.</v>

2591
01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.900
<v Speaker 2>He can't say that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to stop that.</v>

2592
01:42:57.901 --> 01:43:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I can't just say sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that shit's going to end.</v>

2593
01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:01.253
<v Speaker 2>But could you surprise people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could good things happen as a result of </v>

2594
01:43:03.901 --> 01:43:05.830
<v Speaker 2>a change in administrations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2595
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:07.070
<v Speaker 2>could the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2596
01:43:07.071 --> 01:43:08.940
<v Speaker 2>it gets see a bump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could we?</v>

2597
01:43:08.941 --> 01:43:09.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2598
01:43:09.601 --> 01:43:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it happens.</v>

2599
01:43:10.771 --> 01:43:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I really do hope it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really whole.</v>

2600
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:15.360
<v Speaker 2>P really does commit to rebuilding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>

2601
01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:16.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think could get a lot of </v>

2602
01:43:17.761 --> 01:43:20.190
<v Speaker 2>great jobs and would do a lot of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>

2603
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:21.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2604
01:43:21.001 --> 01:43:21.834
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent.</v>

2605
01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roads,</v>

2606
01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:25.880
<v Speaker 2>bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pipes,</v>

2607
01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:27.030
<v Speaker 2>water pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2608
01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:27.953
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's,</v>

2609
01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.990
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he goes in that direction,</v>

2610
01:43:30.991 --> 01:43:32.950
<v Speaker 4>if we see that now again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got people questioning that,</v>

2611
01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:34.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of the spending.</v>

2612
01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2613
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:39.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jury's out on and um,</v>

2614
01:43:39.610 --> 01:43:41.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they do with taxes,</v>

2615
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.960
<v Speaker 4>it seems like they're going to go in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>decent direction on the,</v>

2616
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:46.890
<v Speaker 4>on the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2617
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:48.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it could.</v>

2618
01:43:48.271 --> 01:43:49.104
<v Speaker 4>I think it could surprise people because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what are missing is they see </v>

2619
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a lot of chaos,</v>

2620
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:59.360
<v Speaker 4>but you could also argue it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a beneficial thing to have</v>

2621
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:00.194
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people talking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a light because they do seem </v>

2622
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 4>willing to listen to a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2623
01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.510
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least early stage.</v>

2624
01:44:05.511 --> 01:44:06.880
<v Speaker 4>I realized I could change or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2625
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:07.933
<v Speaker 4>and I don't wanna make too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do seem like there's a lot of </v>

2626
01:44:10.671 --> 01:44:12.980
<v Speaker 4>different voices that are being dragged </v>
<v Speaker 4>in and saying,</v>

2627
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about this?</v>

2628
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's going to make his own decision,</v>

2629
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.620
<v Speaker 4>but we get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't see those things happen.</v>

2630
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.513
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the discussions that they've </v>

2631
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:22.630
<v Speaker 4>already started about how do we re,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2632
01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.490
<v Speaker 4>align the Intel community so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>more efficient,</v>

2633
01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 4>more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good conversation to have.</v>

2634
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:30.370
<v Speaker 4>But we don't see that because people get</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost in the tweets and they get lost in,</v>

2635
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:32.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the various headline of the day,</v>

2636
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:34.410
<v Speaker 4>the cult of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there is.</v>

2637
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:35.420
<v Speaker 4>And there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be fair,</v>

2638
01:44:35.421 --> 01:44:38.540
<v Speaker 4>there's a media out there that wants him</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fail as soon as possible.</v>

2639
01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.433
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were just hoping that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to think that is because he's </v>

2640
01:44:41.271 --> 01:44:43.700
<v Speaker 4>criticizing them because he's openly </v>
<v Speaker 4>going into the war with them.</v>

2641
01:44:43.701 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's it.</v>

2642
01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:48.050
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean.</v>

2643
01:44:48.051 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 4>Let's be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not,</v>

2644
01:44:49.101 --> 01:44:50.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying anything that people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be shocked by,</v>

2645
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this was not.</v>

2646
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Their candidate never would be the e </v>
<v Speaker 4>stands for everything they don't like.</v>

2647
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:59.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2648
01:44:59.290 --> 01:45:01.430
<v Speaker 4>a part of the media is very insular </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously.</v>

2649
01:45:01.431 --> 01:45:02.264
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all stuff that people know so </v>

2650
01:45:03.690 --> 01:45:06.770
<v Speaker 4>it's no surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a large portion of the media</v>

2651
01:45:06.771 --> 01:45:07.604
<v Speaker 4>out there that really wants him to fail </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're actively working towards </v>

2652
01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:14.480
<v Speaker 4>that end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

2653
01:45:14.481 --> 01:45:15.980
<v Speaker 4>you could go back to the previous </v>
<v Speaker 4>administration and say,</v>

2654
01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:18.250
<v Speaker 4>well look what Fox News was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were always questioning president,</v>

2655
01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:19.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was one voice,</v>

2656
01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:20.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

2657
01:45:20.151 --> 01:45:23.180
<v Speaker 4>And some talk radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Eh,</v>

2658
01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2659
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.000
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a good chance,</v>

2660
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:26.983
<v Speaker 4>a good chance there's a chance that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>president could turn out to be a lot </v>

2661
01:45:30.021 --> 01:45:31.040
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2662
01:45:31.170 --> 01:45:32.003
<v Speaker 4>there's probably a good chance it'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn out to be better than people </v>

2663
01:45:34.401 --> 01:45:35.760
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2664
01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2665
01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:39.140
<v Speaker 4>you would like to think that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>would want that to happen,</v>

2666
01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:40.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who sits around and hopes it.</v>

2667
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.013
<v Speaker 4>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2668
01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.090
<v Speaker 4>there were people on the right that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted Obama to fail.</v>

2669
01:45:44.091 --> 01:45:44.924
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2670
01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:46.940
<v Speaker 4>that course again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's what we're talking about before</v>

2671
01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:47.570
<v Speaker 4>when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2672
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:51.740
<v Speaker 4>sort of the zealots on each side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand that mentality.</v>

2673
01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:52.401
<v Speaker 4>So it's around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I says,</v>

2674
01:45:52.401 --> 01:45:55.850
<v Speaker 4>I hope this guy fucks up really because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're living here,</v>

2675
01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:56.800
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2676
01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.600
<v Speaker 4>and this is your country and you got </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids and you just want to say,</v>

2677
01:45:59.601 --> 01:46:00.620
<v Speaker 4>I told you so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2678
01:46:00.621 --> 01:46:01.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2679
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.890
<v Speaker 4>They want the other side to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want the other team,</v>

2680
01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:05.880
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem is they're looking at</v>

2681
01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.300
<v Speaker 4>as the other team instead of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>as one big team.</v>

2682
01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Once it gets in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2683
01:46:10.290 --> 01:46:11.990
<v Speaker 4>we're supposed to be all on the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

2684
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Once a guy gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might criticize his movements,</v>

2685
01:46:14.781 --> 01:46:18.980
<v Speaker 4>you might criticize his decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately you should want him to do</v>

2686
01:46:18.981 --> 01:46:19.814
<v Speaker 4>well because it will be good for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire country and you can disagree on </v>

2687
01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.440
<v Speaker 4>policy is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2688
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.753
<v Speaker 4>if you disagree then find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out there and do something </v>

2689
01:46:27.411 --> 01:46:28.280
<v Speaker 4>constructive about it.</v>

2690
01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.150
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean a donate or oh,</v>

2691
01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:32.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working uh,</v>

2692
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:35.300
<v Speaker 4>some sort of volunteer position or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2693
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.430
<v Speaker 4>canvass your neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the political thing?</v>

2694
01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean people made a lot of fun of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tea party,</v>

2695
01:46:39.171 --> 01:46:40.004
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tea party did what you're supposed </v>

2696
01:46:41.271 --> 01:46:44.000
<v Speaker 4>to do in a democratic society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They organized,</v>

2697
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:47.560
<v Speaker 4>they know politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they worked,</v>

2698
01:46:47.561 --> 01:46:51.240
<v Speaker 4>they canvassed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got representatives elected and,</v>

2699
01:46:51.241 --> 01:46:52.074
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pushed their agenda in a proper </v>

2700
01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:54.750
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fuck it.</v>

2701
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the far left or get over.</v>

2702
01:46:56.911 --> 01:46:59.400
<v Speaker 4>It's butthurt and they'll actually start</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that shit.</v>

2703
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:00.263
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2704
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:01.363
<v Speaker 3>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it just leads to more </v>

2705
01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:04.670
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more debate,</v>

2706
01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:08.240
<v Speaker 3>more communication and more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a better understanding of how the</v>

2707
01:47:08.241 --> 01:47:09.074
<v Speaker 3>system works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if one thing that we can look </v>

2708
01:47:10.641 --> 01:47:11.474
<v Speaker 3>forward to with trump is that he's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>transparent and if something pisses him </v>

2709
01:47:15.231 --> 01:47:17.660
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's immediately going to talk about it,</v>

2710
01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:21.500
<v Speaker 3>that we're going to get to see more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand more about it,</v>

2711
01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.850
<v Speaker 3>how it works behind the scenes.</v>

2712
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:23.731
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2713
01:47:23.731 --> 01:47:24.420
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's right.</v>

2714
01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:29.000
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people look at and you know,</v>

2715
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 4>unless they hate them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at that as a positive and they</v>

2716
01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:32.071
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

2717
01:47:32.071 --> 01:47:32.904
<v Speaker 4>I'm Api that he's out there tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I want them to bypass the </v>

2718
01:47:35.401 --> 01:47:37.760
<v Speaker 4>media and tell me what's going on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that sort of thing.</v>

2719
01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:38.613
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think he genuinely believes that </v>

2720
01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:43.770
<v Speaker 4>that was a big a part of why he got </v>
<v Speaker 4>elected.</v>

2721
01:47:43.771 --> 01:47:45.760
<v Speaker 4>So he's not going to change that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would or.</v>

2722
01:47:45.761 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2723
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:48.650
<v Speaker 3>So love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get crazy when look,</v>

2724
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.870
<v Speaker 3>everybody looks at someone who's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

2725
01:47:50.871 --> 01:47:53.630
<v Speaker 3>whether they're the president or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

2726
01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:56.630
<v Speaker 3>They look at them as being some </v>
<v Speaker 3>irreproachable.</v>

2727
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:57.763
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some person have like much higher moral </v>

2728
01:48:00.381 --> 01:48:03.560
<v Speaker 3>cloth and value and an intellect and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>see him.</v>

2729
01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:04.900
<v Speaker 3>He's clearly not right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2730
01:48:04.901 --> 01:48:07.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets mad with he such shit.</v>

2733

<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2734
01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:13.790
<v Speaker 4>And that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that drives the media crazy.</v>

2735
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:14.663
<v Speaker 4>It drives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it drives the academics and others on </v>

2736
01:48:16.601 --> 01:48:20.420
<v Speaker 4>the that have typically occupied the far</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

2737

<v Speaker 4>fragile,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so stupid.</v>

2743
01:48:30.381 --> 01:48:32.480
<v Speaker 4>And he appeals to all the stupid people </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

2746
01:48:35.211 --> 01:48:38.840
<v Speaker 4>president trump by spending eight years </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling people how stupid they are.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2749
01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:43.070

<v Speaker 4>making fun of them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

2753
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 3>definitely a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2754
01:48:49.981 --> 01:48:51.750
<v Speaker 3>he played off of that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliantly.</v>

2755
01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.210
<v Speaker 3>He's a very smart persuader in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>

2756
01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:55.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott Adams,</v>

2757
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.823
<v Speaker 3>who is the creator of Dilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who predicted this whole thing a long </v>

2758
01:48:59.401 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 3>time in advance and took a big hit for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2759
01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 3>told me it cost them millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

2760
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:06.780
<v Speaker 3>People boycotting him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hating him,</v>

2761
01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:07.883
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't even vote because he's not </v>

2762
01:49:09.871 --> 01:49:10.830
<v Speaker 3>voting for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2763
01:49:10.831 --> 01:49:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have a dog in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2764
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have a dog in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2765
01:49:14.161 --> 01:49:14.994
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be objective about it if I don't </v>

2766
01:49:16.801 --> 01:49:20.250
<v Speaker 3>talk about it or if I don't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's not voting.</v>

2767
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:22.290
<v Speaker 3>He didn't vote for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't vote for anybody,</v>

2768
01:49:22.291 --> 01:49:23.124
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he thinks is that trump is an </v>

2769
01:49:25.410 --> 01:49:27.180
<v Speaker 3>excellent persuader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2770
01:49:27.181 --> 01:49:27.730
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

2771
01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:29.840
<v Speaker 3>His powers of persuasion are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2772
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.953
<v Speaker 3>And he goes into the way he understands </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to manipulate the press and say </v>

2773
01:49:33.211 --> 01:49:35.190
<v Speaker 3>outrageous things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they talk about him constantly.</v>

2774
01:49:35.191 --> 01:49:36.960
<v Speaker 3>So he gets free press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2775
01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:40.330
<v Speaker 3>what he did in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott was totally right and he was like,</v>

2776
01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.540
<v Speaker 3>Scott was looking at it completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective.</v>

2777
01:49:42.541 --> 01:49:43.374
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a trump supporter and many </v>

2778
01:49:44.581 --> 01:49:45.414
<v Speaker 3>people accused them of being so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why he got took so much heat </v>

2779
01:49:47.141 --> 01:49:47.740
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2780
01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 3>he's going</v>

2781
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:49.420
<v Speaker 2>to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

2782
01:49:49.421 --> 01:49:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you're a piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they hated him because of it.</v>

2783
01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:54.280
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating because when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to know Scott,</v>

2784
01:49:54.281 --> 01:49:55.114
<v Speaker 2>you realize he's a brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's unafraid to discuss what he </v>

2785
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:01.054
<v Speaker 2>actually believes will take place </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not people </v>

2786
01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>think that's what they want or what am I</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

2787
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:07.984
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that about them to really </v>

2788
01:50:09.851 --> 01:50:12.640
<v Speaker 2>enter the podcast I had with him as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really entertaining.</v>

2789
01:50:12.641 --> 01:50:13.540
<v Speaker 2>If you ever want to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

2791
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>

2792
01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:16.533
<v Speaker 2>I'm like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a few of his cartoons clipped out </v>

2793
01:50:18.041 --> 01:50:21.420
<v Speaker 2>and stuck up on my cubicle online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a cubicle.</v>

<v Speaker 2>she could rollerblade in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>security so locked down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that guy who was the sign </v>

2820
01:51:26.681 --> 01:51:27.514
<v Speaker 2>language interpreter for Obama.</v>

2821
01:51:30.251 --> 01:51:31.084
<v Speaker 2>psychopath who didn't know sign language</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all and he was up there just making </v>

2822
01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:36.813
<v Speaker 2>fucking signs and shut tastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy was standing three feet </v>

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.793
<v Speaker 4>There've been a few security screw ups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a little while back before </v>

2827
01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 4>that incident that you're talking about </v>

<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

2835
01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 4>not great in the sense that it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a fuck up,</v>

2836
01:52:04.121 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time it was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2837
01:52:06.341 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2843
01:52:17.741 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 4>and this one fellow went to get on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>elevator and who does that?</v>

2844
01:52:21.131 --> 01:52:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Who even thinks that the presenter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to keep the door open.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I got to get on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to Texas,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And so it gets on the secret service.</v>

2848
01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:33.700
<v Speaker 4>Asked him to leave obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2849
01:52:33.701 --> 01:52:34.990
<v Speaker 4>he shouldn't have been on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have had,</v>

2850
01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:35.853
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of guys standing outside the </v>

2851
01:52:36.491 --> 01:52:38.140
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked him to leave.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he won't leave.</v>

2853
01:52:39.071 --> 01:52:42.190
<v Speaker 4>They rides up basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then as it turns out,</v>

2854
01:52:42.191 --> 01:52:44.370
<v Speaker 4>he's armed and he's a guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2855
01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:47.740
<v Speaker 4>He said private security guard for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>facility on,</v>

2856
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 4>under contract with a company that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>the contract for security.</v>

2857
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.280
<v Speaker 4>It was armed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even know it.</v>

2858
01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.360
<v Speaker 4>So server that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No idea.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's in the elevator three feet away </v>

2861
01:52:57.971 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 3>from the process.</v>

2862
01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>

2863
01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:00.723
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there've been little situations like </v>

2864
01:53:02.741 --> 01:53:04.030
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tough,</v>

2865
01:53:04.031 --> 01:53:05.160
<v Speaker 4>tough job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2866
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:08.020
<v Speaker 4>that secret service operation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2867
01:53:08.021 --> 01:53:08.854
<v Speaker 4>it seems like it only makes the news </v>
<v Speaker 4>when there's some bad thing that </v>

2868
01:53:11.111 --> 01:53:13.960
<v Speaker 4>happened to fuck up or something.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's a tough ass job.</v>

2872
01:53:18.490 --> 01:53:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only imagine.</v>

2873
01:53:19.570 --> 01:53:23.770
<v Speaker 3>And we should applaud them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How few of those fuck ups ever had.</v>

2874
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:24.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2877
01:53:26.731 --> 01:53:27.531
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2878
01:53:27.531 --> 01:53:30.110
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a thankless job in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in many,</v>

2879
01:53:30.111 --> 01:53:31.930
<v Speaker 4>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2880
01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:35.870
<v Speaker 4>it's just really a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always high stress.</v>

2881
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:38.450
<v Speaker 4>It's always stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>

2882
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:38.651
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2883
01:53:38.651 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 4>I give those folks a lot of credit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like the FBI,</v>

2884
01:53:40.461 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 4>FBI has staff with brilliant people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great people.</v>

2885
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.823
<v Speaker 3>Which just imagine this woman who made </v>
<v Speaker 3>this facebook post about not being </v>

2886
01:53:46.321 --> 01:53:47.820
<v Speaker 3>willing to take a bullet for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

2887
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.160
<v Speaker 3>What if she said that about the CEO of </v>
<v Speaker 3>allstate?</v>

2888
01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like a good move.</v>

2889
01:53:52.050 --> 01:53:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't take a bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how crazy the job is.</v>

2890
01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:55.643
<v Speaker 3>That there is a consideration that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>might one day have to take a bullet for </v>

2891
01:53:59.041 --> 01:53:59.874
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2892
01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:02.160
<v Speaker 3>And apparently she wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2893
01:54:02.610 --> 01:54:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2894
01:54:03.930 --> 01:54:04.763
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she was just angry and maybe she </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do her job because she's a </v>

2895
01:54:07.441 --> 01:54:07.990
<v Speaker 3>patriot.</v>

2896
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully.</v>

2897
01:54:08.771 --> 01:54:09.604
<v Speaker 4>So that would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think she's gonna at least be on </v>

2898
01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:14.020
<v Speaker 4>ice for a while based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2899
01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:14.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2900
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:15.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2901
01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.713
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2902
01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:20.650
<v Speaker 4>and that's true of any executive </v>
<v Speaker 4>protection detail.</v>

2903
01:54:20.710 --> 01:54:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously it's,</v>

2904
01:54:21.570 --> 01:54:25.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a heightened situation when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the president or you know,</v>

2905
01:54:25.081 --> 01:54:26.350
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dignitaries or whatever,</v>

2906
01:54:26.351 --> 01:54:29.530
<v Speaker 4>but anybody in that business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no room for ego.</v>

2907
01:54:29.531 --> 01:54:30.364
<v Speaker 4>Can't have an ego if your body guards to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make people think about bodyguards and </v>

2908
01:54:33.101 --> 01:54:35.010
<v Speaker 4>they tend to think about somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2909
01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:36.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>protecting,</v>

2910
01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:38.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kardashians or something,</v>

2911
01:54:38.081 --> 01:54:40.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a celebrity bodyguard,</v>

2912
01:54:40.450 --> 01:54:45.450
<v Speaker 4>but the executive protection world is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly large business and you know,</v>

2913
01:54:47.170 --> 01:54:48.010
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2914
01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:52.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a really tough industry and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>no room for egos and it's a,</v>

2915
01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:56.230
<v Speaker 4>requires a real variety of skills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diplomacy,</v>

2916
01:54:56.231 --> 01:54:59.200
<v Speaker 4>common sense on top of all the typical </v>
<v Speaker 4>skills you would imagine.</v>

2917
01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:01.660
<v Speaker 4>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2918
01:55:01.661 --> 01:55:04.000
<v Speaker 4>it's just a sort of a thankless job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2919
01:55:04.001 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 4>you're often dealing with principals who</v>
<v Speaker 4>really don't even want you there.</v>

2920
01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:10.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high net wealth families.</v>

2921
01:55:10.061 --> 01:55:13.590
<v Speaker 4>I net wealth individuals and they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed a tolerant.</v>

2922
01:55:13.690 --> 01:55:16.060
<v Speaker 4>They tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't really want you there and,</v>

2923
01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:16.890
<v Speaker 4>or they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2924
01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:19.330
<v Speaker 4>they think you're after awhile you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just there to carry bags.</v>

2925
01:55:19.331 --> 01:55:21.430
<v Speaker 4>And so the folks that do those jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2926
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:23.950
<v Speaker 4>in serious details,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really tough.</v>

2927
01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.720
<v Speaker 4>And then like out out in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2928
01:55:25.721 --> 01:55:27.070
<v Speaker 4>you sometimes get down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2929
01:55:27.071 --> 01:55:28.000
<v Speaker 4>the bodyguard is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2930
01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:28.853
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all hire whoever happens to be </v>

2931
01:55:29.711 --> 01:55:31.100
<v Speaker 4>biggest and that's the worst thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2932
01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:31.841
<v Speaker 4>you don't want it some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2933
01:55:31.841 --> 01:55:32.674
<v Speaker 4>some big thick neck guy out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking that he's going to protect you </v>

2934
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:39.390
<v Speaker 4>and that he's the best guy when it could</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact be the five foot two woman who's</v>

2935
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:42.530
<v Speaker 4>going to be actually the smartest </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she's got all the right skills.</v>

2936
01:55:42.531 --> 01:55:44.350
<v Speaker 4>She's got the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2937
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.950
<v Speaker 4>and if you've got something busted up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the principal,</v>

2938
01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.210
<v Speaker 4>you've already fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2939
01:55:48.211 --> 01:55:49.800
<v Speaker 4>You've already missed the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2940
01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to sort the problem out.</v>

2941
01:55:51.541 --> 01:55:51.840
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2942
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.673
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's better with a physically </v>

2943
01:55:53.431 --> 01:55:56.130
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable person because they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>steps to make sure that it never gets to</v>

2944
01:55:56.131 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 3>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the big guy thinks he can handle</v>

2945
01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.800
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always looks to handle it or,</v>

2946
01:55:59.801 --> 01:56:00.371
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2947
01:56:00.371 --> 01:56:01.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2948
01:56:01.001 --> 01:56:02.110
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2949
01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.033
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much are we are we veered off into </v>

2950
01:56:04.181 --> 01:56:05.080
<v Speaker 4>that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a,</v>

2951
01:56:05.081 --> 01:56:06.790
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2952
01:56:06.791 --> 01:56:07.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2953
01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:10.540
<v Speaker 4>it's again heightened when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the president.</v>

2954
01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so beyond.</v>

2955
01:56:13.130 --> 01:56:13.963
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2956
01:56:14.610 --> 01:56:16.150
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about</v>

2957
01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:17.411
<v Speaker 3>w w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

2958
01:56:17.411 --> 01:56:18.244
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we should we be concerned about </v>

2959
01:56:20.291 --> 01:56:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Putin and Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2960
01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:24.040
<v Speaker 3>is that something we need to go back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I grew up?</v>

2961
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I are pretty much the same age </v>

2962
01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:28.630
<v Speaker 3>when we're in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember that fear,</v>

2963
01:56:28.631 --> 01:56:29.464
<v Speaker 3>like everybody had this fear hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>over our head that we were going to go </v>

2964
01:56:30.881 --> 01:56:33.700
<v Speaker 3>to war with Russia is going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mutually assured destruction.</v>

2965
01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing we could do.</v>

2966
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:36.953
<v Speaker 3>I used to go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they think about that when I </v>

2967
01:56:38.351 --> 01:56:39.520
<v Speaker 3>was like 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

2968
01:56:39.521 --> 01:56:42.010
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to die in a nuclear bomb.</v>

2969
01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:42.801
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2970
01:56:42.801 --> 01:56:44.420
<v Speaker 4>I 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2971
01:56:44.421 --> 01:56:46.930
<v Speaker 4>I remember when in elementary school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2972
01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:48.593
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd have a duck and cover under your </v>

2973
01:56:50.541 --> 01:56:52.010
<v Speaker 4>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck with all that.</v>

2974
01:56:52.011 --> 01:56:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I remember one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my friends,</v>

2975
01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:56.810
<v Speaker 4>once I was sitting under the desk and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mark said,</v>

2976
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.883
<v Speaker 4>we started talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked at him and I had older </v>

2977
01:56:59.181 --> 01:56:59.691
<v Speaker 4>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2978
01:56:59.691 --> 01:57:02.060
<v Speaker 4>so they'd already told me that help </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit that exercise was.</v>

2979
01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.073
<v Speaker 4>But I realized that my friend Mark Air </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there as we kind of ate our </v>

2980
01:57:05.331 --> 01:57:06.164
<v Speaker 4>lunch underneath a desk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what seemed like this was going to do </v>

2981
01:57:08.511 --> 01:57:09.620
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was going to protect us.</v>

2982
01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:11.600
<v Speaker 4>And I remember looking at him and I told</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2983
01:57:11.601 --> 01:57:12.020
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mark,</v>

2984
01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:13.520
<v Speaker 4>this is not going to stop a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 4>bomb.</v>

2985
01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.920
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that thing's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>just blow the shit out of us.</v>

2986
01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:17.330
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

2987
01:57:18.170 --> 01:57:20.990
<v Speaker 4>I think I ruined the kid for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for life.</v>

2988
01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.553
<v Speaker 4>But he got to work in the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this poor dudes still shaken into </v>

2989
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:28.540
<v Speaker 4>God to protect their duties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2990
01:57:28.670 --> 01:57:29.820
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2991
01:57:30.250 --> 01:57:31.083
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we should be worried about </v>

2992
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:35.420
<v Speaker 4>puente in the sense that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his agenda,</v>

2993
01:57:35.421 --> 01:57:38.220
<v Speaker 4>his interest don't match up with ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2994
01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.313
<v Speaker 4>we should be worried in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he honestly believes that the biggest </v>

2995
01:57:42.441 --> 01:57:44.960
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe was the collapse of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union.</v>

2996
01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's never believed.</v>

2997
01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:51.980
<v Speaker 4>He's never believed that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>peace dividend from the,</v>

2998
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.480
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the end of the Cold War.</v>

2999
01:57:53.630 --> 01:57:55.220
<v Speaker 4>Never ever thought that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we did.</v>

3000
01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:58.910
<v Speaker 4>And there was talk about up on capital </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill after the end of the Cold War,</v>

3001
01:57:58.970 --> 01:58:02.360
<v Speaker 4>that fall of the Berlin Wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could shut down the CIA,</v>

3002
01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:03.253
<v Speaker 4>what do we need that for anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was a same thought that </v>

3003
01:58:05.061 --> 01:58:05.894
<v Speaker 4>happened after World War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>World War Two ended and Harry Truman </v>

3004
01:58:09.110 --> 01:58:11.240
<v Speaker 4>signed an order that ended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3005
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:14.960
<v Speaker 4>the office of strategic services,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the precursor for the CIA,</v>

3006
01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.500
<v Speaker 4>shut it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took two years,</v>

3007
01:58:18.710 --> 01:58:21.380
<v Speaker 4>two years while the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Soviet Union started building up and</v>

3008
01:58:21.381 --> 01:58:24.200
<v Speaker 4>rampaging for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3009
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:26.990
<v Speaker 4>the president of thank you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is actually a good idea.</v>

3010
01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:29.120
<v Speaker 4>So then he created the CIA at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

3011
01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:30.073
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3012
01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:32.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3013
01:58:32.590 --> 01:58:33.423
<v Speaker 4>we thought we were going to get some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of dividend out of the end of that </v>

3014
01:58:35.590 --> 01:58:36.423
<v Speaker 4>and it just wasn't gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Russians never ever believed that </v>

3015
01:58:38.691 --> 01:58:39.524
<v Speaker 4>Putin and particular in his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his cohorts never thought that was the </v>

3016
01:58:41.201 --> 01:58:42.011
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

3017
01:58:42.011 --> 01:58:44.620
<v Speaker 4>we should be concerned about Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to ever be,</v>

3018
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:46.300
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be a bipolar world </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

3019
01:58:46.301 --> 01:58:50.070
<v Speaker 4>where there the other major superpower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

3020
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.830
<v Speaker 4>in the sense that we need to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>him realistically,</v>

3021
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:56.500
<v Speaker 4>we should always talk fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do a diplomacy,</v>

3022
01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:58.660
<v Speaker 4>but we just need to be pragmatic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

3023
01:58:58.661 --> 01:58:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to.</v>

3024
01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:00.153
<v Speaker 4>Our interests aren't the same and if as </v>
<v Speaker 4>long as we keep that in mind as sure I </v>

3025
01:59:04.211 --> 01:59:05.120
<v Speaker 4>talk all we want to them.</v>

3026
01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

3027
01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.820
<v Speaker 3>He's a physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did by,</v>

3028
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:10.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running Russia,</v>

3029
01:59:10.321 --> 01:59:11.154
<v Speaker 3>stepping back and being sort of a puppet</v>
<v Speaker 3>master for awhile and then jumping back </v>

3030
01:59:14.431 --> 01:59:16.710
<v Speaker 3>in 2012 and running it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3031
01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3032
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:20.183
<v Speaker 3>that's the type of behavior that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are terrified of when someone is just </v>

3033
01:59:24.301 --> 01:59:28.650
<v Speaker 3>sort of a blatant dictator but masked as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a democracy.</v>

3034
01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3035
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.530
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't even really try the masking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore.</v>

3036
01:59:32.010 --> 01:59:34.850
<v Speaker 3>After 2012 we just kind of ramped it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3037
01:59:35.590 --> 01:59:35.920
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

3038
01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:36.753
<v Speaker 4>he's done in part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I what I said that he thinks it was </v>

3039
01:59:39.371 --> 01:59:40.500
<v Speaker 4>a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3040
01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:41.373
<v Speaker 4>those are his words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought he said the collapse of the </v>

3041
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union was the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of the 20th century and he's</v>

3042
01:59:47.921 --> 01:59:48.754
<v Speaker 4>absolutely serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's been trying to rebuild that in </v>

3043
01:59:50.921 --> 01:59:54.500
<v Speaker 4>some fashion or another ever since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just territory,</v>

3044
01:59:54.501 --> 01:59:55.990
<v Speaker 4>although he's done a pretty good job of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3045
01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we forget that before Crimea,</v>

3046
01:59:59.090 --> 02:00:00.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3047
02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.150
<v Speaker 4>he rolled troops into Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3048
02:00:02.170 --> 02:00:02.560
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3049
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.700
<v Speaker 4>not the state of Georgia Thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

3050
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:06.850
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't make sense.</v>

3051
02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:09.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Mike knows what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

3052
02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:09.993
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3053
02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.460
<v Speaker 4>but in Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Republic of Georgia,</v>

3054
02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:15.040
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be damned,</v>

3055
02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:18.040
<v Speaker 4>but he's still got troops there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a lot of troops are and it's in</v>

3056
02:00:18.041 --> 02:00:20.200
<v Speaker 4>a upc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kazia and south assess you.</v>

3057
02:00:20.650 --> 02:00:24.380
<v Speaker 4>And then he's also obviously took Crimea</v>
<v Speaker 4>and why to take Crimea.</v>

3058
02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's important to his fleet.</v>

3059
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:29.170
<v Speaker 4>It's not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not gonna happen.</v>

3060
02:00:29.171 --> 02:00:31.330
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to risk losing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

3061
02:00:31.331 --> 02:00:33.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the Ukraine and,</v>

3062
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:35.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just territory that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in.</v>

3063
02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:37.240
<v Speaker 4>It's leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its influence.</v>

3064
02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.133
<v Speaker 4>And that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we go back to that conversation </v>

3065
02:00:39.101 --> 02:00:39.934
<v Speaker 4>about the Middle East and we realized </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they'd been doing in the Middle </v>

3066
02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:44.440
<v Speaker 4>East in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been active in other places,</v>

3067
02:00:44.441 --> 02:00:45.980
<v Speaker 4>but mostly in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3068
02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:50.660
<v Speaker 4>that's all part of this same process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and it's so,</v>

3069
02:00:50.661 --> 02:00:53.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not a mystery why he does things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's if you,</v>

3070
02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:58.860
<v Speaker 4>if you take him at his base word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we should do because he's,</v>

3071
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:00.183
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tends to say exactly what he intends </v>

3072
02:01:01.361 --> 02:01:03.470
<v Speaker 4>to do most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3073
02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:06.430
<v Speaker 4>and not try to read our values into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3074
02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:06.941
<v Speaker 4>Not Say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3075
02:01:06.941 --> 02:01:08.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he doesn't mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure what he means is like,</v>

3076
02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:09.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

3077
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:11.620
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants to get to democracy eventually,</v>

3078
02:01:11.621 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 4>but that's a lot of horseshit.</v>

3079
02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:15.430
<v Speaker 4>But we tend to mirror our values on </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

3080
02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:16.293
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when we were talking about earlier </v>

3081
02:01:17.861 --> 02:01:18.940
<v Speaker 4>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3082
02:01:18.941 --> 02:01:19.774
<v Speaker 4>there's not another nation out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that really kind of approaches global </v>

3083
02:01:21.821 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 4>concerns a way that we do with certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>set of principles and,</v>

3084
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:26.200
<v Speaker 4>and desires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if we make mistakes.</v>

3085
02:01:26.201 --> 02:01:28.030
<v Speaker 4>And obviously we do from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

3086
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:30.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

3087
02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:31.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at,</v>

3088
02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.150
<v Speaker 4>you look at Russia and you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3089
02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't do that.</v>

3090
02:01:35.681 --> 02:01:37.640
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't look at something and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

3091
02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:38.643
<v Speaker 4>maybe that would be best for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's ever had that </v>

3092
02:01:41.751 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3093
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:43.574
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he literally is single minded in his </v>

3094
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:48.830
<v Speaker 4>desire to do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll build back up Russian influence in</v>

3095
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:49.664
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have to be pragmatic about it and </v>

3096
02:01:51.051 --> 02:01:51.540
<v Speaker 4>dealing with them</v>

3097
02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.490
<v Speaker 3>and to get a better understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

3098
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3099
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:55.304
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great podcast between Sam </v>

3100
02:01:56.850 --> 02:01:57.683
<v Speaker 3>Harris and Gary Kasparov,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chess champion who was a big critic </v>

3101
02:02:01.231 --> 02:02:04.590
<v Speaker 3>of Putin has managed to stay alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another q and a,</v>

3102
02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:05.483
<v Speaker 3>I guess because he's just so famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was a thing with one of his </v>

3103
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:10.103
<v Speaker 3>political opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought that if he was public he </v>

3104
02:02:12.961 --> 02:02:13.794
<v Speaker 3>would be much less likely to be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they shot him right in front of his </v>

3105
02:02:16.441 --> 02:02:17.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking girlfriend and public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3106
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3107
02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There've been a number of incidences,</v>

3108
02:02:21.841 --> 02:02:23.220
<v Speaker 3>bunch bunch of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3109
02:02:23.221 --> 02:02:24.054
<v Speaker 3>he's a on a totally different level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Kasparov highlights the fact that </v>

3110
02:02:27.451 --> 02:02:28.284
<v Speaker 3>he's a former kgb agent and says like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand the mentality of </v>

3111
02:02:31.861 --> 02:02:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the KGB,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like once you are kgb,</v>

3112
02:02:34.561 --> 02:02:36.540
<v Speaker 3>your kgb for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3113
02:02:36.541 --> 02:02:40.590
<v Speaker 3>it was an extreme form of nationalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and patriotism and this,</v>

3114
02:02:40.591 --> 02:02:44.100
<v Speaker 3>this loyalty to the KGB that.</v>

3115
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:45.021
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

3116
02:02:45.021 --> 02:02:46.540
<v Speaker 4>He's eight and he's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

3117
02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:48.620
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

3118
02:02:48.621 --> 02:02:50.060
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do this thing where we,</v>

3119
02:02:50.650 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's basically called mirroring,</v>

3120
02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like I,</v>

3121
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:56.150
<v Speaker 4>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we and we,</v>

3122
02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:57.073
<v Speaker 4>and then we get tripped up and we think </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could look at Iraq and Afghanistan </v>

3123
02:02:59.361 --> 02:03:01.040
<v Speaker 4>as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course they're going to love this.</v>

3124
02:03:01.190 --> 02:03:03.650
<v Speaker 4>You gotTa love democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because we love it,</v>

3125
02:03:03.930 --> 02:03:04.763
<v Speaker 4>we want to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to improve their literacy rate </v>

3126
02:03:06.381 --> 02:03:09.230
<v Speaker 4>and we want to do these things well </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all great stuff,</v>

3127
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:12.920
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't work in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not how they view things.</v>

3128
02:03:13.190 --> 02:03:13.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>

3129
02:03:13.821 --> 02:03:14.654
<v Speaker 4>I looked at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a shitload of money that I'm </v>

3130
02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 4>gonna be able to steal here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cars I family was completely corrupt and</v>

3131
02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:23.600
<v Speaker 4>remember there was that period of time </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we just adored him.</v>

3132
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:24.740
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was adulation.</v>

3133
02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:25.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

3134
02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.600
<v Speaker 4>how wonderful his cars I look out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3135
02:03:26.601 --> 02:03:29.000
<v Speaker 4>he dresses and that was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell?</v>

3136
02:03:29.150 --> 02:03:31.460
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Putin,</v>

3137
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:35.180
<v Speaker 4>I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not in a sense that we've got some world</v>

3138
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:38.180
<v Speaker 4>war three coming up against Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the case.</v>

3139
02:03:38.181 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 4>That's not why we should be concerned </v>
<v Speaker 4>about them.</v>

3140
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:41.780
<v Speaker 4>Although you do have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3141
02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:44.840
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worry about military buildup,</v>

3142
02:03:44.841 --> 02:03:46.360
<v Speaker 4>worry about their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3143
02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 4>a nuke program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3144
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:48.974
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what they're doing with their ears </v>

3145
02:03:49.570 --> 02:03:53.260
<v Speaker 4>and what we're doing with ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A unilateral disarmament.</v>

3146
02:03:53.290 --> 02:03:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3147
02:03:54.661 --> 02:03:56.420
<v Speaker 4>whether we're talking about Putin or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else,</v>

3148
02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can always want peace and you can </v>

3149
02:03:59.061 --> 02:03:59.894
<v Speaker 4>strive for peace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I have not seen a world that works </v>

3150
02:04:03.291 --> 02:04:05.840
<v Speaker 4>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to do that through a position</v>

3151
02:04:05.841 --> 02:04:06.674
<v Speaker 4>of strength.</v>

3152
02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:07.873
<v Speaker 3>I think these conversations are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>important because when a guy like you </v>

3153
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.863
<v Speaker 3>talks about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking out of your ass and </v>

3154
02:04:13.851 --> 02:04:14.684
<v Speaker 3>you get a chance to understand how crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation is worldwide and how </v>

3155
02:04:19.161 --> 02:04:21.800
<v Speaker 3>difficult it is and what a balancing act</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

3156
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3157
02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:23.090
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3158
02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's tough.</v>

3159
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:28.670
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want to be like the head of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the State Department.</v>

3160
02:04:28.671 --> 02:04:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean the chief diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a tough ass job.</v>

3161
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:32.183
<v Speaker 4>You don't get any sleep now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to do it and you got to </v>

3162
02:04:34.131 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 4>keep that level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like fighting terrorism.</v>

3163
02:04:35.871 --> 02:04:36.704
<v Speaker 4>It's like fighting Islamic state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got do it on several different </v>

3164
02:04:37.891 --> 02:04:40.270
<v Speaker 4>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Community outreach and you know,</v>

3165
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:43.380
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to solve problems here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it militarily.</v>

3166
02:04:43.381 --> 02:04:44.214
<v Speaker 4>All these things have to work together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we got to be smart enough to do </v>

3167
02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:46.990
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the same thing with,</v>

3168
02:04:46.991 --> 02:04:48.180
<v Speaker 4>with dealing with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3169
02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the narrative that somehow trump was</v>

3170
02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:55.170
<v Speaker 4>being played by Putin was his best </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend was until I don't,</v>

3171
02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:56.033
<v Speaker 4>I'm not buying any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we'll find is you need to </v>

3172
02:04:57.841 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 4>watch more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keith overman video.</v>

3173

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:04:59.670 --> 02:05:00.061

3177
02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we're going to find is,</v>

3178
02:05:07.231 --> 02:05:08.064
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3179
02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:11.550
<v Speaker 4>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what trump probably I think maybe again,</v>

3180

<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe please pop it.</v>

3181
02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what,</v>

3182
02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:17.500
<v Speaker 4>what he's thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3183
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.353
<v Speaker 4>what we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an example of the military will get </v>

3184
02:05:19.831 --> 02:05:21.150
<v Speaker 4>to build up the military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3185
02:05:21.151 --> 02:05:22.470
<v Speaker 4>he knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3186
02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:25.010
<v Speaker 4>he's smart enough to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3187
02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 4>we got that a wall to fall because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>outspent the hell out of the Russians.</v>

3188
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.270
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

3189
02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:31.253
<v Speaker 4>and also part of it was Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually didn't know if Reagan was </v>

3190
02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 4>crazy enough to hit the button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3191
02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:38.760
<v Speaker 4>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unknowing,</v>

3192
02:05:38.761 --> 02:05:39.594
<v Speaker 4>that uncertainty about what Reagan was </v>
<v Speaker 4>all about combined with the fact that </v>

3193
02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:44.250
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were outspending them,</v>

3194
02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:46.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they couldn't keep up.</v>

3195
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:50.850
<v Speaker 4>That's what brought the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually to realize,</v>

3196
02:05:50.851 --> 02:05:51.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

3197
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:53.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got to realign things because this</v>

3198
02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:53.980
<v Speaker 4>isn't going to work.</v>

3199
02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:54.813
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they found out that Nancy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan based all of our decisions and </v>

02:06:56.381 --> 02:06:57.220
<v Speaker 4>but this is a trump</v>

3223
02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:59.730
<v Speaker 2>trump signs order to bar some refugees </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling.</v>

3224
02:06:59.731 --> 02:07:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Prioritizing Syrian Christians letting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syrian Christians through.</v>

3225
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3226
02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Have a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that they're going to be</v>

3227
02:07:08.851 --> 02:07:09.684
<v Speaker 2>fucking Syrian Christian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know they're really </v>

3228
02:07:10.891 --> 02:07:11.724
<v Speaker 2>Christian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have priority probably </v>

3229
02:07:13.111 --> 02:07:14.520
<v Speaker 2>be wearing a cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3230
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:16.220
<v Speaker 2>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3231
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:17.203
<v Speaker 2>That sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Identifying specific countries with </v>

3232
02:07:20.221 --> 02:07:21.054
<v Speaker 2>Muslim majorities and carving out </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptions for minority religions flies </v>

3233
02:07:23.701 --> 02:07:24.534
<v Speaker 2>in the face of the constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle that bands of government from </v>

3234
02:07:26.401 --> 02:07:30.480
<v Speaker 2>either favoring or discriminating </v>
<v Speaker 2>against particular religions.</v>

3235
02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Ramiro said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the trump card.</v>

3236
02:07:32.371 --> 02:07:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a Muslim,</v>

3237
02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:36.760
<v Speaker 2>you could come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were a Christian,</v>

3238
02:07:36.761 --> 02:07:41.200
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was so unfair,</v>

3239
02:07:41.410 --> 02:07:43.660
<v Speaker 2>everybody was persecuted in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairness,</v>

3240
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>but they were chopping off the heads of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

3241
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>but more so the Christian tell is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the president.</v>

3242
02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:49.900
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

3243
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 2>You know I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's a run on sentence.</v>

3244
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.073
<v Speaker 2>Might be a little bit of a run on trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>said in an excerpt of an interview with </v>

3245
02:07:55.991 --> 02:07:57.610
<v Speaker 2>the Christian Broadcasting Network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3251
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Diet coke gave Tammy Faye brain cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she died.</v>

3252
02:08:15.611 --> 02:08:18.340
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's strict jugs of diet coke every day</v>
