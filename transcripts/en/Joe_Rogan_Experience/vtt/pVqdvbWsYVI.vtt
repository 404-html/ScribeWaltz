1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.080
<v Speaker 1>when so many people are dead or driven</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

3
00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her entire life is about fear and it's</v>

4
00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it dictates everything that they do</v>

5
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>versus following your gut and putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear aside and once you do it makes</v>

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>all the difference in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Fears good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a motivating factor.</v>

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also the lack of fear can be</v>

9
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

10
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I always say like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are not scared when they're</v>

11
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those two people are in trouble.</v>

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.571
<v Speaker 1>You're in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

13
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you should be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes to be scared,</v>

14
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>but when I was competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst tournament's that I ever</v>

15
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>fought in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not nervous.</v>

16
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It was too confident and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>performed poorly.</v>

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>But when I was fucking terrified and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like completely on edge,</v>

18
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>then your body's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just primal.</v>

19
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you get down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bare minimum amount of</v>

20
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do of the thinking of</v>

21
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:55.691
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

22
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world fades away and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about is that task.</v>

23
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>You cutting out everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no thought about bills.</v>

24
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>There's no thought about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just what's going on in front of</v>

25
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get down to that,</v>

26
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>that's when you perform at your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's fucking terrifying.</v>

27
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>So nobody likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes to be like,</v>

28
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>when you see guys that are in like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC that are like,</v>

29
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>like here's a good example and I'm a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan of Luke rockhold.</v>

30
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about on the way</v>

31
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was way too relaxed.</v>

32
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Thought he was going to kill Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisping.</v>

33
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Michael bisping fought that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going in against a fucking silver</v>

34
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>back gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified or not terrified,</v>

35
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked up with nerves and like you</v>

36
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>always on the line for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>That's how you walked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knocked him out.</v>

38
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Such a great sport because first knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>out too in the UFC,</v>

39
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just first Kao like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you sell them on the way to</v>

40
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Jorge Rivera in Manchester and beat down</v>
<v Speaker 1>may him Miller is a Tko but the Tkos.</v>

41
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's also sitting down and its</v>

42
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>punches better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason Parillo,</v>

43
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>his boxing coach has really been working</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him and done a fantastic job with</v>

44
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>him and with Cris Cyborg and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that the buildup to that</v>

45
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>reminded me of Keith Jardeen talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Houston Alexander.</v>

46
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking like,</v>

47
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really dismissive,</v>

48
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>like cannot even in my league and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff and all of a sudden you're</v>

49
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:17.770
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

50
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

51
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>When a guy's a professional fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just stood there and let him</v>

52
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>punch you in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it knock you out?</v>

53
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:24.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

54
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that it can fucking happen.</v>

55
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They kind of lose a bit of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing you want to be is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that says,</v>

57
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>this guy can't beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go in there and fuck them</v>

58
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you wake up with a flashlight</v>

59
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>in your eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

64
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ego that allow the ego tells you</v>

65
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>that it's gonna protect you from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't even have to worry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can hear like someone saying,</v>

120
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>his hands broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Oh,</v>

122
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>this is what you gotta do that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't,</v>

124
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you just get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get insight.</v>

125
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>And you also get a sense of a building</v>
<v Speaker 1>up anticipation.</v>

126
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Like if you know that a guy's got an</v>
<v Speaker 1>injury and then he's trying to gut it</v>

127
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it even more exciting to watch.</v>

128
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.961
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

129
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome sport.</v>

130
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only got a couple of hobbies watching</v>

131
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

132
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.701
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're,</v>

133
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

134
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>they're very comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like know from going from being a</v>

135
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:46.831
<v Speaker 1>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.411
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

137
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exciting.</v>

138
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>It's slow portions of nothing in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and grinding and all of a</v>

139
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then every now and again you get a</v>

140
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>step in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

141
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see where you're at.</v>

142
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

143
00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

144
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you always say like two guys.</v>

145
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stripped down to the gets.</v>

146
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>You either win or lose at 50 50 I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>either going to win or I'm not.</v>

147
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And same with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at at certain point in time and</v>

148
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you either either get them or you don't</v>

149
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.500
<v Speaker 1>like the percentages work out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

150
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the cool thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think also like hunting,</v>

151
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not perceived correctly by a lot of</v>

152
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very misunderstood and a lot of</v>

153
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>people think of it as this barbaric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful thing involving bullies and</v>

154
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>assholes when really they're incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

155
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>difficult people were pursuing one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

156
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the most difficult things to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with dire physical consequences.</v>

157
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>If you fail those bullies and assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the dedication that get</v>

158
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

159
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't the real guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't have the understanding</v>

160
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>of who they actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The T in order to face your own fears,</v>

161
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the bullies and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes,</v>

162
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>like you can get a certain distance with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

163
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>with physical power and genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>

164
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Make some guys just hit fucking hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just good at taking a shot.</v>

165
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you stand in front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whale with them,</v>

166
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>they might catch you and knock you out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beat your ass.</v>

167
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>And you just got beat by a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is when those guys get</v>

168
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>to a steep emile chick or Cain Velasquez</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

169
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.530

170
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.080

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Because those guys are just as just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically strong,</v>

172
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>just as kate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also have their mental shit in</v>

<v Speaker 1>And those guys are some of the nicest,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to meet because they get their ego</v>
