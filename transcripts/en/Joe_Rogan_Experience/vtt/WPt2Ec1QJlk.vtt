1
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we really live.</v>

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if it works.</v>

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the Internet here sucks.</v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you are,</v>

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but you're also on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hold on.</v>

6
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to miss for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on folks.</v>

7
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to log in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the little spout,</v>

8
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>these waters anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the longest,</v>

10
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>most unprofessional pause in the history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my podcast career,</v>

11
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but I had to do it because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's running the mic here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're making sure that everything is </v>

13
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we're live and online.</v>

14
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>This episode of Joe Rogan Experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>Podcast is brought to you by </v>

15
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.690
<v Speaker 1>audible.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>if you've never been to audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have thousands and thousands of </v>

17
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>audio books available for download and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have one thing that's really cool.</v>

18
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:32.071
<v Speaker 1>It's a whisper sync,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a application for the kindle fire hd.</v>

19
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>And what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way it works,</v>

20
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>you're reading a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you stopped on page 32 and you go to</v>

21
00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:42.721
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get up in the morning and </v>

22
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:42.721
<v Speaker 1>get in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it syncs up to your cell phone.</v>

23
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So it automatically starts an audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the book right where you left</v>

24
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea.</v>

25
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.640
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you say that one more time?</v>

26
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>There's Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn.</v>

27
00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>My pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an application called whisper </v>

28
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>sync for in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it works is when you,</v>

29
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have one of those Amazon kindle hds,</v>

30
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you those bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Then you can use this when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a book on it.</v>

32
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

33
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>if it has a companion audio book with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whisper singing allows you to sync </v>

34
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 1>it up to your smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a smartphone,</v>

35
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 1>iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you have syncs it up.</v>

36
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So then when you get in the car it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts playing audio companion to the </v>

37
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>book you're reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

38
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read by a professional actor.</v>

39
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to two competing versions </v>

40
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 2>though because listening to books a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit different than reading it.</v>

41
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 2>So you'd be getting parts that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to parts that you read?</v>

42
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be good unless the guy sucks at </v>

44
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 1>reading books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you ever read A.</v>

45
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

46
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would love it man.</v>

47
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 2>You burned through way more books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

48
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:55.571
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to start a new </v>

49
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:56.851
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you just want to keep doing </v>

50
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:56.851
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing</v>

51
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:56.851
<v Speaker 1>and it makes use of time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

52
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I listen books all the time.</v>

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those elliptical </v>

54
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.130
<v Speaker 1>riders,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love audio books,</v>

63
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.520

<v Speaker 1>tie in together.</v>

64
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a brilliant idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of stuff done today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have the Golden Globes on tape.</v>

83
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.690

00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:10.581
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

119
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I would like to eat that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve,</v>

120
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 3>how could you forget our bear meat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You smoked bear meat.</v>

121
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm telling you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife had,</v>

122
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 3>we have a baby that we had a baby a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month ago and like I said,</v>

123
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 3>I've been sleeping on the floor next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bed and asleep bagging all night.</v>

124
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just like I'm like getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrupted and I'm doing and I can't </v>

125
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 3>remember anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And last night at one point I'm like,</v>

126
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I know I'll forget the bear me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should go put the bear meat in my bag </v>

127
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.670
<v Speaker 3>now family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

128
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you started thinking about like </v>

129
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.990
<v Speaker 3>ours without refrigeration and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I'll just get up and to remember</v>

130
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

131
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It's sitting there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good to mad to the sample,</v>

132
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 3>slice off it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it taste like?</v>

133
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Taste like really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

134
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 3>just the way I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like really dense ham,</v>

135
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you sound like a pursued.</v>

136
00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing.</v>

137
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 3>But darker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darker,</v>

138
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know when you say you smoke at </v>

139
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 3>that means you're not cooking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I could get you a hot smoke it.</v>

140
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.240
<v Speaker 3>So I've Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

141
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For about a week.</v>

142
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.270
<v Speaker 3>And then tie it real tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 3>is there a commercial version of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you get like,</v>

144
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's done it,</v>

145
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's done it.</v>

146
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

147
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:22.001
<v Speaker 3>there's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you get wild game in a </v>

148
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:22.001
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's either imported,</v>

149
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 3>like come from Scotland and New Zealand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be deer.</v>

150
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 3>But the domestic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

151
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

152
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the indigenous animals here,</v>

153
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have done wild game versions,</v>

154
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 3>like you can get elk or deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

155
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the bear thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of anybody trying to do</v>

156
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 3>commercially produced bearings of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

157
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 3>So while you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

158
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you can't sell wild game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa,</v>

159
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa have it be inspected and </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced in a controlled environment.</v>

160
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 3>But I think that it would just be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive to put weight on a bear.</v>

161
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 3>How gangster would it be if you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming bears to eat them?</v>

162
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to do it would be illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one time I looked into like </v>

163
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to say I wrote this article about </v>

164
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.630
<v Speaker 3>eating a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our oldest article goodbye.</v>

165
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I went to Vietnam and did a piece about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating dogs around the Tet holiday </v>

166
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.661
<v Speaker 3>because it's like really auspicious to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat a dog in the last days of the lunar </v>

167
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I was reading,</v>

168
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:16.021
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I was writing my article and I had </v>

169
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:16.021
<v Speaker 3>this line in there and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 3>of course it's illegal to sell dog meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the US,</v>

171
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 3>but in other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 3>some line like that and this fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>checkers like,</v>

173
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 3>well how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

174
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 3>show me where you got that.</v>

175
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal to sell dog meat in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

176
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

177
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it is.</v>

178
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 3>You can't sell dog meat in the US is </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

179
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 3>well we need to see something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to have.</v>

180
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.100
<v Speaker 3>You got to back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started looking into it in a real </v>

181
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.480
<v Speaker 3>way and I called someone from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

182
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.620
<v Speaker 3>the Usta and the other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing matters to like </v>

183
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 3>California and New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal to sell dog meat.</v>

184
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like the only two states or someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever really pushed it.</v>

185
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.840
<v Speaker 3>In Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rule is you can't sell dog meat </v>

186
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.400
<v Speaker 3>unless it's property labeled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this guy from the Usta,</v>

187
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.270
<v Speaker 3>now this is a conversation I had with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy from the Usda</v>

188
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and he told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said within their guidelines,</v>

189
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason you could not have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspected dog production facility.</v>

190
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Of course someone's going to come out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the minute you did it,</v>

191
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably have tons of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming after you for different reasons,</v>

192
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing per se that's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>one cannot produce commercially produced</v>

193
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.060
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

194
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.370
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating when we commit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to like being really kind to one </v>

195
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.330
<v Speaker 1>specific animal and that animal</v>

196
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.600
<v Speaker 2>domestic pets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

197
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the three horseplays,</v>

198
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was three horses,</v>

199
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.250
<v Speaker 1>places that all got shut down some years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

200
00:09:27.251 --> 00:09:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're opening one backup.</v>

201
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.310
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is.</v>

202
00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I think if you opened a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.820
<v Speaker 1>dogs are very emotional for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.740
<v Speaker 1>if you do a movie and emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were saying when he did,</v>

205
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie,</v>

206
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.120
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

207
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:46.000
<v Speaker 1>road trip and Jamie Robertson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Junius spits on Zach's dog.</v>

208
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.860
<v Speaker 1>That was a big conversation because how </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get somebody who spits on a dog?</v>

209
00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:53.120
<v Speaker 1>How do you then kind of get them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic?</v>

210
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And this all got an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an awesome tangent.</v>

211
00:09:55.481 --> 00:09:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I got to finish this.</v>

212
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get back around to it.</v>

213
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I want to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about the media man.</v>

216
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.450
<v Speaker 2>his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His dog is.</v>

217
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.460

<v Speaker 2>except the image.</v>

223
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Are you seeing the image?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all I'm seeing is that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because I knew streaming.</v>

235
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.240
<v Speaker 1>See it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure this out.</v>

236
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:22.241
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian has a new kind of aids that he </v>

237
00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:24.080
<v Speaker 1>created himself in his own body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't feel sorry for him.</v>

238
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Not You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about Brian,</v>

239
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 1>my employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

240
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to the poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

241
00:11:28.341 --> 00:11:30.350
<v Speaker 1>He's got got strep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess apparently.</v>

242
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

243
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>he's had it before he gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stress.</v>

244
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

245
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.320
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he loved little buddy.</v>

246
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

247
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.080
<v Speaker 1>he's hurting right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even talk.</v>

248
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.590
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad flu going around,</v>

249
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All over the news.</v>

250
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get a flu shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

251
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I figured you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I remember you telling me </v>

252
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:52.180
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

253
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to keep your immune </v>

254
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 1>system strong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

255
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 1>very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

256
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily know that they've </v>

257
00:11:59.130 --> 00:11:59.130
<v Speaker 5>got that whole flu shot thing down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

258
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of talk that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually get the flu because they take a</v>

259
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:07.201
<v Speaker 5>flu shot of her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People say that because apparently it </v>

260
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:09.301
<v Speaker 5>can make you sick or weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The CDC was saying 64 percent effective </v>

261
00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 5>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sixty four percent.</v>

262
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

263
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about a bunch of mugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They must take bunch of mugs,</v>

264
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.950
<v Speaker 5>give them the flu shot and then spit on </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

265
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:21.050
<v Speaker 5>How a guy with the flu spit on him and </v>
<v Speaker 5>64 percent of those guys didn't get the </v>

266
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.261
<v Speaker 5>flu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm completely talking out of my ass </v>

267
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:25.261
<v Speaker 5>because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really.</v>

268
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm sure it does some good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And especially maybe for some people,</v>

269
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.340
<v Speaker 5>maybe some people could use the boost of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vaccination,</v>

270
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.940
<v Speaker 5>but I think that from what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many different strains and </v>

271
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard for them to like to </v>
<v Speaker 5>predict which strain is think.</v>

272
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 5>I think they'd give you a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an amalgam of different ones.</v>

273
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 5>What they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

274
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 5>But usually there's one strong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very severe flu,</v>

275
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 5>whether it's swine flu or they are </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to be particularly severe.</v>

276
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:56.011
<v Speaker 5>So they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they inject you with a dead </v>

277
00:12:56.011 --> 00:12:58.891
<v Speaker 5>version,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it still give you a fever and stuff </v>

278
00:12:58.891 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 5>because it's a new agent in your body </v>
<v Speaker 5>and this and that.</v>

279
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all come from farms.</v>

280
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like almost all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the chicken flu or things </v>

281
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 5>jumping over from buying guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>germs and steel.</v>

282
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:12.590
<v Speaker 5>Jared diamond says agricultural status,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breezeway,</v>

283
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 5>nastier germs because animals from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cow pox,</v>

284
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 5>smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said.</v>

285
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 5>And the minute that that indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter gatherer tribes,</v>

286
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 5>because they were small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>always moving.</v>

287
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 5>So and epidemics couldn't really build </v>
<v Speaker 5>into those environments.</v>

288
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.550
<v Speaker 5>Usually you're Kinda kinda healthy being</v>
<v Speaker 5>at 100.</v>

289
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I like here in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>continent,</v>

290
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 5>like when they pass through the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Siberian stuff,</v>

291
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 5>they came down and really clean.</v>

292
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.850
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they leave there,</v>

293
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 5>they all say where they are and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>move.</v>

294
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 5>Whereas farmers live within their shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

295
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.150
<v Speaker 5>So that's when they would come in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's these big agricultural societies,</v>

296
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 5>not only they have systems of </v>
<v Speaker 5>governments because they can be more and</v>

297
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 5>they could grow more because they grow </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own food and stay in one place.</v>

298
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 5>But they breed nasty germs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

299
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by some accounts,</v>

300
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 5>the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the time after Cortez came back,</v>

301
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:07.651
<v Speaker 5>our Columbus Columbus came and they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about huge populations of in the</v>

302
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 5>Mississippi Delta and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know more about this.</v>

303
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:14.491
<v Speaker 5>And I do Stephen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then when they came back in 15 </v>

304
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:14.491
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody was there.</v>

305
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 5>It was literally did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they think that the talent are still</v>

306
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 5>doing epidemic killed off 95 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Americans.</v>

307
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 5>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I had my flu shot though.</v>

308
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:28.470
<v Speaker 5>And I'll tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we have like having that little </v>

309
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.790
<v Speaker 5>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

310
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.020
<v Speaker 5>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like any little thing that like any </v>

311
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.020
<v Speaker 5>paranoid thing I could say about having </v>
<v Speaker 5>a flu shot,</v>

312
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 5>like if you came home and gave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

313
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like I'd rather have an increased</v>

314
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 5>chance of something weird happening to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me then I don't think.</v>

315
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:41.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can give the food a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>

316
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.600
<v Speaker 5>They had their mother's immune system </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the breast milk is a real breast </v>

317
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 5>milk is pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she probably got the flu shot through</v>

318
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:50.430
<v Speaker 5>her mom anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

319
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.930
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How quickly</v>

320
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 1>brings him back from colds and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

321
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>There's everything there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little Body needs in that.</v>

322
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>That's really insane that your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes food.</v>

323
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really when you see a woman's body </v>

324
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.310
<v Speaker 1>produce food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a trip.</v>

325
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like really hard to wrap your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

326
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy that would use it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee creamer and stuff.</v>

327
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a freak.</v>

328
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I talked a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked a lot about drinks and I talked</v>

329
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>so much like for our first get talked so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much garbage,</v>

330
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:18.520
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

331
00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did it,</v>

332
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when the time came,</v>

333
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you guys a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get back to sucking on </v>

334
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>those things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange,</v>

335
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

336
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 1>once you think of them as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

337
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it makes it where the food comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for the,</v>

338
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>where the food comes out for the baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden you're like,</v>

339
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple of strange.</v>

340
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

341
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 1>what is that place exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when a man becomes a man.</v>

342
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>When the first time he just takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>there's like a state of grace where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for like six months,</v>

344
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 1>at least after she stops breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave them alone.</v>

345
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 1>But you can't mess with them during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding phase.</v>

346
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:05.890
<v Speaker 1>That's just rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy when you have children,</v>

347
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you see a woman goes through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do look at women differently.</v>

348
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

349
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my twenties,</v>

350
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>girls were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were soft boys.</v>

351
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

352
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:13.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

353
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll play with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you're not just like me?</v>

354
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't your mind like mine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can I get along with you?</v>

355
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean you fell asleep during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the raging bull.</v>

356
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Tell ranges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.020
<v Speaker 1>How do you not like fighting and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

358
00:16:24.021 --> 00:16:29.021
<v Speaker 1>but I thought that's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you realize a completely </v>

359
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally different species,</v>

360
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 1>different species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

361
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.470
<v Speaker 1>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my take has always been that we're never</v>

362
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 1>really the idea that we're gonna like </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another be able to understand</v>

363
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be pregnant or do we </v>
<v Speaker 1>even want to be pregnant?</v>

364
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea of being attracted to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

365
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like so alien to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Steve.</v>

366
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>We really told this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like guys that say like we're pregnant.</v>

367
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

368
00:16:57.531 --> 00:16:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife just had a baby.</v>

369
00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was like,</v>

370
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be like we just had a baby.</v>

371
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know we are pregnant is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>

372
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just had a baby's okay because you're</v>

373
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say my wife just had a baby.</v>

374
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I might say we just had a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely wouldn't say we're pregnant</v>

375
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

376
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be a solidarity thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>or how about guys who have sympathetic </v>

377
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.440
<v Speaker 1>with their breasts hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a guy just given up as balls way </v>

378
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 1>too quick too to just ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to drop him off.</v>

379
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling on himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stretched them out of themselves like</v>

380
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:36.050

<v Speaker 1>High and low dollar brother.</v>

411
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.351
<v Speaker 6>friend's houses are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I went over your place when you were </v>

<v Speaker 6>He didn't have a door.</v>

414
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.420
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It.</v>

415
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.270
<v Speaker 6>Didn't have a door knob.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not bullshitting.</v>

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.400
<v Speaker 6>He had a place in Venice and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a fucking door knob.</v>

417
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.420
<v Speaker 6>Humans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one time while he did have a door.</v>

418
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:08.421
<v Speaker 6>Now when you run into,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I literally didn't have a door knob and </v>

419
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:08.550
<v Speaker 6>people know what's going to break into </v>
<v Speaker 6>my house telling the story about the.</v>

420
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.150
<v Speaker 6>And so one day he fucking wakes up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a homeless lady inside his house</v>

421
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 6>cooking breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Literally,</v>

422
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 6>literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like cooking.</v>

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.010
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to call it on.</v>

424
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.080
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean I gotta go on.</v>

425
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 6>I'll actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't.</v>

426
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:21.960
<v Speaker 6>I didn't wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I came in,</v>

427
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:27.290
<v Speaker 6>I came into my neighbors go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a woman in your house cooking </v>

428
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:27.800
<v Speaker 6>and I come in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's got a meal prepared,</v>

429
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 6>she's got your pit bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

430
00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was feeding my dogs.</v>

431
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 6>Know you guys have children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she wasn't.</v>

432
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:39.501
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unfortunately it wasn't that attractive </v>

433
00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:39.501
<v Speaker 6>back then though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Listen.</v>

434
00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 6>But the being attractive wasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the criteria.</v>

435
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 6>If you were a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

436
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm in.</v>

437
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.620
<v Speaker 6>If you go to Ari Shaffir his house,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he tells me that sometimes he doesn't </v>

438
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:48.940
<v Speaker 6>change the sheets for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Skies,</v>

439
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.230
<v Speaker 6>dude in college.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Change my sheets.</v>

440
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.850
<v Speaker 6>Only one that changed girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only time I'd ever want.</v>

441
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:56.870
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

442
00:19:56.871 --> 00:20:01.871
<v Speaker 6>that's probably why it's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you get used to living camping style </v>

443
00:20:01.871 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 6>and you're hunting all the time like you</v>
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

444
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.930
<v Speaker 6>Like in college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we kept dishes in the sink for so long </v>

445
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.930
<v Speaker 6>in college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me and my two,</v>

446
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:14.020
<v Speaker 6>my two other roommates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I swear to God that we had shit growing </v>

447
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 6>out of the drain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We had sprouts in the drain.</v>

448
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:20.550
<v Speaker 6>We'd grown fucking sprouts show you that</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing that ruined my toilet.</v>

449
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.700
<v Speaker 6>They ever show you the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>growing up there was apparently a crack </v>

450
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.570
<v Speaker 6>in the pipe below my toilet and a route </v>
<v Speaker 6>got in there and grew to this size of </v>

451
00:20:30.331 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 6>like a Muskrat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy.</v>

452
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 6>It was like this long and it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>growing.</v>

453
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 6>It's like my toilet wouldn't flush or it</v>
<v Speaker 6>would drain really slowly.</v>

454
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:43.611
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't figure what is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was an organism living off my shit </v>

455
00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 6>water and we literally live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ring off my shit.</v>

456
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 6>Water and fat</v>

<v Speaker 5>It wasn't going to animal,</v>

459
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a bark.</v>

460
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:56.140
<v Speaker 5>A piece of pipe men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

462
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:04.021

<v Speaker 5>see that some editing called route </v>

463
00:21:04.021 --> 00:21:04.660
<v Speaker 5>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

464
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 5>You forced on her toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody being like really?</v>

465
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:13.231
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm so fussy now and fastidious </v>

466
00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 5>about my home now because at a point </v>
<v Speaker 5>like identify with your home,</v>

467
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:16.520
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

468
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.580
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like everything.</v>

469
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.680
<v Speaker 5>Just like I'd be like lining stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

470
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

471
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:27.140
<v Speaker 5>you're a father and you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't mess.</v>

472
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 5>I grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up in a neat home.</v>

473
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.260
<v Speaker 5>Take a break and then you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you like,</v>

474
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.260
<v Speaker 5>act like your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of true.</v>

475
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kinda grew up like,</v>

476
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.530
<v Speaker 5>I remember one day things had to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>neat.</v>

477
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 5>I got tired of the mess and things had </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be ordered and,</v>

478
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:47.330
<v Speaker 5>and simple and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what in the fuck that </v>

479
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.981
<v Speaker 5>happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know it happened some one day I </v>

480
00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:49.981
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just woke up.</v>

481
00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:50.010
<v Speaker 5>It's messy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to.</v>

482
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got tired of the message.</v>

483
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's hormonal think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

484
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.080
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's smart to have a clean environment </v>

485
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 5>when your environment is clean and makes</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think better.</v>

486
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.870
<v Speaker 5>If you're completely cluttered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly it.</v>

487
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.030
<v Speaker 5>Largely it's mental peace of mind when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>get up.</v>

488
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 5>If I'm writing or whatever and I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't write until the dishes and stuff</v>

489
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 5>are done really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in a way it's like a procrastination</v>

490
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.490
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

491
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 5>because it helps you put stuff off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you were really digital,</v>

492
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.310
<v Speaker 5>diligent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really discipline,</v>

493
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 5>you'd be able just to work through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mayhem,</v>

494
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

495
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:26.800
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's got to be like Nice,</v>

496
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 5>buttoned up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

497
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.190
<v Speaker 5>Jj,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jj Abrams,</v>

498
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:35.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy has directed and written </v>

499
00:22:35.191 --> 00:22:35.600
<v Speaker 5>everything created last to like every </v>
<v Speaker 5>genius and I,</v>

500
00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.950
<v Speaker 5>I just tested for to show up.</v>

501
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 5>Greg Rung Burke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's Heroes,</v>

502
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 5>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's his best friend since he was three.</v>

503
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:45.790
<v Speaker 5>And then Greg's a great guy and he said </v>
<v Speaker 5>that when he pitches Jj Abrams and idea,</v>

504
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.110
<v Speaker 5>Jason Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear it,</v>

505
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:48.010
<v Speaker 5>write it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

506
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:48.920
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just want to hear if that,</v>

507
00:22:48.921 --> 00:22:50.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to end it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

508
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 5>why are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

509
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 5>the energy that you're using right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the energy that you're excited about</v>

510
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:55.790
<v Speaker 5>should be in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

511
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 5>you should be doing this with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy.</v>

512
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 5>Why are you not doing this with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>entity?</v>

513
00:22:58.871 --> 00:23:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Why not writing that energy into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea?</v>

514
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Because this is procrastination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

515
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 5>You're waiting for my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's procrastination.</v>

516
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.140
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he wastes no time.</v>

517
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 5>His all his energy is is that we use for</v>
<v Speaker 5>to worry or to think about other things.</v>

518
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.890
<v Speaker 5>It's in its.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes right into his channeled under </v>

519
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 5>that Jack Son of a bitch to step down </v>
<v Speaker 5>and in the last season he talked to a </v>

520
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:31.110
<v Speaker 5>pilot guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He dialed it in the last season I gave </v>

521
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.110
<v Speaker 5>up on loss because of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

522
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.890
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't say it.</v>

523
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 5>I've been obsessed with breaking bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

524
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:37.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost done with last for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>brilliant.</v>

525
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:39.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm just fucking around about the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he's out there,</v>

526
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.300
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just.</v>

527
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.770
<v Speaker 5>It was one episode that was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it was like.</v>

528
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 5>They were by a puddle that brings</v>

529
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 1>people back to life or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and he's just standing there like,</v>

530
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the last guy,</v>

531
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>like they went off the crazy train life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

532
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I've ever watched time traveling back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth.</v>

533
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

534
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.400

<v Speaker 1>Whatever happened to those polar bears.</v>

535
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Where are those ended up being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>purgatory,</v>

536
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:07.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what the.</v>

537
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even stick around to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

538
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:14.081
<v Speaker 1>whatever the wind monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the wind monster come and fuck </v>

<v Speaker 1>everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great show,</v>

540
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.930
<v Speaker 1>great show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wondering what was going on.</v>

541
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 1>It must be so hard to do some blending </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

542
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Do a show like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to create it.</v>

543
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Keep coming up with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just basically,</v>

544
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep it.</v>

545
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep surprising your </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience for years.</v>

546
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It was a brilliant show for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a brilliant show that really left </v>

547
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.510
<v Speaker 1>you hanging on the edge of your seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved,</v>

548
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:40.511
<v Speaker 1>I got onto it on the DVD form though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got to watch like a whole shitload </v>

549
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.160
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched like the first two seasons in </v>

551
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:47.280
<v Speaker 1>a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 1>so it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

553
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 1>like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get tortured.</v>

554
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I got to do that with home.</v>

555
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:55.800
<v Speaker 3>That like style a TV watch has changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the TV experience in a way.</v>

556
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

557
00:24:57.001 --> 00:25:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Because I think like just the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

558
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a cereal being like everyone has this</v>

559
00:25:02.491 --> 00:25:06.030
<v Speaker 3>cliffhanger element and there'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>time to anticipate,</v>

560
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 3>but now I think it's largely </v>
<v Speaker 3>generational,</v>

561
00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:11.760
<v Speaker 3>but now you get turned onto something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

562
00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:12.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I going to do that?</v>

563
00:25:12.481 --> 00:25:15.390
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go random and watched the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing all the way through.</v>

564
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:21.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just a way different experience and</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like watching a little bit and </v>

565
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.991
<v Speaker 3>then for a week thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching a little bit and I think you </v>

566
00:25:23.991 --> 00:25:23.991
<v Speaker 3>burn out faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

567
00:25:23.991 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 3>every time I'd get into Charlotte and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>get interesting to show my wife and I </v>

568
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.091
<v Speaker 3>will just go netflix that or rent or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever and we and we burn out before </v>

569
00:25:31.091 --> 00:25:35.211
<v Speaker 3>you would because it's not meant to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to sit there and </v>

570
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 3>watch for half hours in a row or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something</v>

571
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.740
<v Speaker 1>unless you're Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

572
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Know you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can watch it either.</v>

573
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

574
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get eight episodes in and </v>

575
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

576
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to play.</v>

577
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.210
<v Speaker 1>What are your favorite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

578
00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a favorite TV show?</v>

<v Speaker 3>but if the show I like,</v>

582
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.000

<v Speaker 3>I watched.</v>

583
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 3>I like curb your enthusiasm but I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it.</v>

584
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 3>It's don't you like comedies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like stuff that's so far.</v>

585
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.420
<v Speaker 3>I like some of this is so far removed </v>
<v Speaker 3>from anything in my life or anything </v>

586
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 3>that I do or think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

587
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:22.061
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just like a show like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like a comedy like that is funny </v>

<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't.</v>

589
00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:24.320
<v Speaker 3>I just have never been that interested </v>
<v Speaker 3>in watching TV shows.</v>

590
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to watch movies a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll watch a lot of foreign movies.</v>

592
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:34.751
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want stuff that's just coming at </v>

593
00:26:34.751 --> 00:26:34.751
<v Speaker 3>me from way outside.</v>

594
00:26:34.751 --> 00:26:36.730
<v Speaker 1>There's so many good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like drama,</v>

595
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:41.790
<v Speaker 1>TV shows now there's so many shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like breaking bad.</v>

596
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's so hard</v>

597
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 7>to make movies right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that going into TV?</v>

598
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.030
<v Speaker 7>You're getting these like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that homeland show.</v>

599
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 7>That's a fucking unbelievably good show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that is seen four episodes.</v>

600
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:58.190
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to watch breaking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm on that too.</v>

601
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 7>It gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gets it,</v>

602
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 7>keeps getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The that shows incredible.</v>

603
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.180
<v Speaker 7>That's a good fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's like this is like a movie,</v>

604
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:11.181
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like watching like this is like movie </v>

605
00:27:11.181 --> 00:27:13.281
<v Speaker 7>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whereas before you were watching like </v>

606
00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:13.281
<v Speaker 7>the $6,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

607
00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>TV,</v>

608
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:20.770
<v Speaker 7>it was like filled with dog shit in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>golden age of TV and so I really think </v>

609
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:20.770
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

610
00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.280
<v Speaker 3>But the thing I always feel about tv </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I watch and dramas,</v>

611
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.400
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm watching people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like oftentimes I feel like it's being </v>

612
00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.421
<v Speaker 3>written from an angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really understand the world </v>

613
00:27:34.421 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 3>they're writing about like a period </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece type shit thing.</v>

614
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Like the Hbo Vampire Show where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

615
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.850
<v Speaker 3>it's like a bunch of dudes like </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagining the south.</v>

616
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it,</v>

617
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.810
<v Speaker 3>it'll be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh heck,</v>

618
00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:51.811
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just kind of to be like anything </v>

619
00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:51.811
<v Speaker 3>you've ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know.</v>

620
00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:51.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

621
00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know enough to know that it just </v>

622
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 3>feels like someone picturing what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like in their world.</v>

623
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who created it,</v>

624
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I lived in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have liked that</v>

625
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.150
<v Speaker 7>Paul was from the south and he was a gay</v>
<v Speaker 7>man in the south.</v>

626
00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 7>And I think if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you watch trueblood vampires,</v>

627
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.800
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's his experience.</v>

628
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.700
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

629
00:28:09.701 --> 00:28:10.850
<v Speaker 7>I don't mean to put.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know Alex,</v>

630
00:28:10.851 --> 00:28:15.851
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to put words in his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think I think it's been a vampire </v>

631
00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:17.170
<v Speaker 7>in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like this take place is what it was.</v>

632
00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.590
<v Speaker 7>It felt like to be gay when you were </v>
<v Speaker 7>younger and it was a violent place,</v>

633
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.600
<v Speaker 7>like really can't be true,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think was a book or something like</v>

634
00:28:26.201 --> 00:28:27.580
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think that at the end of the day,</v>

635
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:32.320
<v Speaker 7>if you can hear so you can see so much </v>
<v Speaker 7>of what it was like to be gay as a young</v>

636
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.850
<v Speaker 7>boy growing up in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

637
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.740
<v Speaker 7>just knowing that they can make a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I believe I saw thing and </v>

638
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.010
<v Speaker 7>that's what made that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

639
00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:42.560
<v Speaker 7>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't,</v>

640
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.330
<v Speaker 7>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wish I was like,</v>

641
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.090
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to do with gender,</v>
<v Speaker 7>gender analysis of the TV show.</v>

642
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.470
<v Speaker 7>I find it fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been,</v>

643
00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 7>I've been really fixated on this lately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How pussified movies and television and </v>

644
00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:06.781
<v Speaker 7>getting to the point where the vampires </v>
<v Speaker 7>that we have to do not like vampires to </v>

645
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:10.120
<v Speaker 7>like they can be kind of your buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

646
00:29:10.121 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 7>they can hang out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nine.</v>

647
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.970
<v Speaker 7>Oh two one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

648
00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:14.470
<v Speaker 7>with vampires man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like why?</v>

649
00:29:14.471 --> 00:29:19.471
<v Speaker 7>But why Vampires?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like why would you want to make like </v>

650
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:22.111
<v Speaker 7>this horrific monster and change its </v>
<v Speaker 7>nature and tournament to this romantic </v>

651
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 7>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what did.</v>

652
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.560
<v Speaker 7>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but my point is what I'm freaking out </v>

653
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:27.560
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like this whole trend,</v>

654
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.500
<v Speaker 7>like that Bourne movie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

655
00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:32.050
<v Speaker 7>that Bourne ultimatum or the fucking is </v>
<v Speaker 7>the new dude.</v>

656
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:37.330
<v Speaker 7>No Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty fucking bad ass Jeremy </v>

657
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:37.330
<v Speaker 7>Renner.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's bad ass.</v>

658
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 7>He gets no posting and the whole moving </v>
<v Speaker 7>saves.</v>

659
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.910
<v Speaker 7>Everybody girl's weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's all over him.</v>

660
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 7>But there's never a kiss.</v>

661
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.290
<v Speaker 7>Never any desire on his part ever </v>
<v Speaker 7>exhibited these,</v>

662
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.250
<v Speaker 7>even remotely attracted to these </v>
<v Speaker 7>unbelievably hot women that he just keep</v>

663
00:29:52.251 --> 00:29:57.251
<v Speaker 7>saving and they're falling in love with </v>
<v Speaker 7>him and he's just kinda like blank and </v>

664
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 7>nonchalant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like what the fuck is the message?</v>

665
00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are we becoming,</v>

666
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.420
<v Speaker 7>we want superheroes to be robot men </v>
<v Speaker 7>there to service women and keep them </v>

667
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:07.700
<v Speaker 7>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's like the,</v>

668
00:30:07.701 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 7>the ultimate goal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But no sex at the end of the movie.</v>

669
00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 7>There's sitting on a boat together,</v>
<v Speaker 7>throw it in a love interest.</v>

670
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:17.100
<v Speaker 7>Unless it was a loving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wasn't luncheons clearly.</v>

671
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean he saving her.</v>

672
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

673
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 7>the idea is that he's not really a </v>
<v Speaker 7>single and she's hot.</v>

674
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 7>I mean come on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do we.</v>

675
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:28.730
<v Speaker 7>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We live in a really interesting </v>

676
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.071
<v Speaker 7>observation though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because if you actually think about it </v>

677
00:30:32.071 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 7>like the TV shows I've seen even </v>
<v Speaker 7>homeland and,</v>

678
00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:33.240
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

679
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.190
<v Speaker 7>and certainly breaking bad,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the sex is,</v>

680
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.540
<v Speaker 7>there is nonexistent.</v>

681
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in fact,</v>

682
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 7>your heroes aren't even allowed to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>lusty or any of that stuff.</v>

683
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:43.820
<v Speaker 7>They're not allowed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>holy fuck.</v>

684
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:44.550
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

685
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 7>I only saw the first five episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I don't know,</v>

686
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 7>but they get their goal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's just interesting how that,</v>

687
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I wonder if that's true.</v>

688
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 7>It sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it sounds good.</v>

689
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:58.231
<v Speaker 7>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just feel like there's some </v>

690
00:30:58.231 --> 00:30:58.231
<v Speaker 7>pussification going on and on a giant </v>
<v Speaker 7>scale.</v>

691
00:30:58.231 --> 00:31:00.670
<v Speaker 7>It's like this toning down of male </v>
<v Speaker 7>energy.</v>

692
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.700
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look at fucking every show on NBC </v>

693
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.980
<v Speaker 7>community.</v>

<v Speaker 7>I don't want a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for whatever reason is not sexually </v>

706
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:41.170
<v Speaker 7>attracted as chicky saving.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This guy's a sociopath.</v>

707
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.200
<v Speaker 7>He's a fucking psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's just out there kicking ass and he </v>

708
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.871
<v Speaker 7>doesn't want to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't want them to be like monastic </v>

709
00:31:48.871 --> 00:31:48.871
<v Speaker 7>to hill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

710
00:31:48.871 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 7>You mean the beginning of the movie like</v>
<v Speaker 7>comes out of the water and he's like,</v>

711
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.490
<v Speaker 7>it's freezing cold,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's naked.</v>

712
00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:54.930
<v Speaker 7>He's not even fucking freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not even shivering.</v>

713
00:31:54.931 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 7>It's just so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shriveled up.</v>

714
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:57.710
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

715
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's stoker road track Kyla in some </v>

716
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.901
<v Speaker 7>ways as a reaction to the Victoria and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the repressive Victorian age.</v>

717
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:11.941
<v Speaker 7>So when Dracula would come and he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 7>this big handsome guy and a girl was </v>

718
00:32:11.941 --> 00:32:13.060
<v Speaker 7>sleeping and he would fight her neck and</v>
<v Speaker 7>drink or blood.</v>

719
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:18.061
<v Speaker 7>It was very kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The idea was she had an orgasm when she </v>

720
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.530
<v Speaker 7>was being sucked dry is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was Kinda like a very taboo book when</v>

721
00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 7>it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was very,</v>

722
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 7>it was kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a rebuttal to how repressively sexual,</v>

723
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the victorians were.</v>

724
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 7>And Brahm Stoker wrote sort of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that reaction to it.</v>

725
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 7>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I always thought it was just a fictional</v>

726
00:32:34.091 --> 00:32:37.380
<v Speaker 7>movie or book rather,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a written about a vampire.</v>

727
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.890
<v Speaker 7>Just an angry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What was the connection between the Vlad</v>

728
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:40.610
<v Speaker 7>typists</v>

729
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.230
<v Speaker 1>because there was a vlad the impaler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the original Count Dracula.</v>

730
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 1>They say that the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

731
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on this Hungarian,</v>

732
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe a prince or a warlord or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

733
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 1>who was an evil mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably a serial killer,</v>

734
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 1>probably serial killer who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 1>did all kinds of horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would cook pieces of people and eat </v>

736
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 1>it in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

737
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

738
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 1>he would put people on stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

739
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what they call him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vlad the impaler.</v>

740
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:12.240
<v Speaker 1>He would shove stakes up their ass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then let them slowly rive in pain and </v>

741
00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:15.060
<v Speaker 1>just associate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would leave them on,</v>

742
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.710
<v Speaker 1>on these big pillars like all through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the town.</v>

744
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.040
<v Speaker 1>He was an unbelievable evil guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the depictions and images of him or </v>

745
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 1>him dining with like all these men on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stakes,</v>

746
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 1>like all around you about these things.</v>

747
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Ivan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible in Russia when,</v>

748
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

749
00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the artist was that did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter palace.</v>

750
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the winter palace like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful,</v>

751
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

752
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.160
<v Speaker 1>There was a lifetime of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 1>20 years of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like his opus,</v>

754
00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 1>this great artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at it,</v>

755
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 1>it's I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's out of the winter palace to</v>

756
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:51.311
<v Speaker 1>her discharge this incredible church in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and when he was done with it and </v>

757
00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:53.510
<v Speaker 1>he presented it to Ivan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible Ivan,</v>

758
00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>the terrible was like this is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible thing in the world.</v>

759
00:33:55.881 --> 00:34:00.881
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he took his eyes out so he </v>

760
00:34:00.881 --> 00:34:00.881
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

761
00:34:00.881 --> 00:34:02.630
<v Speaker 1>this is a good point that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

762
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you could be a serial killer and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the exact right situation where </v>

763
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of power and just be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just do it,</v>

764
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but it'd just be normal.</v>

765
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that woman who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for killing thousands that </v>

766
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.220
<v Speaker 1>she was a noble woman and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

767

768
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotTa pull this up on wikipedia </v>

771
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.470

<v Speaker 1>There's a book called the murder room,</v>

772
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 1>and the guy who specializes in sadism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and serial killers,</v>

773
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.740
<v Speaker 1>he wrote what's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like the double helix of the </v>

774
00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.690
<v Speaker 1>serial killers profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that a lot of serial killers will </v>

776
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:44.691
<v Speaker 1>definitely be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't camera what the word was,</v>

777
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:46.580

<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they locked her in a room.</v>

791
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 1>They gave her like a house imprisonment.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like I have a particular taste like </v>

800
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.190
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be a specific kind of </v>

803
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:59.630
<v Speaker 5>something that snaps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allows you to get a thrill off of </v>

804
00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.891
<v Speaker 5>killing a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's a weird thing that happens </v>

00:36:03.891 --> 00:36:06.171
<v Speaker 5>to people with this whole royalty thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>When the English student,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what Americans do it.</v>

810
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.230
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's their version of Kim Kardashian.</v>

811
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.500
<v Speaker 5>It's the same fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's this.</v>

812
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.240
<v Speaker 5>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are their father?</v>

813
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:32.530
<v Speaker 5>Father met a count or do my duke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a duke and and they were at </v>

814
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.140
<v Speaker 5>dinner and somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

815
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.190
<v Speaker 5>He said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing at all.</v>

816
00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:39.930
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so natural for.</v>

817
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.220
<v Speaker 5>I take a stipend from the English </v>
<v Speaker 5>government anyway,</v>

818
00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:43.530
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

819
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.890
<v Speaker 5>Of course I don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

825
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.400
<v Speaker 5>he was present when he worked on Ali and</v>
<v Speaker 5>for some reason or another,</v>

826
00:37:00.401 --> 00:37:05.401
<v Speaker 5>I remember how it came up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was like presented to one of the </v>

827
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 5>British royalty and it was like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes in and breaks down.</v>

828
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:08.010
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he comes in,</v>

829
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.750
<v Speaker 5>don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do that.</v>

830
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 5>Put these gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

831
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody said that to me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said you want,</v>

835
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:22.700
<v Speaker 5>in his defense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like every like every part of you </v>

836
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.700
<v Speaker 5>wants to just say like no way.</v>

837
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.990
<v Speaker 5>No way because you're part of this other</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

838
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Like you're there with a ritual and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're with people were at work.</v>

839
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 5>You kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could make like my statement,</v>

840
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.620
<v Speaker 5>like I could express my liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

841
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.610
<v Speaker 5>and like my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that I'm not deferential at the</v>

842
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 5>expense of like all this other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going on and he's like in the end</v>

843
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:46.560
<v Speaker 5>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like,</v>

844
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.590
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like covering your head in a </v>

845
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:51.590
<v Speaker 5>synagogue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like covering your shoulders.</v>

846
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.360
<v Speaker 5>If you're a woman in Italian church </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

847
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 5>there becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a ritual and a protocol to </v>

848
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.071
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the things that traditional with </v>

849
00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:01.071
<v Speaker 5>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

850
00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 5>there's something much more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a much more deep seated,</v>

851
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.880
<v Speaker 5>but this is just strictly like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll honor you because you belong to </v>

852
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 5>some lineage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really quite sure how it came to</v>

853
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 5>be and I'm not sure on the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 5>regulations how it gets passed along.</v>

854
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 5>But you were picking you to now be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>one that were deferential through,</v>

855
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 5>but it's actually a little cover on </v>
<v Speaker 5>American,</v>

856
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.570
<v Speaker 5>very everything that we don't stand for </v>
<v Speaker 5>will I get the fuck outta here with your</v>

857
00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 5>crown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in Britain,</v>

858
00:38:28.921 --> 00:38:33.921
<v Speaker 5>in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had what's called the great chain </v>

859
00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:33.921
<v Speaker 5>of being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very.</v>

860
00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:37.221
<v Speaker 5>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very central to sort of the British </v>

861
00:38:37.221 --> 00:38:37.221
<v Speaker 5>history and character</v>

862
00:38:37.221 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 6>of the notion that the king,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the God was there,</v>

863
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:39.900
<v Speaker 6>the king was bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you had the aristocracy,</v>

864
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 6>then you had no ability.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you had the merchant class,</v>

865
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:43.750
<v Speaker 6>then you had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know the serfs.</v>

866
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.280
<v Speaker 6>Where does game of thrones fit in there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

867
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 6>you never stepped out of for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why Britain was.</v>

868
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 6>It benefited from the notion that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>had very strong institutions and so when</v>

869
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:59.731
<v Speaker 6>you had a royal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a royal person that you came in contact </v>

870
00:38:59.731 --> 00:39:02.761
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was very important to observe ritual </v>

871
00:39:02.761 --> 00:39:06.450
<v Speaker 6>protocol and ritual sort of greeting and</v>
<v Speaker 6>interaction because it kept the wall </v>

872
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:12.271
<v Speaker 6>between you and and the royalty because </v>
<v Speaker 6>the entire society with the benefit of </v>

873
00:39:12.311 --> 00:39:12.970
<v Speaker 6>the royalty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

874
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the but also the whole society was </v>

875
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.060
<v Speaker 6>built on not only the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of,</v>

876
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.280
<v Speaker 6>of this caste system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but also very central to the British </v>

877
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.361
<v Speaker 6>character was that to esteem out of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>class was actually considered heretical.</v>

878
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 6>It was considered a to the detriment of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the entire community and society.</v>

879
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:38.101
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas Americans were like on thinking </v>

880
00:39:38.101 --> 00:39:38.640
<v Speaker 6>about his climb and the fuck out of this</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole,</v>

881
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's interesting,</v>

882
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people that believe that a </v>
<v Speaker 6>society like ours,</v>

883
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:48.510
<v Speaker 6>or at least how ours initially was born </v>
<v Speaker 6>is only built in response to </v>

884
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:54.571
<v Speaker 6>suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you have to have a situation </v>

885
00:39:54.571 --> 00:39:56.020
<v Speaker 6>like England where they're completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>suppressing it to the point where you're</v>

886
00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:59.800
<v Speaker 6>willing to take such a great chance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you already have a semblance of idea</v>

887
00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:03.310
<v Speaker 6>of order and society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is based on their system of canes.</v>

888
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.520
<v Speaker 6>And that's the weirdest thing is it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost like the only way for us to ever </v>

889
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 6>gotten to a position of power or </v>
<v Speaker 6>position of,</v>

890
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

891
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.530
<v Speaker 6>creating a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>creating civilization is that somebody </v>

892
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.831
<v Speaker 6>had to take control and that ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 6>we are these weird fucking Alpha Apes.</v>

893
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:26.550
<v Speaker 6>And we really want to be like led by </v>
<v Speaker 6>like one person or one group or one </v>

894
00:40:27.011 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 6>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or at least have someone at the very top</v>

895
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.800
<v Speaker 6>that we can all agree to clap for.</v>

896
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.280
<v Speaker 6>And until we fill that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it becomes this wild fucking power </v>

897
00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:44.761
<v Speaker 6>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like the only way we can work </v>

898
00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:44.761
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's through one person.</v>

899
00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:49.620
<v Speaker 6>It almost seems like what's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 6>though is the founding fathers had a </v>

900
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.471
<v Speaker 6>rebuttal to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And George Washington and most famously </v>

901
00:40:52.471 --> 00:40:54.811
<v Speaker 6>when they wanted to make him king said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am not only going to not be the king </v>

902
00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Speaker 6>because we don't have kings in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>country where we have presidents that </v>

903
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.771
<v Speaker 6>are part of a structure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a structure that is directly responsible</v>

904
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:03.070
<v Speaker 6>to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

905
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:03.900
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

906
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.170
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

907
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was sort of the idea.</v>

908
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:12.241
<v Speaker 6>And King George,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he found out that Washington had </v>

909
00:41:12.241 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 6>refused the kingship and instead went </v>
<v Speaker 6>and fucking retired was like,</v>

910
00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 6>that guy's the greatest guy of all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>American character.</v>

911
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was kind of sealed as.</v>

912
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Speaker 6>That was the great example of George </v>
<v Speaker 6>Washington did.</v>

913
00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't ever call me king because that's.</v>

914
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.390
<v Speaker 6>That is exactly what we thought against </v>
<v Speaker 6>sleazy.</v>

915
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.350
<v Speaker 6>The exact opposite of this guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>running Egypt now,</v>

916
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.670
<v Speaker 6>who tried to turn himself into a king,</v>
<v Speaker 6>mostly most of them,</v>

917
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 6>a little more sluggish and crazy.</v>

918
00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.910
<v Speaker 5>It's so bewildering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

919
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny the way people act when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you turn,</v>

920
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 5>when you turn the tide on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

921
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:42.680
<v Speaker 5>it's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

922
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:47.770
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I understand what Mubarak was </v>

923
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:47.770
<v Speaker 5>fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

924
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:48.380
<v Speaker 5>he's just this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

925
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:54.100
<v Speaker 5>That's unfortunately a great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the biggest challenge for the </v>

926
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 5>Arab nations is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

927
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.340
<v Speaker 5>is learning the benefits of democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not get through that case system.</v>

928
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:04.451
<v Speaker 5>They look at Molokai in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we basically created a Saddam light </v>

929
00:42:04.451 --> 00:42:05.900
<v Speaker 5>because Molokini now has his own police </v>
<v Speaker 5>force.</v>

930
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 5>The reports directly to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

931
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:13.721
<v Speaker 5>he's still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why the Sudanese are setting off </v>

932
00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:17.201
<v Speaker 5>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's still whether or not he can </v>

933
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:17.201
<v Speaker 5>share power as a whole different story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

934
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:21.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it with like watching the Arab </v>

935
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:21.700
<v Speaker 5>spring stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

936
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.030
<v Speaker 5>I was always skeptical of it and one </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

937
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 5>one way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was always kind of embarrassing,</v>

938
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 5>like just understanding the history of </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of those areas,</v>

939
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 5>the way Americans would so quickly </v>
<v Speaker 5>forget our allegiances and so,</v>

940
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going against Qaddafi and like </v>

941
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:37.340
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

942
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number one us enemy could be like </v>

943
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:40.331
<v Speaker 5>for getting the.</v>

944
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:41.190
<v Speaker 5>We were doing all kinds of things </v>
<v Speaker 5>through there and you know,</v>

945
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 5>and in some ways supporting Mubarak in </v>
<v Speaker 5>some ways,</v>

946
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>later on in some ways we support them in</v>

947
00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:50.841
<v Speaker 5>burke for 30 years and then so we gave </v>
<v Speaker 5>$10 and eight every year and 3 billion </v>

948
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.390
<v Speaker 5>year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

949
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.180
<v Speaker 5>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then this so quickly people.</v>

950
00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.440
<v Speaker 5>But so quickly people wanted to make the</v>
<v Speaker 5>jump that like here's this logical </v>

951
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:02.440
<v Speaker 5>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

952
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.330
<v Speaker 5>And that was frustrating a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the main thing is when I was </v>

953
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:07.330
<v Speaker 5>watching all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to be optimistic,</v>

954
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:12.070
<v Speaker 5>but I just feel like there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just going to be smooth </v>

955
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.921
<v Speaker 5>transition and there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this competing idea like when </v>

956
00:43:14.921 --> 00:43:18.671
<v Speaker 5>you're an American who's like this </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing idea we have between being </v>

957
00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:18.671
<v Speaker 5>pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

958
00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:22.600
<v Speaker 5>like we want these countries to be such </v>
<v Speaker 5>and such way in order to secure our </v>

959
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.691
<v Speaker 5>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also we had this thing where it's </v>

960
00:43:25.691 --> 00:43:27.711
<v Speaker 5>like the only legitimate form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>government is a democracy and as we're </v>

961
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 5>going to find again and again and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely not.</v>

962
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely not an expert on rural </v>

963
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.741
<v Speaker 5>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're finding again and again that </v>

964
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:39.940
<v Speaker 5>other countries being democracies isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>always going to serve our own national </v>

965
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:39.940
<v Speaker 5>security interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

966
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 5>I think that we want to think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that dovetail and it's not gonna be</v>

967
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:48.011
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe they're better off having </v>

968
00:43:48.011 --> 00:43:50.441
<v Speaker 5>kings was depends on the actual actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>people on the ground in those countries </v>

969
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

970
00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 5>I want to support democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's someone like,</v>

971
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>collect and you're like,</v>

972
00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.200
<v Speaker 5>that's not a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Democracy is voting for the guys.</v>

973
00:44:00.201 --> 00:44:05.201
<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just depends on how you define it </v>

974
00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:05.201
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're already parker,</v>

975
00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:05.630
<v Speaker 5>I believe that's his name was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that British MP,</v>

976
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.130
<v Speaker 5>a part of the parliament and he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's walked these.</v>

977
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.260
<v Speaker 5>He's walked every remote village in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan,</v>

978
00:44:10.261 --> 00:44:14.180
<v Speaker 5>every remote village in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said he'd never been anywhere,</v>

979
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.030
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any room,</v>

980
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.940
<v Speaker 5>even the most remote village in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan.</v>

981
00:44:16.941 --> 00:44:19.400
<v Speaker 5>He never met anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody,</v>

982
00:44:19.401 --> 00:44:22.340
<v Speaker 5>no matter how strong their tribal notion</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the tribal systems,</v>

983
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Speaker 5>where he never met anybody who didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want some say in who covered them,</v>

984
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.130
<v Speaker 5>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's.</v>

985
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 5>That seems to be a human,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a need and a human right</v>

986
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 6>and a human compulsion to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have some say in who fucking </v>

987
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.270
<v Speaker 6>otherwise you get a guy like Ivan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the terrible who just amassed this </v>

988
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.270
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all have a natural.</v>

989
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 6>We all have a natural revulsion for </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

990
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.440
<v Speaker 6>We all have a natural kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do think you're right that human </v>

991
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.501
<v Speaker 6>beings need an alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a leader and they always find the </v>

992
00:44:51.501 --> 00:44:54.291
<v Speaker 6>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I also think at the same time they </v>

993
00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.301
<v Speaker 6>want some say in that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in that process and in the ongoing </v>

994
00:44:56.301 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 6>process that is who governs them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

995
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 6>and it really feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we talked about with kids,</v>

996
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:06.441
<v Speaker 6>if you try to take a spoon out of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand without explaining that you need </v>

997
00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:06.441
<v Speaker 6>the spoon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

998
00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll hold onto that fucking spoon </v>

999
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.290
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and human being seemed to have a </v>

1000
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 6>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a natural resistance to those that would</v>

1001
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 6>have power over them.</v>

1002
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you think you're going to be the </v>

1003
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 6>president and everything's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>smooth sailing,</v>

1004
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:25.340
<v Speaker 6>you know how many haters you must have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The moment I think that's probably half </v>

1005
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.911
<v Speaker 6>the gray,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the gray is realizing how many fucking </v>

1006
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:28.911
<v Speaker 6>people hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

1007
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:31.270
<v Speaker 6>Those guys age badly and mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can't just be this.</v>

1008
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:36.350
<v Speaker 6>You make one choice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to make 50 percent of the </v>

1009
00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:36.350
<v Speaker 6>people happy and 50 percent of the other</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

1010
00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 6>the way they got it carved out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's 51 percent.</v>

1011
00:45:38.671 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 6>It's like they got to carve down to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 6>point one percent,</v>

1012
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:46.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to find books about you </v>

1013
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.891
<v Speaker 6>and how much we give Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every year they're going to write books </v>

1014
00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 6>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to make up lies about you.</v>

1015
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.760
<v Speaker 6>They're going to constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every person on the opposite side of the</v>

1016
00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:55.770
<v Speaker 6>fence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it be Democrat on your side,</v>

1017
00:45:55.771 --> 00:46:00.771
<v Speaker 6>repo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoever's on the other team they're </v>

1018
00:46:00.771 --> 00:46:00.771
<v Speaker 6>going after,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1019
00:46:00.771 --> 00:46:05.300
<v Speaker 6>No one ever does it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then no one ever does it for four </v>

1020
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:05.300
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has maybe they have,</v>

1021
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.260
<v Speaker 6>if they would ever done it for four </v>
<v Speaker 6>years and just said,</v>

1022
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't for me.</v>

1023
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.230
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1024
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 6>not enjoy something like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as much as I hate this,</v>

1025
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I also think that whoever got you into </v>

1026
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:16.200
<v Speaker 6>that position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you will,</v>

1027
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.890
<v Speaker 6>you owe them this obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always think about what George Bush </v>

1028
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:20.890
<v Speaker 6>said about her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1029
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 6>Hurricane Katrina.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>

1030
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:25.110
<v Speaker 6>you didn't go down to New Orleans for </v>
<v Speaker 6>five days or whatever.</v>

1031
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.520
<v Speaker 6>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1032
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 6>here's the problem with me going out in </v>
<v Speaker 6>New Orleans during that crisis,</v>

1033
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.300
<v Speaker 6>if I go down to New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to take 60 police cars and and,</v>

1034
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:39.330
<v Speaker 6>and the resources of the city to protect</v>
<v Speaker 6>me and to escort me to the damage sites.</v>

1035
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:42.720
<v Speaker 6>It costs a million dollars an hour when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you tie up a helicopter,</v>

1036
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 6>helicopter type of all the rescue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the stuff that should be given to </v>

1037
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 6>the people on the ground at that time.</v>

1038
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:55.340
<v Speaker 6>And he said that was the catch 22.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going to get criticized if I land </v>

1039
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.391
<v Speaker 6>air force one the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the examples of being </v>

1040
00:46:59.391 --> 00:47:03.861
<v Speaker 6>a president and you were always the idea</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you have to physically be in an </v>

1041
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:09.111
<v Speaker 6>area in order to observe or to respect </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that a tragic incident is took </v>

1042
00:47:09.111 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 6>places,</v>
<v Speaker 6>observed its pageantry man,</v>

1043
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Speaker 6>because it's like you're playing a </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychological game.</v>

1044
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.260
<v Speaker 6>I would always hand it to someone if you</v>
<v Speaker 6>could,</v>

1045
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 6>if you could make that point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But people are like,</v>

1046
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 6>people are so addicted to the pageantry </v>
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

1047
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:21.510
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

1048
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:25.920
<v Speaker 6>in order for us to recover from this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need to fly around in a helicopter and</v>

1049
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:29.100
<v Speaker 6>have a governor show me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>flooded because I'm not going to believe</v>

1050
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1051
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 5>Be Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1052
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:35.851
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a visitors come to visit us </v>

1053
00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 5>pageant trees at great word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1054
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 5>I love the joke that Jeff Ross got up </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the standard.</v>

1055
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 5>We did this a charity and after </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurricane Katrina and he goes,</v>

1056
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:48.060
<v Speaker 5>I went down there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that bad.</v>

1057
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1058
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 5>fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the way he said it was,</v>

1059
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so ridiculous.</v>

1060
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.720
<v Speaker 5>Like that was his job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1061
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:59.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't see what the big deal lips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1062
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:00.790
<v Speaker 5>he was kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used,</v>

1063
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:06.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be a higher incidence </v>

1064
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 5>of those fucking gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred year storm is going to be.</v>

1065
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:08.400
<v Speaker 5>There already is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1066
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.640
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be even higher because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're together and I was supposed to go </v>

1067
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.710
<v Speaker 5>to Texas and I flew home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I flew home for that thing,</v>

1068
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 5>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the.</v>

1069
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.610
<v Speaker 5>That was sandy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sandy said I wasn't.</v>

1070
00:48:19.611 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in.</v>

1071
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went home to be with my family and I </v>

1072
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.170
<v Speaker 5>was there and if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you were in my place you would and </v>

1073
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 5>you didn't have the news or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would adjust that mic a little windy</v>

1074
00:48:32.921 --> 00:48:35.880
<v Speaker 5>last night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a mile away or not even a mile,</v>

1075
00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 5>a half mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cars like floating down the streets and </v>

1076
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was so crazy.</v>

1077
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well no,</v>

1078
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 5>it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was so much the storm search.</v>

1079
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't mean like if you were,</v>

1080
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:50.130
<v Speaker 5>if you got above a certain elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1081
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 5>you were fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

1082
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:56.130
<v Speaker 5>he would never have ever have known.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like there was a few more leaves </v>

1083
00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.211
<v Speaker 5>on the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then just wow some short distance </v>

1084
00:49:00.211 --> 00:49:02.881
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you dropped to a certain elevation </v>

1085
00:49:02.881 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolute may have been under water,</v>

1086
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 5>I believe before.</v>

1087
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:05.160
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1088
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the c level kind of went back to it.</v>

1089
00:49:07.261 --> 00:49:12.261
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened in parts of Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The he level just went back to what I </v>

1090
00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:12.261
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1091
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 5>it was the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't just,</v>

1092
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was just like,</v>

1093
00:49:17.261 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like blowing and lightening </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all.</v>

1094
00:49:19.121 --> 00:49:19.680
<v Speaker 5>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1095
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.520
<v Speaker 5>just the ocean come up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take that.</v>

1096
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:26.670
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said parts of Jersey in that those </v>

1097
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:26.670
<v Speaker 5>areas will never be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They may never come back.</v>

1098
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 5>There was areas it just got so wiped </v>
<v Speaker 5>over there to build something out there.</v>

1099
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:33.360
<v Speaker 5>Like the odds that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would stay there and the eyes,</v>

1100
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 5>the water's not going to hit that spot </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

1101
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.080
<v Speaker 5>I was watching some of have footage of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

1102
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.600
<v Speaker 5>that title was in Japan and how they </v>
<v Speaker 5>roll through and it looks like just </v>

1103
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.530
<v Speaker 5>water and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's just water.</v>

1104
00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:47.110
<v Speaker 5>If they take everything like cars and </v>
<v Speaker 5>boats.</v>

1105
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 5>That was something that haunt that </v>
<v Speaker 5>footage from.</v>

1106
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 5>That haunted me for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to get away from that and that in</v>

1107
00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:01.770
<v Speaker 5>historical perspective compared to some </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the events that we know have </v>

1108
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:02.360
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like giant titles.</v>

1109
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:06.070
<v Speaker 5>So they know about that Canary Islands </v>
<v Speaker 5>Shelf.</v>

1110
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Apparently there's like a shelf in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Africa.</v>

1111
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a gigantic volcanic shelf and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it breaks off,</v>

1112
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 5>the fucking water comes at us and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>could go deep in on the east coast.</v>

1113
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.870
<v Speaker 5>Many miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many miles?</v>

1114
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weight,</v>

1115
00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:25.920
<v Speaker 5>because you're talking about essentially</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mountain falling into the ocean and </v>

1116
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 5>this incredible blast of energy which </v>
<v Speaker 5>carries this water,</v>

1117
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 5>this huge tidal wave that starts in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of fucking,</v>

1118
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wherever that is,</v>

1119
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:43.181
<v Speaker 5>the Canary Islands and goes 500 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 5>hour across the ocean and then slams </v>

1120
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:46.720
<v Speaker 5>into 500 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

1121
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 5>You could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean some of the catastrophes,</v>

1122
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 5>but there were so few.</v>

1123
00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't just last civil Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization.</v>

1124
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 5>Whatever sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made it up,</v>

1125
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to.</v>

1126
00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1127
00:50:58.491 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they found many,</v>

1128
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially near Spain,</v>

1129
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:02.400
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many sunken civilization.</v>

1130
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 5>They found the one that they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>calling it Lantis,</v>

1131
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.190
<v Speaker 5>whether or not Atlanta was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical place,</v>

1132
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:12.191
<v Speaker 5>but it's got concentric circles just </v>
<v Speaker 5>like they believe Atlanta still maybe </v>

1133
00:51:12.191 --> 00:51:12.790
<v Speaker 5>inspired by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1134
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 5>not craig total because that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>recorded history.</v>

1135
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.270
<v Speaker 5>What those 1800 explosion never heard on</v>
<v Speaker 5>Earth Day,</v>

1136
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pyro plastic glass that just feel.</v>

1137
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a general consensus.</v>

1138
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:30.581
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they've reached that </v>
<v Speaker 5>conclusion with the Atlantis was asking </v>

1139
00:51:30.581 --> 00:51:32.300
<v Speaker 5>was whether or not I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is troy.</v>

1140
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was real.</v>

1141
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a fascinating.</v>

1142
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:39.730
<v Speaker 5>Like what was troy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Troy and troy was the guy made a bunch </v>

1143
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:45.881
<v Speaker 5>of morning the California gold rush or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something went and kind of like started </v>

1144
00:51:45.881 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 5>mapping out what troy was a German guy.</v>

1145
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Can't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is it like under contention whether </v>

1146
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:50.980
<v Speaker 5>or not that's actually troy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.910
<v Speaker 5>There's this guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know where it's at now.</v>

1148
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:57.911
<v Speaker 5>I just remember in college you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about this and registered by </v>

1149
00:51:57.911 --> 00:52:00.371
<v Speaker 5>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This Guy German had made a bunch of </v>

1150
00:52:00.371 --> 00:52:02.501
<v Speaker 5>money in the California gold rush.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then went to find any little computer </v>

1151
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:07.661
<v Speaker 5>there and went in and spend too much </v>
<v Speaker 5>time trying to locate troy and they </v>

1152
00:52:07.661 --> 00:52:11.111
<v Speaker 5>don't think that it was over Helen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was like a trade war and there's </v>

1153
00:52:11.111 --> 00:52:11.111
<v Speaker 5>some mention of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1154
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.270
<v Speaker 5>some of the integral characters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like not odysseus or,</v>

1155
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some of the agamemnon or some of the</v>

1156
00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:23.891
<v Speaker 5>higher up kings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some like historical allusions </v>

1157
00:52:23.891 --> 00:52:24.050
<v Speaker 5>to who these characters might've been to</v>
<v Speaker 5>got involved in that war,</v>

1158
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.930
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't like the face that </v>
<v Speaker 5>launched a thousand ships.</v>

1159
00:52:26.931 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 5>I think it might have been a trade </v>
<v Speaker 5>dispute,</v>

1160
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 5>but I'm telling you some data stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1161
00:52:30.561 --> 00:52:32.420
<v Speaker 5>because I was in college in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 5>nineties,</v>

1162
00:52:32.421 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 5>mid to late nineties.</v>

1163
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:36.130
<v Speaker 5>So that was what I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you'll find that guys name it.</v>

1164
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.200
<v Speaker 5>So the idea was that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1165
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.870
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1166
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.380
<v Speaker 5>he believed that it wasn't fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He believed that it was,</v>

1167
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:47.620
<v Speaker 5>but he had devoted to him the latter </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of his life to identifying what </v>

1168
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.780
<v Speaker 5>troy would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he had a.</v>

1169
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 5>He had a somewhat accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I learned about this,</v>

1170
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.920
<v Speaker 5>he had a somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had come to a somewhat accepted </v>

1171
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.550
<v Speaker 5>conclusion about what troy was maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the principal characters were </v>

1172
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:07.421
<v Speaker 5>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were in fact like some of the people </v>

1173
00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:10.151
<v Speaker 5>that are discussed in the Odyssey and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Iliad were in fact living people at </v>

1174
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:16.181
<v Speaker 5>that time and they were engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>large and there was a large battle in a </v>

1175
00:53:16.181 --> 00:53:19.931
<v Speaker 5>siege of the city and out of that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>born that legend of the siege of troy in</v>

1176
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:23.760
<v Speaker 5>the story of the Iliad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what's really fascinating about</v>

1177
00:53:23.761 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 5>like ancient Rome and ancient Greece and</v>
<v Speaker 5>these incredible</v>

1178
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 7>structures that they built,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that they just all fell apart.</v>

1179
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 7>Like nothing's going on there now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1180
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:38.451
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess the people live in and having a </v>

1181
00:53:38.451 --> 00:53:40.341
<v Speaker 7>good time living their life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but no one thinks to be greases almost </v>

1182
00:53:40.341 --> 00:53:40.341
<v Speaker 7>bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1183
00:53:40.341 --> 00:53:41.190
<v Speaker 7>Onto your bank.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're fucked.</v>

1184
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:42.750
<v Speaker 7>And Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1185
00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 7>Italy is just kind of hanging out in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Europe,</v>

1186
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 7>but if you stop and think about what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1187
00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.400
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the insane society they had at one point</v>

1188
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:55.401
<v Speaker 7>in time where no one anywhere else in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the world at anything comparable people </v>

1189
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.140
<v Speaker 7>fucking people that don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And people have written</v>

1190
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:03.130
<v Speaker 6>books and certainly articles about how </v>
<v Speaker 6>Greece has never,</v>

1191
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.490
<v Speaker 6>hasn't produced a whole lot of artistic </v>
<v Speaker 6>expression.</v>

1192
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 6>That's world class artistic expression </v>
<v Speaker 6>for three 3,500</v>

1193
00:54:12.071 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 6>years or whatever of our long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mainly because,</v>

1194
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you had some examples are examples,</v>

1195
00:54:18.791 --> 00:54:22.240
<v Speaker 6>but mainly because they have that legacy</v>
<v Speaker 6>looming over them.</v>

1196
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 6>You got to Athens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Acropolis is right there looking </v>

1197
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 6>over the city and humbles you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It humbles you.</v>

1198
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.960
<v Speaker 6>The idea of why would I do anything when</v>
<v Speaker 6>I come from,</v>

1199
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 6>when it's already been done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of the idea is looking at us now </v>

1200
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.360
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was at home with really shitty books</v>

1201
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:47.930
<v Speaker 6>that I was trying to write a script and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I read faulkner and I was like,</v>

1202
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.880
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck do I have to say about </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything?</v>

1203
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.180
<v Speaker 6>They the great genius.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm reading his imagery and stuff.</v>

1204
00:54:55.181 --> 00:54:56.170
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

1205
00:54:56.171 --> 00:54:58.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the craziest.</v>

1206
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.980
<v Speaker 6>He was such a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unbelievable writer.</v>

1207
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
<v Speaker 6>Like on every level either beat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>beat you down or.</v>

1208
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I was like,</v>

1209
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:08.950
<v Speaker 6>but what do I have to add to the Canon </v>
<v Speaker 6>of literature?</v>

1210
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.420
<v Speaker 6>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey Bri,</v>

1211
00:55:10.421 --> 00:55:12.310
<v Speaker 6>you're going to run a fucking screenplay</v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

1212
00:55:12.311 --> 00:55:13.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you got to keep doing it.</v>

1213
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.660
<v Speaker 6>You just can't think like that.</v>

1214
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.090
<v Speaker 7>Getting be inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to be inspired.</v>

1215
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.930
<v Speaker 7>That can be very self defeating,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but people do think like that.</v>

1216
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.570
<v Speaker 7>They fuck themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a trick.</v>

1217
00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:25.770
<v Speaker 7>You got to just go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're.</v>

1218
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:27.750
<v Speaker 7>If you do the work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have something to say,</v>

1219
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean your experience,</v>

1220
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone said to me,</v>

1221
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:30.840
<v Speaker 7>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1222
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:31.350
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>

1223
00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 7>I'll never be well off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

1224
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:35.610
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is terrible?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can even say that.</v>

1225
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 7>How can those words even come out of </v>
<v Speaker 7>your mouth?</v>

1226
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 7>I'll never be well off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>

1227
00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 7>You tap,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're done.</v>

1228
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:41.350
<v Speaker 7>Just gonna like the</v>

1229
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.800
<v Speaker 6>coast from they've been to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've allowed other people to define </v>

1230
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.701
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lot of times that's how you define </v>

1231
00:55:49.701 --> 00:55:49.701
<v Speaker 6>yourself and you hold onto that </v>
<v Speaker 6>definition.</v>

1232
00:55:49.701 --> 00:55:52.980
<v Speaker 6>Those lines become very strong because </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to step over them is too scary.</v>

1233
00:55:52.981 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 6>It's you've been disappointed too many </v>
<v Speaker 6>times and you've given up,</v>

1234
00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 6>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all false belief system.</v>

1235
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's how much energy do you have?</v>

1236
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 6>How many did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have enough energy to really pursue.</v>

1237
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:04.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but energy,</v>

1238
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:09.321
<v Speaker 6>I transfer energy to being something </v>
<v Speaker 6>called inspiration you may have or you </v>

1239
00:56:09.321 --> 00:56:13.401
<v Speaker 6>have no energy unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless somebody provides you with a </v>

1240
00:56:13.401 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 6>blueprint or the inspiration to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1241
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:16.740
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things they say is that,</v>

1242
00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.470
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

1243
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.580
<v Speaker 6>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>

1244
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1245
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:24.880
<v Speaker 6>you can motivate yourself by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by defining on what you're going to lose</v>

1246
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 6>as opposed to what you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

1247
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 6>we're really good at dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

1248
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:30.180
<v Speaker 6>I didn't get that and then we just come.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they,</v>

1249
00:56:30.181 --> 00:56:32.670
<v Speaker 6>they say that psychologist sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll tell you what do you.</v>

1250
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 6>If you don't do this thing that you want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do,</v>

1251
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.320
<v Speaker 6>what do you actually lose?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you not going to get?</v>

1252
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:40.240
<v Speaker 6>What are you going to lose that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>already have?</v>

1253
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:45.480
<v Speaker 6>And when you start framing somebody in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>motivational incentives that way they </v>

1254
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 6>will tend to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They will tend to work a lot harder</v>

1255
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm always motivated.</v>

1256
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm always motivated by what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna lose as opposed to a man because I</v>

1257
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 5>always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I've carved out an existence that's</v>

1258
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 5>way better than I would imagine out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>carved out,</v>

1259
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like I'm not motivated,</v>

1260
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:11.410
<v Speaker 5>but what I didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always motivated in a way,</v>

1261
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:16.411
<v Speaker 5>but what I did get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I want to do something like I want </v>

1262
00:57:16.411 --> 00:57:18.790
<v Speaker 5>to be spending much time outside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't be able to on a lot.</v>

1263
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 5>And then now it's not that I don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>like I got gypped.</v>

1264
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1265
00:57:22.331 --> 00:57:27.331
<v Speaker 5>I got to hang on to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're not sweet situation to hang </v>

1266
00:57:27.331 --> 00:57:27.600
<v Speaker 5>onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of scary as anything.</v>

1267
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:32.630
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's as scary as striving toward </v>

1268
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.630
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>

1269
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.630
<v Speaker 5>Well I did</v>

1270
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 6>to realize that like I went and bought </v>
<v Speaker 6>some mats and I,</v>

1271
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:38.150
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm enrolling with my buddy and my </v>

1272
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.150
<v Speaker 6>garage and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why didn't you.</v>

1273
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.150
<v Speaker 5>That's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1274
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.180
<v Speaker 5>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you don't want to lose.</v>

1275
00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to gain my black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1276
00:57:40.231 --> 00:57:43.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to lose.</v>

1277
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to feel like I lose my </v>
<v Speaker 5>manhood and I think that's what I'm kind</v>

1278
00:57:46.821 --> 00:57:48.690
<v Speaker 5>of working through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eight.</v>

1279
00:57:48.691 --> 00:57:50.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe I'm holding onto something</v>

1280
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:55.670
<v Speaker 5>something and I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm doing in my garage for an hour </v>

1281
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:57.900
<v Speaker 5>like I did the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm trying not to lose something</v>

1282
00:57:57.901 --> 00:57:59.370
<v Speaker 5>as opposed to gaining something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

1283
00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:00.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we're just.</v>

1284
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm kind of playing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a great.</v>

1285
00:58:02.371 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad I came just for that little bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>of insight about like,</v>

1286
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:10.490
<v Speaker 5>you know how to have bill loser losers </v>
<v Speaker 5>by the prospect of lost rather than </v>

1287
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:15.150
<v Speaker 5>motivated by the prospect of loss rather</v>
<v Speaker 5>than motivated by what you might get.</v>

1288

<v Speaker 5>this guy apparently I might have got </v>
<v Speaker 5>this wrong,</v>

1369
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.780
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think I did last week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were talking about too weird.</v>

1370
01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Nine slash 11 calls that came in and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy called nine one one because it's a </v>

1371
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 5>hamster had had babies.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1377
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:02.780
<v Speaker 5>Your theory about why big foot can exist</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he has.</v>

1378
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.930
<v Speaker 5>He has no hair on his top of his feet </v>
<v Speaker 5>and his hands.</v>

1379
01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.790
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's someone else.</v>

1380
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:10.760
<v Speaker 5>Mine is just that he can't exist because</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would have.</v>

1381
01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:13.000
<v Speaker 5>There would be dead ones laying around </v>
<v Speaker 5>known.</v>

1382
01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.680
<v Speaker 5>Then like every other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how many times have you ever seen</v>

1383
01:02:15.681 --> 01:02:17.450
<v Speaker 5>like a dead mountain lion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen him?</v>

1384
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Like just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1385
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean not ones you shot.</v>

1386
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:25.220
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have you ever run across one that you </v>

1387
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:25.220
<v Speaker 7>found that it just died of natural </v>
<v Speaker 7>causes or.</v>

1388
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to lie to you and say that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have found lions died of natural causes,</v>

1389
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 3>but I have not found natural causes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1390
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1391
01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.720
<v Speaker 7>I've seen them in the wild three times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Three times.</v>

1392
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.350
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

1393
01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:41.351
<v Speaker 7>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have any chips in the sasquatch </v>

1394
01:02:41.351 --> 01:02:45.671
<v Speaker 7>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but Jane Goodall says that she believes </v>

1395
01:02:45.671 --> 01:02:45.770
<v Speaker 7>that it exists and that's fascinating to</v>
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>

1396
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.800
<v Speaker 7>She didn't say was that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>species we and she thinks it's a </v>

1397
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:50.800
<v Speaker 7>gigantic pool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What about those ones?</v>

1398
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.451
<v Speaker 7>So what more do we know about those ones</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the Congo that are totally different </v>

1399
01:02:55.451 --> 01:02:55.451
<v Speaker 7>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>chimps?</v>

1400
01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:00.820
<v Speaker 7>Jane Goodall believes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm pretty sure is that it's a gigantic </v>

1401
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.260
<v Speaker 7>pythagoras,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which was a real animal existed in Asia.</v>

1402
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:05.660
<v Speaker 7>The most recent example of it was </v>
<v Speaker 7>100,000</v>

1403
01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:09.200
<v Speaker 7>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the idea is that we think is extinct,</v>

1404
01:03:09.201 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 7>but it might not have been because we </v>
<v Speaker 7>know it coexisted with people.</v>

1405
01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:15.080
<v Speaker 7>And really it wasn't discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think until the 19 twenties who's,</v>

1406
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.260
<v Speaker 7>I think it was discovered some somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 7>in early 19 hundreds.</v>

1407
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:23.350
<v Speaker 7>There was a guy who came into apothecary</v>
<v Speaker 7>shop where they would sell like a </v>

1408
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:25.280
<v Speaker 7>fucking home remedies and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ground goat,</v>

1409
01:03:25.281 --> 01:03:30.281
<v Speaker 7>Dick and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Chinese places are really into that and </v>

1410
01:03:30.281 --> 01:03:31.640
<v Speaker 7>they had this giant primate tooth and </v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy examined it.</v>

1411
01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:31.940
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1412
01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.800
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1413
01:03:33.801 --> 01:03:36.770
<v Speaker 7>it turned out it was a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 7>species and nobody ever heard of.</v>

1414
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.220
<v Speaker 7>And it's an eight foot bipedal primate </v>
<v Speaker 7>that buried.</v>

1415
01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 7>It's young are buried.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's dead rather.</v>

1416
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:43.370
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1417
01:03:43.371 --> 01:03:45.440
<v Speaker 7>They believed they stack their dead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1418
01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:50.830
<v Speaker 7>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea that this thing existed </v>

1419
01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:50.830
<v Speaker 7>alongside human beings and it really </v>
<v Speaker 7>did.</v>

1420
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:55.870
<v Speaker 7>I love how they can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how they can like take a piece of bone </v>

1421
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:56.560
<v Speaker 7>and construct an entire.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But thanks.</v>

1422
01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.100
<v Speaker 3>They often can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1423
01:03:58.101 --> 01:03:59.360
<v Speaker 3>you can tell a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot.</v>

1424
01:03:59.361 --> 01:04:01.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean like as in I don't criticize </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1425
01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:04.190
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people get off on looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at mistakes,</v>

1426
01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that scientists have made like,</v>

1427
01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:07.630
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought this.</v>

1428
01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 3>And other times it's like they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put together a cohesive narrative and</v>

1429
01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.360
<v Speaker 3>it's in the scientific process is always</v>
<v Speaker 3>inviting people to add on and make </v>

1430
01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.631
<v Speaker 3>corrections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some people are fixed on this idea </v>

1431
01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:21.631
<v Speaker 3>that if you can't get everything exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>right the first time,</v>

1432
01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:24.040
<v Speaker 3>you have no business even dabbling in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

1433
01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.340
<v Speaker 3>when people have made mistakes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about like lineages,</v>

1434
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not down on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like glorifying the mistakes to </v>

1435
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:32.400
<v Speaker 3>point out that it's all few tile and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1436
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.600
<v Speaker 3>it's all bs but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they make mistakes.</v>

1437
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Mistakes are made and I think you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to continue chipping away at it and can </v>

1438
01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:41.240
<v Speaker 3>you try to add to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1439
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:45.850
<v Speaker 3>but the big foot thing of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>species that we have,</v>

1440
01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:48.790
<v Speaker 3>the endangered species that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about North America,</v>

1441
01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:51.550
<v Speaker 3>the ones that have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we knew we had and they went away,</v>

1442
01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 3>went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in some of the ones that we knew </v>

1443
01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.671
<v Speaker 3>were hanging on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still have a big problem with </v>

1444
01:04:59.671 --> 01:04:59.671
<v Speaker 3>mortality on those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we find them.</v>

1445
01:04:59.671 --> 01:05:02.530
<v Speaker 3>You have very few Florida panthers every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year they're getting hit on the highway.</v>

1446
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.030
<v Speaker 7>Thank God.</v>

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Look at the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this ad is a fucking polar bear </v>

1493

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so see,</v>

1494
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:59.280

<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1495
01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a young poet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's big enough dude.</v>

1496
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Then they're little babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will fuck you up.</v>

1497
01:07:04.051 --> 01:07:09.051
<v Speaker 1>That shit got jacked and look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's getting up and her pants are all </v>

1498
01:07:09.051 --> 01:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Run girl run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1500
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I think she's really hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary ass.</v>

1501
01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1502
01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.860
<v Speaker 5>that thing just took a couple of nips in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a village.</v>

1503
01:07:18.861 --> 01:07:20.840
<v Speaker 5>Just came into a village,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1504
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't fuck around there.</v>

1505
01:07:22.971 --> 01:07:24.980
<v Speaker 5>They eat everything that moves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's polar.</v>

1506
01:07:24.981 --> 01:07:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Bears are way scarier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1507
01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.280
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That hybrid.</v>

1508
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 5>The hybrid between the polar keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>turning up.</v>

1509
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.720
<v Speaker 5>I got shot one now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1510
01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of them now though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1511
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:37.490
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know they know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1512
01:07:37.491 --> 01:07:38.550
<v Speaker 5>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a.</v>

1513
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.800
<v Speaker 5>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not viable.</v>

1514
01:07:39.801 --> 01:07:41.060
<v Speaker 5>They're not sexually violent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1515
01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:43.580
<v Speaker 5>So this is a global warming thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what's going on?</v>

1516
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:49.140
<v Speaker 5>I know that that the theory I'm familiar</v>
<v Speaker 5>with is people suggested it might begin </v>

1517
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:54.670
<v Speaker 5>to happen more as you lose as the polar </v>
<v Speaker 5>ice cap recedes and polar bears aren't </v>

1518
01:07:57.261 --> 01:08:01.060
<v Speaker 5>able to spend as much time out on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>CIS that they'll be coming inland.</v>

1519
01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:02.510
<v Speaker 5>More so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's been.</v>

1520
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:08.230
<v Speaker 5>My understanding again is there's been </v>
<v Speaker 5>an increase in the distance inland that </v>

1521
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.611
<v Speaker 5>people have been encountering some bears</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a greater likelihood of </v>

1522
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:16.181
<v Speaker 5>bringing polar bears into what would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditionally like interior grizzly and </v>

1523
01:08:16.181 --> 01:08:16.181
<v Speaker 5>saw</v>

1524
01:08:16.181 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 3>some hybrids have turned up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

1525
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:25.270
<v Speaker 3>They're not viable and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone knows like in a bulletproof way </v>

1526
01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 3>that this wasn't happening before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's happening now.</v>

1527
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:29.100
<v Speaker 3>But I think just in a logical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if bear,</v>

1528
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 3>if there's not going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>availability of sea ice,</v>

1529
01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:37.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bears are going to spend more time on </v>

1530
01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:37.520
<v Speaker 3>ground which is going to bring them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>

1531
01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when grizzly bears are out of </v>

1532
01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.471
<v Speaker 3>hibernation in the spring is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring them into more contact so that as </v>

1533
01:08:44.471 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a guy,</v>

1534
01:08:45.111 --> 01:08:46.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy not know.</v>

1535
01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:49.220
<v Speaker 3>It was a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shot one,</v>

1536
01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:51.970
<v Speaker 3>and it was legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew it was weird when he shot it and</v>

1537
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.160
<v Speaker 3>took it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a native guy that gives it a shot</v>

1538
01:08:55.161 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 3>and it was checked out and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

1539
01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 3>What I want to know when we go hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Alaska,</v>

1540
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 3>I'll be calling anywhere where there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>hybrid,</v>

1541
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:04.780
<v Speaker 3>barest because I will come with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>arsenal,</v>

1542
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.800
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that you can really make </v>

1543
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.711
<v Speaker 3>the case that hybrid bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that there's a case we </v>

1544
01:09:11.711 --> 01:09:11.720
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hybrid bears are more dangerous than</v>

1545
01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:12.200
<v Speaker 3>900.</v>

1546
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since you can't make the case.</v>

1547
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about I make the case at all?</v>

1548
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Bears are fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about,</v>

1549
01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:21.260
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you like?</v>

1550
01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because he's only a grizzly.</v>

1551
01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Fucking look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1552
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Cold and fairs week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silly Bitch.</v>

1553
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave some honey and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just go to that.</v>

1554
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll use if we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we go up there would probably be </v>

1555
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>

1556
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we go to an area like a black,</v>

1557
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:41.891
<v Speaker 3>like just category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't worry about you don't worry </v>

1558
01:09:41.891 --> 01:09:42.140
<v Speaker 3>about black students generally don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>worry about black bears,</v>

1559
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:47.590
<v Speaker 3>but if you go to go to an area that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixed populations where you have an </v>

1560
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:49.260
<v Speaker 3>interior areas that you might be wanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>black robes with,</v>

1561
01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 3>grizzly bears around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deftly got paid more attention to.</v>

1562
01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1563
01:09:54.111 --> 01:09:55.460
<v Speaker 3>but when you got to pay more attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a,</v>

1564
01:09:55.461 --> 01:09:59.940
<v Speaker 3>mainly you owe it to the area and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>owe it to the animals to,</v>

1565
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.310
<v Speaker 3>to pay attention to it because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just have negligence and just.</v>

1566
01:10:04.311 --> 01:10:06.670
<v Speaker 3>And it leads to a conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1567
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:11.710
<v Speaker 3>and you need to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to look out for them all the </v>

1568
01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:12.710
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Be aware,</v>

1569
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 3>don't do stupid things in your camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't invite disaster,</v>

1570
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 3>which has food.</v>

1571
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.680
<v Speaker 3>Just being clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keeping,</v>

1572
01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.380
<v Speaker 3>keeping like being cognizant of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>threats are.</v>

1573
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say where it's either.</v>

1574
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dark.</v>

1575
01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:26.150
<v Speaker 3>We're cooking meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1576
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which we did last time.</v>

1577
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be inviting bears in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1578
01:10:31.011 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

1579
01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:33.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal,</v>

1580
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:38.310
<v Speaker 3>those kind of strike a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could live like this really </v>

1581
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:41.201
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know some people we call them </v>

1582
01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:41.201
<v Speaker 3>being bare annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1583
01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:44.590
<v Speaker 3>I'd also bear annoyed guys who like </v>
<v Speaker 3>their whole experience in the woods </v>

1584
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:49.510
<v Speaker 3>becomes tainted by their fear of bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know they'll only like,</v>

1585
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:54.140
<v Speaker 3>they'll go off in some other place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of yards away and eat food that</v>

1586
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:56.790
<v Speaker 3>they imagine would be unappealing to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear and,</v>

1587
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.360
<v Speaker 3>and do all this kind of crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1588
01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got there,</v>

1589
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.320
<v Speaker 3>they brushed her teeth off in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different area and hang her toothbrush </v>

1590
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.931
<v Speaker 3>out in a tree because it might smell a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing or they don't go out in the woods </v>

1591
01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:08.210
<v Speaker 3>if their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if their wives menstruating,</v>

1592
01:11:08.211 --> 01:11:13.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to go out in the woods </v>

1593
01:11:13.211 --> 01:11:13.211
<v Speaker 3>with her and you're going to go crazy.</v>

1594
01:11:13.211 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Or you can be like crazy in the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme and just like,</v>

1595
01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drag kill an animal and drag it back to </v>

1596
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.261
<v Speaker 3>camp and garden and leave the gut plain </v>
<v Speaker 3>air for five days to ripen in the sun </v>

1597
01:11:24.261 --> 01:11:27.531
<v Speaker 3>next to your tent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which would be like the other kind of </v>

1598
01:11:27.531 --> 01:11:30.620
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous or you can kind of walk a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate line and if you can do things </v>

1599
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:35.451
<v Speaker 3>without tainting your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just like little common sense </v>

1600
01:11:35.451 --> 01:11:38.370
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not camping right on top of carcasses.</v>

1601
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.580
<v Speaker 3>If you're cooking smelly food like fish </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fish,</v>

1602
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:46.581
<v Speaker 3>guts and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be careful about getting rid of that </v>

1603
01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:46.581
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put in your food up in a tree.</v>

1604
01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:48.780
<v Speaker 3>If there's trees available,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there aren't things,</v>

1605
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:51.900
<v Speaker 3>then you put your food somewhere where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see it and monitor it.</v>

1606
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Lay sweaty clothes on top of it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhance the human odor in the area.</v>

1607
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean just little things you can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't ruin your time,</v>

1608
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:02.880
<v Speaker 3>but you're generally trying to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>decrease the chance that you're going to</v>

1609
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:04.800
<v Speaker 3>have a conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to have to get the government</v>

1610
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:09.801
<v Speaker 3>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come out and have to </v>

1611
01:12:09.801 --> 01:12:10.800
<v Speaker 3>kill some bear because he so grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they smell humans tend to avoid him</v>

1612
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1613
01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even the ones,</v>

1614
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.310
<v Speaker 3>even the ones that don't have experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>with humans.</v>

1615
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:23.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you go on a really remote area </v>

1616
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.030
<v Speaker 3>where you run into barriers to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run into like a two year old bear,</v>

1617
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:27.990
<v Speaker 3>three year old bear and it's reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>to assume he has not had a direct </v>

1618
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:32.320
<v Speaker 3>interaction with a human and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly he just hasn't.</v>

1619
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.640
<v Speaker 3>His parents who is his mother could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>12 years old and she's had a handful </v>

1620
01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.760
<v Speaker 3>throughout 12 year life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other one might not.</v>

1621
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 3>But when they smell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes it's just,</v>

1622
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 3>it's new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hits them unlike a d,</v>

1623
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:48.770
<v Speaker 3>they just smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they got the world divided into </v>

1624
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:48.900
<v Speaker 3>smells good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't smell good.</v>

1625
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that some human smells kind </v>

1626
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:53.960
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that smell.</v>

1627
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.440
<v Speaker 3>It was like a behavior posh and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about uh,</v>

1628
01:12:56.441 --> 01:13:01.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did on the show were had to run a </v>

1629
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:04.521
<v Speaker 3>bear out of camp and just come and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bear and trying to look big and </v>

1630
01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:09.480
<v Speaker 3>pissed off and like unyielding speaks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bear.</v>

1631
01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1632
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.050
<v Speaker 5>well there is a person and he's likely </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be armed.</v>

1633
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.080
<v Speaker 5>He's just thinking whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That thing is pissed off and coming at </v>

1634
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:17.120
<v Speaker 5>me for the folks who don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about,</v>

1635
01:13:17.121 --> 01:13:22.121
<v Speaker 5>the Tim Ferriss episode of a mediator is</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they went terrible hunting in </v>

1636
01:13:22.121 --> 01:13:26.531
<v Speaker 5>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you were looking for the one to </v>

1637
01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:29.021
<v Speaker 5>watch on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the one I'm looking for this </v>

1638
01:13:29.021 --> 01:13:30.340
<v Speaker 5>particular situation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but these were big bear sister.</v>

1639
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.490
<v Speaker 5>There was one you saw and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>even bigger one that was running towards</v>

1640
01:13:34.491 --> 01:13:39.491
<v Speaker 5>the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people are more afraid of the </v>

1641
01:13:39.491 --> 01:13:39.491
<v Speaker 5>little ones really because the little </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones haven't.</v>

1642
01:13:39.491 --> 01:13:42.020
<v Speaker 5>They haven't accumulated that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A set of experiences.</v>

1643
01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:43.220
<v Speaker 5>The teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1644
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.430
<v Speaker 5>what's good and what's bad?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know about.</v>

1645
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.510
<v Speaker 5>Just think about like adolescents,</v>

1646
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:47.500
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1647
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:51.680
<v Speaker 3>if you think about if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get in like a road rage incident in some</v>

1648
01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:56.681
<v Speaker 3>ways a road rage incident with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's 50 isn't quite as dangerous as it</v>

1649
01:13:58.031 --> 01:14:00.530
<v Speaker 3>might be with a guy that's 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the guy that's 18.</v>

1650
01:14:00.531 --> 01:14:05.531
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still might be like sorting through </v>

1651
01:14:05.531 --> 01:14:05.531
<v Speaker 3>some stuff.</v>

1652
01:14:05.531 --> 01:14:05.540
<v Speaker 5>Willing to like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not aware of how long like driving </v>

1654
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.830
<v Speaker 5>cars and I think that</v>

1655
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.070
<v Speaker 3>so some people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are guys that know,</v>

1656
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:16.060
<v Speaker 3>some of you guys know so much more about</v>
<v Speaker 3>bears now do,</v>

1657
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 3>but but people that know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like look,</v>

1658
01:14:17.651 --> 01:14:22.651
<v Speaker 3>particularly the particularly dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears the bears have to watch out for </v>

1659
01:14:22.651 --> 01:14:26.490
<v Speaker 3>are the ones that have been recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked out by the mother and the males </v>

1660
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:30.670
<v Speaker 3>will will get kicked out and tend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go farther afield to find a home</v>

1661
01:14:30.671 --> 01:14:35.671
<v Speaker 3>range everywhere they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting beaten up by a resident </v>

1662
01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:35.800
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

1663
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.120
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a good lock on available</v>
<v Speaker 3>food resources yet is very likely that </v>

1664
01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 3>they're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're inexperienced,</v>

1665
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 3>they're pressured and when you encounter</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1666
01:14:46.241 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 3>those are the ones that people watch out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

1667
01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:51.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a theory about black bears as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1668
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:56.580
<v Speaker 3>but I think that those blackberries are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more likely to end up like in some tree </v>

1669
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.090
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of a town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young displays ones.</v>

1670
01:14:58.090 --> 01:14:59.710
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like generally,</v>

1671
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.650
<v Speaker 3>and you can cite examples of things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

1672
01:15:01.651 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 3>like generally like blackbirds are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1673
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:08.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it as a dangerous bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think of blackbirds been any </v>

1674
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:08.700
<v Speaker 3>more dangerous than deer being </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

1675
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not bothered by blackberry is a</v>

1676
01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 3>crazy video or recently from somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Canada where these dudes are treat </v>

1677
01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 3>their in tree stands and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing there and the bear for whatever</v>

1678
01:15:19.331 --> 01:15:24.331
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just runs up the tree and is beside him </v>

1679
01:15:24.331 --> 01:15:26.720
<v Speaker 3>in the trailer man in like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds and he's like,</v>

1680
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 3>they're talking to each other in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>filming this.</v>

1681
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.080
<v Speaker 3>The bear price smelled something like my</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad's buddy got as much as I just said.</v>

1682
01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:38.980
<v Speaker 3>My Dad's buddy got mauled because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting bears from a tree and a sow with</v>

1683
01:15:38.981 --> 01:15:42.510
<v Speaker 3>cubs came in and he didn't want to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>the south cubs.</v>

1684
01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most places you can't,</v>

1685
01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.670
<v Speaker 3>but that sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smelled something.</v>

1686
01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:51.170
<v Speaker 3>She smelled a person and her response </v>
<v Speaker 3>was to shoot her cubs up the tree to </v>

1687
01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:54.400
<v Speaker 3>safety and she shoot him up his tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they came past them on history,</v>

1688
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:59.260
<v Speaker 3>they started squealing and then she came</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and mold his lower legs.</v>

1689
01:15:59.261 --> 01:16:04.261
<v Speaker 3>I remember her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember one night we're sitting in </v>

1690
01:16:04.261 --> 01:16:04.261
<v Speaker 3>our house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad got a phone call guy used to hunt</v>

1691
01:16:04.261 --> 01:16:07.801
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had gotten his lower legs mauled by a </v>

1692
01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:07.801
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he eventually founded her off,</v>

1693
01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:10.160
<v Speaker 3>was trying to fend her off of the Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you call this bench.</v>

1694
01:16:10.161 --> 01:16:12.160
<v Speaker 3>She came back down the tree and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd let him be.</v>

1695
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1696
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:15.640
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are incidents,</v>

1697
01:16:15.641 --> 01:16:18.070
<v Speaker 3>but you can also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're just cruising youtube,</v>

1698
01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's plenty of places where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go find a deer,</v>

1699
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.630
<v Speaker 3>knock the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone to look at his spirit.</v>

1700
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:25.980
<v Speaker 3>He's climbing a ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1701
01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not a big bear though,</v>

1702
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 8>because look at it two years.</v>

1703
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.160
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the best thing to do?</v>

1704
01:16:34.161 --> 01:16:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Just talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

1705
01:16:35.481 --> 01:16:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Bear ran away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's big enough.</v>

1706
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't like the,</v>

1707
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 3>the accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well see,</v>

1708
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:45.290
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some people say that,</v>

1709
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:48.450
<v Speaker 3>but again this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1710
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:53.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at like when people own </v>

1711
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.550
<v Speaker 3>bears actually tagged people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so.</v>

1712
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:55.610
<v Speaker 3>It's oftentimes just like weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances are unpredictable things,</v>

1713
01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 3>but the general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the general thinking it the general </v>

1714
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.490
<v Speaker 3>wisdom on if a blank bird does attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1715
01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:03.800
<v Speaker 3>it's predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1716
01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.440
<v Speaker 3>He's not defending territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a blackberry tanks where he's like,</v>

1717
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat that was thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you fight hell to fight like hell riced.</v>

1718
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:17.470
<v Speaker 3>If a sal grizzy with cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you spook it into attacks you.</v>

1719
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.850
<v Speaker 3>What it's doing is neutralizing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>

1720
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:23.720
<v Speaker 3>So then the thinking is play dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get covered.</v>

1721
01:17:23.721 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 3>You know [inaudible] right.</v>

1722
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Here's where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's where they're going to kill you.</v>

1723
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:29.180
<v Speaker 3>You cover this and curl up and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

1724
01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take that bastard and walks off,</v>

1725
01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1726
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:35.240
<v Speaker 3>align,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've aligned was to hit you.</v>

1727
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:40.540
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to just go ballistic on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because it's a predatory response </v>

1728
01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.300
<v Speaker 3>that it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when black bears,</v>

1729
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:46.301
<v Speaker 3>like when you do hear of black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they attack the attack kids and </v>

1730
01:17:46.301 --> 01:17:51.251
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lions often attack like small women </v>

1731
01:17:51.251 --> 01:17:53.411
<v Speaker 3>joggers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like small women joggers seem to get </v>

1732
01:17:53.411 --> 01:17:53.411
<v Speaker 3>attacked by lions or young kids need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get attacked by lions.</v>

1733
01:17:53.411 --> 01:17:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's at that thing is like,</v>

1734
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1735
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then grizzlies enough people to man,</v>

1736
01:17:58.321 --> 01:17:59.780
<v Speaker 3>like you hear about people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1737
01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get at by bears.</v>

1738
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy recently,</v>

1739
01:18:02.841 --> 01:18:04.610
<v Speaker 3>they think it was a hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

1740
01:18:04.611 --> 01:18:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy who was</v>

1741
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:09.310
<v Speaker 7>minor and he went into get groceries in </v>
<v Speaker 7>town.</v>

1742
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.890
<v Speaker 7>Apparently his boat died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His engine dies.</v>

1743
01:18:11.891 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 7>So he pulled over and that's where they </v>
<v Speaker 7>found his body.</v>

1744
01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:18.710
<v Speaker 3>It had been mostly consumed.</v>

1745
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:24.510
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they think they think that might've </v>

1746
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:24.510
<v Speaker 7>been a hybrid.</v>

1747
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:24.610
<v Speaker 3>You know what's weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading,</v>

1748
01:18:24.611 --> 01:18:29.611
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this book by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this bear hunting book by </v>

1749
01:18:29.611 --> 01:18:29.611
<v Speaker 3>this writer Tony Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1750
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:33.460
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on Kodiak island,</v>

1751
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:38.470
<v Speaker 3>like in the last couple of insulin areas</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just have really dense grizzly </v>

1752
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.470
<v Speaker 3>populations are brown bear grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing.</v>

1753
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Just people generally say like brown </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear for Coastal Grizzlies,</v>

1754
01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.030
<v Speaker 3>grizzlies free anterior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1755
01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:48.630
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that the grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the male grizzlies will come out </v>

1756
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.200
<v Speaker 3>and when they come out in those areas </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have,</v>

1757
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll may have like a grizzly for </v>

1758
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:55.230
<v Speaker 3>every one or two or three square miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot,</v>

1759
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.160
<v Speaker 3>a lot more dense than most other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll come out and they,</v>

1760
01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.990
<v Speaker 3>when they come out in the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're heart and copes.</v>

1761
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

1762
01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:05.970
<v Speaker 3>that's what's on the menu man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's like there's so many of them </v>

1763
01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:10.040
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so vicious that they come out </v>

1764
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.570
<v Speaker 3>and like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their primary food source for somebody </v>

1765
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:13.990
<v Speaker 3>mature boars is grizzly cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1766
01:19:13.991 --> 01:19:15.850
<v Speaker 3>And you go after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he said a weird thing is,</v>

1767
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:20.910
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll kill those companies that we </v>

1768
01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:22.471
<v Speaker 3>said in all of his hunting when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they'll kill a grizzly bear brown </v>

1769
01:19:22.471 --> 01:19:23.330
<v Speaker 3>bear and skin it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1770
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:25.600
<v Speaker 3>he said all these hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talked to other guys too.</v>

1771
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:31.080
<v Speaker 3>He's never seen a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's never seen where brown bear </v>

1772
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.210
<v Speaker 3>consumed the skin dot carcass up another</v>
<v Speaker 3>browser.</v>

1773
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.540
<v Speaker 3>So the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they never read the bear.</v>

1774
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.310
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he mentions in his book,</v>

1775
01:19:39.311 --> 01:19:41.200
<v Speaker 3>he talks to some other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about some Galligan,</v>

1776
01:19:41.230 --> 01:19:42.220
<v Speaker 3>20 years of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1777
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:45.760
<v Speaker 3>if they've never seen the carcass of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult get cannibalized.</v>

1778
01:19:46.150 --> 01:19:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they'll,</v>

1779
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:51.550
<v Speaker 3>they'll put down and it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a active pray for them.</v>

1780
01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:56.730
<v Speaker 7>So when they're hunting the cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you think that it's a response to </v>

1781
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 7>like controlling the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not letting any new members in?</v>

1782
01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it really is food,</v>

1783
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's also that they know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1784
01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.990
<v Speaker 3>that will go back into estrous because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

1785
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:09.000
<v Speaker 3>she's only gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's only going to put off.</v>

1786
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 3>She's only going to put off cuff maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>every few years.</v>

1787
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Tyra dolphins do that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dolphins,</v>

1788
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:19.311
<v Speaker 3>murder babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they know that the woman she won't </v>

1789
01:20:19.311 --> 01:20:19.311
<v Speaker 3>meet with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1790
01:20:19.311 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 3>with the dolphins that blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blue whale drown.</v>

1791
01:20:23.701 --> 01:20:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1792
01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:27.990
<v Speaker 3>they'll drown a female's calf because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she knows she'll bring it again,</v>

1793
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.400
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not brief for years.</v>

1794
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:35.630
<v Speaker 3>It's rough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that really try </v>

1795
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.630
<v Speaker 3>to like dress up the animal world as </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>

1796
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:36.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent this.</v>

1797
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:38.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some wicked stuff out there,</v>

1798
01:20:38.971 --> 01:20:40.410
<v Speaker 3>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those big bars,</v>

1799
01:20:40.411 --> 01:20:42.600
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about this dude Tony Rust</v>
<v Speaker 3>on with these big boards.</v>

1800
01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:47.601
<v Speaker 3>They'll go out and dig dens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ and the females will come </v>

1801
01:20:47.601 --> 01:20:51.621
<v Speaker 3>out later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the females being the Danza cubs and </v>

1802
01:20:51.621 --> 01:20:51.621
<v Speaker 3>those boards will go around doing site </v>
<v Speaker 3>visits.</v>

1803
01:20:51.621 --> 01:20:56.180
<v Speaker 3>No dig covered out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you got in and I imagine they're </v>

1804
01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:00.590
<v Speaker 3>probably a little bit indiscriminately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a chance he's going to consume </v>

1805
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:04.371
<v Speaker 3>his own offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's also thinking that all these </v>

1806
01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:05.160
<v Speaker 3>sounds that wouldn't be available to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>for two years,</v>

1807
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 3>three years are going to be available to</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet this June.</v>

1808
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they've seen instances where a female </v>
<v Speaker 3>has fought them off.</v>

<v Speaker 3>could make it worse,</v>

1838
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:25.740
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be uncomfortable with your girlfriend</v>

<v Speaker 3>Being uncomfortable for two people and </v>

1841
01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:33.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that comes with that.</v>

1842
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:39.010
<v Speaker 3>He was a hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you like her because </v>

<v Speaker 3>That fight is unparalleled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

1846
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:48.681
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing power in those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>bars is just like they duked it out for </v>

<v Speaker 3>the folks who don't know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about are these two bears.</v>

01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:57.810
<v Speaker 3>It's fighting over territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth watching.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That movie alone is worth watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly man alone wash those boards go </v>

1852
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not like a common thing to </v>

1853
01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:08.150
<v Speaker 3>see like in that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

1856
01:23:11.441 --> 01:23:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but I got like,</v>

1857
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.660
<v Speaker 3>but like you can hang out in the woods </v>

1859
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.240
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you look at all the things</v>

1860
01:23:20.241 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 3>you've seen out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's startling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how few really weird things.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

<v Speaker 3>spends a little dinky bit of time out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woods and then sees tons of weird </v>

1865

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.100
<v Speaker 3>and some of the things that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy that was in the footage,</v>

1891
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.050
<v Speaker 3>and I'm only going by and on a grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1892
01:24:30.051 --> 01:24:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go and buy whatever I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw on that to our herzog movie.</v>

1893
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Like Lord knows how many things didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it.</v>

1894
01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1895
01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:40.100
<v Speaker 3>He was out there and witnessed some </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing site.</v>

1896
01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:46.081
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what people have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that the Timothy Treadwell's </v>

1898
01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:46.650
<v Speaker 1>footage was all turned into this Werner </v>
<v Speaker 1>Herzog documentary,</v>

1899
01:24:46.651 --> 01:24:50.670
<v Speaker 1>but this is just a piece of what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy got when he was living up there,</v>

1900
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of people believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to so powerful.</v>

1901
01:24:57.150 --> 01:25:01.220
<v Speaker 1>The good Greco Greco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good under good control and neck</v>

1902
01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.070
<v Speaker 1>that this guy had suicide by bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the way he went out,</v>

1903
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 1>that he knew that if he was there as </v>
<v Speaker 1>late as he was,</v>

1904
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that the bears that would still be </v>
<v Speaker 1>around would be really desperate.</v>

1905
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>There were older bears on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine one of those things getting old </v>

1906
01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1907
01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Power man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1908
01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:20.750
<v Speaker 1>They're going to town and they use it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real Jujitsu.</v>

1909
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's passing the guard.</v>

1910
01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's filled in the hips.</v>

1911
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy's got a good open garden.</v>

1912
01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1913
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:30.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not unreasonable to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are 800 pound plus animals.</v>

1914
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are enormous.</v>

1915
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to put it in perspective,</v>

1916
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:36.640
<v Speaker 1>but that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

1917
01:25:36.641 --> 01:25:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's inside control right now.</v>

1918
01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:41.950
<v Speaker 1>He just passed the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in full sight control right now and</v>

1919
01:25:41.951 --> 01:25:46.951
<v Speaker 1>he's got the neck and he could deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees to the head if that was allowed </v>

1920
01:25:46.951 --> 01:25:46.951
<v Speaker 1>and bear fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't see like that.</v>

1921
01:25:46.951 --> 01:25:48.380
<v Speaker 1>See that move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that move.</v>

1922
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Reclaimed Guard got down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is natural reclaimed guard.</v>

1923
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:59.250
<v Speaker 1>He reclaimed guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't let him get back to guard </v>

1924
01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:02.461
<v Speaker 1>against this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear is fucking crafty to bear on the </v>

1925
01:26:02.461 --> 01:26:02.461
<v Speaker 1>bottom is doing a real good job </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending himself.</v>

1926
01:26:02.461 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>This for real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the other barrier is bigger.</v>

1927
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>This what's going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the bear fight is how they teach</v>

1928
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you to fight in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real foot on the hips,</v>

1929
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>controlling his body out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting him get all of his weight on top</v>

1930
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:17.591
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shifting your hips so your feet touch </v>

1931
01:26:17.591 --> 01:26:17.591
<v Speaker 1>onto his hip.</v>

1932
01:26:17.591 --> 01:26:20.710
<v Speaker 3>You see the chunks of hair flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's an interesting bit of like </v>

1933
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:20.710
<v Speaker 3>bipedalism in this too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1934
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Like they're pretty adept at another </v>
<v Speaker 3>bank.</v>

1935
01:26:22.150 --> 01:26:23.760
<v Speaker 3>You know they're pretty adept at being </v>
<v Speaker 3>under back</v>

1936
01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1937
01:26:25.251 --> 01:26:27.770
<v Speaker 1>when you see him standing up like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their hind legs,</v>

1938
01:26:27.771 --> 01:26:30.200
<v Speaker 1>that's when you realize how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous they are.</v>

1939
01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at the big chunk of hair missing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his back leg,</v>

1940
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:39.010
<v Speaker 1>an arm drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of the fucking light </v>

1941
01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:39.020
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how big the light.</v>

1942
01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>When his youngest check him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been back down to the younger ones.</v>

1943
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Got Better Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you,</v>

1944
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 1>fight off his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be old and crippled.</v>

1945
01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wore out the big deal,</v>

1946
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 1>the big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got tired of the big one,</v>

1947
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:53.200
<v Speaker 1>had a pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had hold of his face though</v>

1948
01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.960
<v Speaker 3>these are blackberries when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>principles on where my brothers and I </v>

1949
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.040
<v Speaker 3>got a little shack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest bear I've seen out there,</v>

1950
01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.640
<v Speaker 3>and that's famous for big barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest barrier I see now.</v>

1951
01:27:05.641 --> 01:27:08.430
<v Speaker 3>There was a big injured old bear on what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

1952
01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:13.431
<v Speaker 3>but he was just packing leg and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of in the autumn of is in the </v>

1953
01:27:13.431 --> 01:27:13.650
<v Speaker 3>autumn of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1954
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:18.830
<v Speaker 3>so he had been like probably the man and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he probably just kiss his ass </v>

1955
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.830
<v Speaker 3>kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1956
01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:24.020
<v Speaker 3>He's sees guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's done by a salmon stream that </v>

1957
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.330
<v Speaker 3>couldn't really move and you can imagine</v>
<v Speaker 3>now all the people he'd beat up because </v>

1958
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.330
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could be old now.</v>

1959
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:28.230
<v Speaker 3>17 one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>

1960
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:31.980
<v Speaker 3>That's from Duluth to tooth tooth </v>
<v Speaker 3>dentist analysis.</v>

1961
01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:32.760
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could,</v>

1962
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:37.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could have a lot of grudges against </v>

1963
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:40.751
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's kind of down one of the big </v>

1964
01:27:40.751 --> 01:27:40.751
<v Speaker 3>board or one of the cool things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1965
01:27:40.751 --> 01:27:42.340
<v Speaker 1>About the trip that we went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should probably talk about that.</v>

1966
01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.930
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck?</v>

1967
01:27:46.931 --> 01:27:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Pee.</v>

1968
01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Go Pee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you come back we'll uh,</v>

1969
01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:52.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk to you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about hunting and manly shit.</v>

1970
01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allowed to say pee on the show.</v>

1971
01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.870
<v Speaker 1>The show is casual as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't have to worry about saying p.</v>

1972
01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.560
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pal?</v>

1973
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I do this weekend?</v>

1974
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1975
01:28:03.730 --> 01:28:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I just watched the playoffs and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched nate's fight.</v>

1976
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Safford and fought a great fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1977
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It was a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>

1978
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.090
<v Speaker 1>the whole card was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asked me to tell Josh Barnett.</v>

1979
01:28:13.091 --> 01:28:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Got a big win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1980
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1981
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>

1982
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good wood for him because he was sick.</v>

1983
01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:20.620
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1984
01:28:20.650 --> 01:28:22.960
<v Speaker 1>he had like a real tough camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there was a,</v>

1985
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:25.720
<v Speaker 1>like you've got a real bad flu or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a bug,</v>

1986
01:28:25.721 --> 01:28:26.080
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1987
01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:28.300
<v Speaker 1>some kind of a cold and could not shake </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1988
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:33.590
<v Speaker 1>He said he only had a few days of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid hard training during the entire </v>

1989
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.200
<v Speaker 1>camp or certainly like just fucking half</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass it or trying to,</v>

1990
01:28:35.201 --> 01:28:36.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do his bass,</v>

1991
01:28:36.761 --> 01:28:41.761
<v Speaker 1>but try not to get sicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to see like where MMA </v>

1992
01:28:41.761 --> 01:28:43.040
<v Speaker 1>is coming because like if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared for someone's,</v>

1993
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

1994
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.290
<v Speaker 1>and if someone hits you with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't seen before,</v>

1995
01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:52.650
<v Speaker 1>like I was thinking about naked and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught with those leg kicks over number </v>

1996
01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:54.910
<v Speaker 1>eight and 18 million times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think terex happening is a,</v>

1997
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.890
<v Speaker 1>he's a really classical technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>striker and it nate Marquardt,</v>

1998
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 1>although a amazing</v>

1999
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:07.250
<v Speaker 7>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you though the knockout of Tyron </v>

2000
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.250
<v Speaker 7>Woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2001
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:10.191
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that sent that insane dot Kao towards </v>

2002
01:29:10.191 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 7>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think that technically if you look</v>

2003
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 7>at all the best technical fighters in </v>
<v Speaker 7>less,</v>

2004
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:19.761
<v Speaker 7>they're freaks of athleticism unless </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're just much faster than anyone </v>

2005
01:29:19.761 --> 01:29:19.761
<v Speaker 7>else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

2006
01:29:19.761 --> 01:29:24.450
<v Speaker 7>they follow a certain number of rules </v>
<v Speaker 7>when it comes to defending yourself when</v>

2007
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:27.840
<v Speaker 7>it comes to carrying your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When it comes to how you fight.</v>

2008
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:31.770
<v Speaker 7>And I'm one of them is you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 7>respect everyone's techniques.</v>

2009
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:36.830
<v Speaker 7>So you got to respect,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like kicks you gotta check leg kicks </v>

2010
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:37.860
<v Speaker 7>whenever possible and I think the idea </v>
<v Speaker 7>is that,</v>

2011
01:29:37.861 --> 01:29:42.861
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nate was going to eat a few of 'em and </v>

2012
01:29:42.861 --> 01:29:43.770
<v Speaker 7>just tag them with a big punch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That sub strategy that works.</v>

2013
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:46.080
<v Speaker 7>So there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tim Silvia,</v>

2014
01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:49.340
<v Speaker 7>Tim Silvia knocked out Rigo Rodriguez </v>
<v Speaker 7>the same way.</v>

2015
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.990
<v Speaker 7>Rico Rico hit him with a leg kick and he</v>
<v Speaker 7>was planted take,</v>

2016
01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:55.650
<v Speaker 7>he decided he just gonna eat the it and </v>
<v Speaker 7>blast the punch and catch a guy.</v>

2017
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:58.560
<v Speaker 7>So a lot of guys do that and it got like</v>
<v Speaker 7>Marco who's got that kind of power,</v>

2018
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.830
<v Speaker 7>probably banked on that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then somewhere along the line safdie</v>

2019
01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:04.440
<v Speaker 7>and hit them with too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was like,</v>

2020
01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:06.390
<v Speaker 7>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I should have checked those.</v>

2021
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:11.410
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's just a matter of absolutely </v>

2022
01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:11.910
<v Speaker 7>could and he might be able to beat 70 </v>
<v Speaker 7>when they fight again.</v>

2023
01:30:11.911 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

2024
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:15.720
<v Speaker 7>it's when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you're dealing with that level,</v>

2025
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.480
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that high,</v>

2026
01:30:16.481 --> 01:30:20.240
<v Speaker 7>a level of fighting terex happening.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a lot of times what it is is a,</v>

2027
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:25.310
<v Speaker 7>it's also how they match.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Giles is a really good wrestler because </v>

2028
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:28.581
<v Speaker 7>it was time with team quest like he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>really hard to take doing Greco with </v>

2029
01:30:28.581 --> 01:30:28.581
<v Speaker 7>Olympia and it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

2030
01:30:28.581 --> 01:30:31.560
<v Speaker 7>So you saw like when nate was really </v>
<v Speaker 7>struggling to take them down to nate was</v>

2031
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:36.561
<v Speaker 7>forced to stand with them and he was </v>
<v Speaker 7>forced to stand with them and 17 is </v>

2032
01:30:36.561 --> 01:30:40.040
<v Speaker 7>being more conservative and he's being </v>
<v Speaker 7>more tactical until he kept landing </v>

2033
01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.911
<v Speaker 7>those leg kicks and neighbors looking </v>
<v Speaker 7>for the big bombs and Woodley fonts </v>

2034
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:43.911
<v Speaker 7>happening.</v>

2035
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:45.980
<v Speaker 7>He just hit him with those low doubles </v>
<v Speaker 7>and singles wrestle.</v>

2036
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:51.030
<v Speaker 7>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One thing they say when they say that </v>

2037
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:54.380
<v Speaker 7>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Greco guys have a tough time with </v>

2038
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:54.380
<v Speaker 7>freestyle wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2039
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:55.110
<v Speaker 7>Well a lot of people have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 7>with a guy like tyron woodley.</v>

2040
01:30:55.111 --> 01:31:00.111
<v Speaker 7>He's just a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a super strong dude with great </v>

2041
01:31:00.111 --> 01:31:00.640
<v Speaker 7>wrestling fan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2042
01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:02.640
<v Speaker 7>and he's in condition.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Any smart,</v>

2043
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:03.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>anywhere,</v>

2044
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:07.140
<v Speaker 7>trains hard and it's a fucking super </v>
<v Speaker 7>athlete and he can punch the shit out.</v>

2045
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.850
<v Speaker 7>His wrestling's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He gets a hold of you.</v>

2046
01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:09.960
<v Speaker 7>You're going to go on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2047
01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:11.070
<v Speaker 7>it's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 7>strong guy,</v>

2048
01:31:11.071 --> 01:31:13.350
<v Speaker 7>but nate beat him and that was probably </v>
<v Speaker 7>the most sensational.</v>

2049
01:31:13.351 --> 01:31:18.351
<v Speaker 7>They look so to go from that fight where</v>
<v Speaker 7>he looks unbelievably good to this </v>

2050
01:31:18.351 --> 01:31:18.630
<v Speaker 7>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just a little wake up call,</v>

2051
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:23.750
<v Speaker 7>she would just be more,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a little bit more tactical or </v>

2052
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:26.121
<v Speaker 7>conservative when you're fighting guy </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that and to realize that that kind </v>

2053
01:31:26.121 --> 01:31:29.091
<v Speaker 7>of accumulation of eating,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those kind of shots really can pay off </v>

2054
01:31:29.091 --> 01:31:29.091
<v Speaker 7>or can can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2055
01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.020
<v Speaker 7>it tends to maybe nate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

2056
01:31:31.021 --> 01:31:36.021

<v Speaker 7>bigger and stronger so he could call </v>

2057
01:31:36.021 --> 01:31:36.021

2059
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.890
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look after that Woodley fight,</v>

01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2171
01:36:10.061 --> 01:36:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't nice.</v>

2172
01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.980
<v Speaker 1>When you see a guy who's not nice to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees like that,</v>

2173
01:36:14.981 --> 01:36:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to talk to them,</v>

2174
01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:21.530
<v Speaker 1>but the upside is that Ryan has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fuck that.</v>

2175
01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a fun experience,</v>

2176
01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:23.860
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2177
01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:28.861
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have our first hunting trip with you </v>

2178
01:36:28.861 --> 01:36:28.870
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real treat man.</v>

2179
01:36:28.871 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 1>It was so much fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep telling you that.</v>

2180
01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I love seeing it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love seeing people's eyes,</v>

2181
01:36:33.761 --> 01:36:35.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be weird for you.</v>

2182
01:36:35.471 --> 01:36:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2183
01:36:35.951 --> 01:36:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you've spent your entire life </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially hunting.</v>

2184
01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:41.320
<v Speaker 1>You can't even remember the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you killed anything,</v>

2185
01:36:41.321 --> 01:36:41.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2186
01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:42.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2187
01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first day,</v>

2188
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.320
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first deer I killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as hunting small game and </v>

2189
01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:49.320
<v Speaker 3>just be around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2190
01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2191
01:36:49.441 --> 01:36:54.441
<v Speaker 3>what I never had is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I read or seen in other people,</v>

2192
01:36:54.871 --> 01:36:56.820
<v Speaker 3>whatever had that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the shock of death that people,</v>

2193
01:36:56.821 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2194
01:36:58.090 --> 01:37:00.130
<v Speaker 3>the people experience kind of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2195
01:37:00.131 --> 01:37:01.860
<v Speaker 3>the shock of how serious it is.</v>

2196
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:04.360
<v Speaker 1>So if someone grows the business arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2197
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And they see that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have it,</v>

2198
01:37:06.101 --> 01:37:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2199
01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I didn't grow up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't grow up in agriculture but grew</v>

2200
01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:11.660
<v Speaker 3>up in Boston hunting and it was around a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of things.</v>

2201
01:37:11.661 --> 01:37:14.400
<v Speaker 3>But I never had that like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that level of surprise.</v>

2202
01:37:14.401 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you take someone out,</v>

2203
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:22.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first time in my brother's </v>

2204
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:26.950
<v Speaker 3>opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing with their wives or </v>

2205
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.950
<v Speaker 3>girlfriends out or friends out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

2206
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 3>that there's a real reckoning that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have,</v>

2207
01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2208
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.080
<v Speaker 3>the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite someone's response that usually </v>

2209
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:35.080
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2210
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.190
<v Speaker 3>if you kill an animal for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to eat it regardless </v>

2211
01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:39.290
<v Speaker 3>what you can do with kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing animals for the first time,</v>

2212
01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 3>it struck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

2213
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say it's humbling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it stops other thoughts.</v>

2214
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:49.810
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your loan with that thought for a </v>

2215
01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:49.810
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing is,</v>

2216
01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:54.431
<v Speaker 3>as much as I've seen that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had anyone later come to </v>

2217
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:59.990
<v Speaker 3>regret having done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had weeds in some way strengthening </v>

2218
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.900
<v Speaker 3>for people to go to go see that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2219
01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.940
<v Speaker 3>That template gives you more relief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That desk thing.</v>

2220
01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:05.370
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever called me back and said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a terrible mistake</v>

2221
01:38:05.410 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 7>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm intellectually intellectually </v>

2222
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:11.650
<v Speaker 7>knowing that this is a unique experience</v>
<v Speaker 7>for most people.</v>

2223
01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:16.890
<v Speaker 7>How do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how does that make you feel like when </v>

2224
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.150
<v Speaker 7>you see it through their eyes and the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea to you being so alien?</v>

2225
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.400
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting for me and I'm,</v>

2226
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that</v>

2227
01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I already kind of in a way </v>

2228
01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.551
<v Speaker 3>I know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the experience is going to be for </v>

2229
01:38:34.551 --> 01:38:38.631
<v Speaker 3>the person because I think in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about really base aspects </v>

2230
01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.470
<v Speaker 3>of human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2231
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:46.070
<v Speaker 3>and so I kind of can anticipate like if </v>
<v Speaker 3>I take someone out on their first hunt </v>

2232
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.070
<v Speaker 3>and just kind of want to show him </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting first,</v>

2233
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.480
<v Speaker 3>what I usually do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2234
01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 3>because like I respect you guys might </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a good time and respect your </v>

2235
01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:53.770
<v Speaker 3>opinions on things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like wanting to like taking on an</v>

2236
01:38:53.771 --> 01:38:54.510
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna.</v>

2237
01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2238
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:58.590
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be like an immersive </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of experience,</v>

2239
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.860
<v Speaker 3>so I know that there's a certain thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes with that just to kind of get </v>

2240
01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.981
<v Speaker 3>away from stuff and be out in an area </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you've diminished some of the </v>

2241
01:39:06.981 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 3>noise and you're allowed to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

2242
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to put you in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot</v>

2243
01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:10.840
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that</v>

2244
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:13.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like to take someone on a first </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt.</v>

2245
01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worried about like a wild card </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario because I've done it enough to </v>

2246
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.070
<v Speaker 3>where I've seen that it just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

2247
01:39:21.071 --> 01:39:26.071
<v Speaker 3>It's like people go on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a kind of predictable journey on a </v>

2248
01:39:26.071 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 3>hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell them a wild card.</v>

2249
01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I you have some crazy response to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like really unhinging for them </v>

2250
01:39:32.261 --> 01:39:35.140
<v Speaker 3>or that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it would put them into the.</v>

2251
01:39:35.150 --> 01:39:37.780
<v Speaker 3>They would be so depressed or that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be so guilt ridden.</v>

2252
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I've just never had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2253
01:39:39.431 --> 01:39:41.050
<v Speaker 3>it's not like when I go into it I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think like,</v>

2254
01:39:41.051 --> 01:39:46.051
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what's going to happen when </v>

2255
01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:46.051
<v Speaker 3>this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying like,</v>

2256
01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:47.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen is the person who</v>

2257
01:39:47.441 --> 01:39:49.690
<v Speaker 3>have a very fulfilling experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2258
01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.460
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

2259
01:39:51.490 --> 01:39:55.360
<v Speaker 3>They might not ever go hunting again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll always remember back on that</v>

2260
01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:00.500
<v Speaker 3>and have come away and found out </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about themselves and it's </v>

2261
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:00.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never been otherwise.</v>

2262
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:00.900
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

2263
01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I would probably stop if I found that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a high degree,</v>

2264
01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:04.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2265
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:08.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>though with,</v>

2266
01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:09.040
<v Speaker 3>with my own wife.</v>

2267
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:12.940
<v Speaker 3>She didn't grow up around hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2268
01:40:13.570 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 3>and she eats a lot of wild game and has </v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten a lot of wild game since ever </v>

2269
01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:20.920
<v Speaker 3>since she eats more while gaining the 90</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the hunters I know,</v>

2270
01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:22.690
<v Speaker 3>but she just hadn't had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2271
01:40:22.691 --> 01:40:27.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to see an animal get </v>

2272
01:40:27.691 --> 01:40:27.691
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2273
01:40:27.691 --> 01:40:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with the hypocrisy if you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to call it that piracy.</v>

2274
01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat wild game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat meat.</v>

2275
01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I prefer to eat wild game over domestic </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

2276
01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want to see you dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're killed in one day.</v>

2277
01:40:34.961 --> 01:40:38.110
<v Speaker 3>I invited her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were up at my cabin and I invited her</v>

2278
01:40:38.111 --> 01:40:42.820
<v Speaker 3>out on a deer hunt with us and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother wanted to get a deer.</v>

2279
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:47.990
<v Speaker 3>We took our boat out and landed our </v>
<v Speaker 3>skiff at this river mouth and she was </v>

2280
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:51.061
<v Speaker 3>reluctant to go along because she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of what she might see and I had </v>

2281
01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:52.750
<v Speaker 3>encouraged her to come because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen is you won't even</v>

2282
01:40:52.751 --> 01:40:53.590
<v Speaker 3>know the there.</v>

2283
01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:55.270
<v Speaker 3>We're going to spotted deer that's far </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2284
01:40:56.650 --> 01:41:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Probably obscured by brush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to look for it really hard to</v>

2285
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:01.900
<v Speaker 3>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

2286
01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 3>we're going to shoot it by the time we </v>
<v Speaker 3>get over there,</v>

2287
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 3>it'll be dead and it's not really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience you're imagining,</v>

2288
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:12.390
<v Speaker 3>but we beat our skiff and started going </v>
<v Speaker 3>up this gravel bar to stream bank and </v>

2289
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:13.900
<v Speaker 3>here comes three deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something scared him.</v>

2290
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:18.990
<v Speaker 3>A bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what some scared them </v>

2291
01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:20.240
<v Speaker 3>because they're running toward us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get so close that I.</v>

2292
01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:25.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at the eyelashes on this </v>

2293
01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:25.260
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my.</v>

2294
01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.810
<v Speaker 3>They're just there and I see that one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them's got spikes on them is a buck and </v>

2295
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:34.380
<v Speaker 3>it was a buck only sees him and I see my</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother were kind of hunkered down by </v>

2296
01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:35.320
<v Speaker 3>rock and I see him like raised and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>

2297
01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you son of a bitch.</v>

2298
01:41:37.001 --> 01:41:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not shoot this deer right now.</v>

2299
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 3>We'll just get another one later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

2300
01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:43.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>piles that deer up.</v>

2301
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:45.770
<v Speaker 3>And when my wife looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2302
01:41:45.771 --> 01:41:49.900
<v Speaker 3>piles that deer up shot at point blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far away we talk in 10 feet.</v>

2303
01:41:49.901 --> 01:41:54.901
<v Speaker 3>And you have that monitor clove and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it turned and she turned and she </v>

2304
01:41:58.811 --> 01:42:01.360
<v Speaker 3>thought that he had missed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fell over.</v>

2305
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.640
<v Speaker 3>It was foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm exaggerating.</v>

2306
01:42:02.641 --> 01:42:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was very close.</v>

2307
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe twice that distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even twice I just seeing it's eyelash</v>

2308
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.740
<v Speaker 3>talking about like 30 feet and very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2309
01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:13.120
<v Speaker 3>very close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2310
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.600
<v Speaker 3>and when she looked at me after seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she was looking at me across a </v>

2311
01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:23.470
<v Speaker 3>vast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vast Gulf of difference of distance.</v>

2312
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like she looked at me like she </v>

2313
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.250
<v Speaker 3>had never seen you are known me and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked,</v>

2314
01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.050
<v Speaker 3>we have ge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

2315
01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.110
<v Speaker 3>we were just married.</v>

2316
01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:35.710
<v Speaker 3>We were married not even a year and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the look she gave me.</v>

2317
01:42:35.711 --> 01:42:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2318
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 3>this could be the end of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>

2319
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Did she find it sexy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2320
01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:42.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2321
01:42:42.691 --> 01:42:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Come on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2322
01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:46.990
<v Speaker 3>like we were the barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2323
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will,</v>

2324
01:42:47.591 --> 01:42:50.400
<v Speaker 3>you just assassinated was right in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

2325
01:42:50.401 --> 01:42:55.401
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was weird it we're sitting and we </v>

2326
01:42:55.401 --> 01:42:57.721
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we drug the thing down and she didn't </v>

2327
01:42:57.721 --> 01:42:57.721
<v Speaker 3>think we drug it with enough ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2328
01:42:57.721 --> 01:42:58.050
<v Speaker 3>his head was banging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:03.060
<v Speaker 3>we got it out and drug it back through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this gift and started motor and back </v>

2330
01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:07.230
<v Speaker 3>toward our shack and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one was saying a word in the boat</v>

2331
01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:12.160
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then within 45 minutes,</v>

2332
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:16.930
<v Speaker 3>within 45 minutes was enough time for </v>
<v Speaker 3>her to process what she saw and her take</v>

2333
01:43:16.931 --> 01:43:18.750
<v Speaker 3>home was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2334
01:43:18.751 --> 01:43:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'd still rather eat that thing.</v>

2335
01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal from a feed lot.</v>

2336
01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Of course it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just took her a minute because she </v>

2337
01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.130
<v Speaker 3>was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Later I felt like she's like,</v>

2338
01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I should feel something </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than I do.</v>

2339
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I should feel outrage </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually.</v>

2340
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then once you sat in that bowl and </v>

2341
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.030
<v Speaker 3>thought it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just passed,</v>

2342
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.030
<v Speaker 3>it passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2343
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2344
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Things die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating that you have this.</v>

2345
01:43:45.190 --> 01:43:48.940
<v Speaker 3>You have this different point of view on</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

2346
01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Then you know so many people and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your wife</v>

2347
01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.640
<v Speaker 6>to experience it in its most shocking </v>
<v Speaker 6>form on the first pass,</v>

2348
01:43:57.690 --> 01:44:02.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure it would take a little </v>

2349
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:04.721
<v Speaker 6>while to intellectualize something </v>
<v Speaker 6>instinct by butchering the deer and get </v>

2350
01:44:04.721 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 6>my hands in that deer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I kinda thought to myself,</v>

2351
01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:12.460
<v Speaker 6>I can see how I can certainly see how a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hunter would have an easier time taking </v>

2352
01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:15.010
<v Speaker 6>a human's life with a knife or </v>
<v Speaker 6>wonderful.</v>

2353
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:20.110
<v Speaker 6>That'll tight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you have an intimate experience </v>

2354
01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:20.110
<v Speaker 6>with that animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2355
01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:21.910
<v Speaker 6>you're not as squeamish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you,</v>

2356
01:44:21.911 --> 01:44:26.911
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is a strange feeling when you reach </v>

2357
01:44:26.911 --> 01:44:27.010
<v Speaker 6>in there and you feel the guts for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>first time.</v>

2358
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.160
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2359
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.550
<v Speaker 5>The whole experience was really </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating,</v>

2360
01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 5>but I passed out when my wife had an </v>
<v Speaker 5>epidural when she's having her first </v>

2361
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.110
<v Speaker 5>baby because I used to tell people I'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>be like,</v>

2362
01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.620
<v Speaker 5>and I want to write it off as the needle</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2363
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:41.250
<v Speaker 5>I told you I could cut your arm off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't watch you get a shot.</v>

2364
01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:42.540
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so weird.</v>

2365
01:44:42.541 --> 01:44:43.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was thing,</v>

2366
01:44:43.170 --> 01:44:45.930
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know that it translates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people do it.</v>

2367
01:44:45.931 --> 01:44:47.430
<v Speaker 5>There's like an argument against </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting.</v>

2368
01:44:47.431 --> 01:44:49.480
<v Speaker 5>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the attorneys you into like,</v>

2369
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:52.200
<v Speaker 5>like you're so comfortable death and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like an animal.</v>

2370
01:44:52.230 --> 01:44:57.230
<v Speaker 5>That should be the necessarily trans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it translates to being </v>

2371
01:44:57.230 --> 01:45:00.920
<v Speaker 5>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the same argument than </v>

2372
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:06.461
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone who runs a chicken farm can be </v>

2373
01:45:06.461 --> 01:45:06.461
<v Speaker 5>killed chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2374
01:45:06.461 --> 01:45:08.520
<v Speaker 6>I just think that violence transform you</v>
<v Speaker 6>transforms you fundamentally.</v>

2375
01:45:08.521 --> 01:45:13.521
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you've done combat sports and </v>

2376
01:45:13.521 --> 01:45:14.850
<v Speaker 6>you've gotten punched and knocked out or</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicked in the head and knocked out or,</v>

2377
01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.180
<v Speaker 6>or just put into a choking and you are </v>
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>

2378
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:21.240
<v Speaker 6>You are different about your own </v>
<v Speaker 6>mortality,</v>

2379
01:45:21.241 --> 01:45:25.830
<v Speaker 6>your own relationships to other men do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2380
01:45:25.831 --> 01:45:27.080
<v Speaker 6>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you've been,</v>

2381
01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:32.420
<v Speaker 6>when you've been taken,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you've been taken to a man or you </v>

2382
01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:33.570
<v Speaker 6>had somebody do like whatever they want </v>
<v Speaker 6>to and you realize,</v>

2383
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:35.580
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm very vulnerable.</v>

2384
01:45:35.581 --> 01:45:40.581
<v Speaker 6>You or you get knocked out and it really</v>
<v Speaker 6>hurts her hitting the body that I think </v>

2385
01:45:40.591 --> 01:45:43.030
<v Speaker 6>fundamentally changes you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2386
01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:43.620
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2387
01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:46.680
<v Speaker 6>in your relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just to other men.</v>

2388
01:45:46.710 --> 01:45:48.030
<v Speaker 6>How do you think it's related to hunting</v>
<v Speaker 6>though?</v>

2389
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:49.770
<v Speaker 6>In the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you,</v>

2390
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:53.670
<v Speaker 6>when you have an intimate experience of </v>
<v Speaker 6>harvesting your own meat,</v>

2391
01:45:53.970 --> 01:45:56.070
<v Speaker 6>which actually requires a really loud </v>
<v Speaker 6>noise,</v>

2392
01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.540
<v Speaker 6>a killing of an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you see that blood and you feel that</v>

2393
01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.780
<v Speaker 6>just was alive and you're touching it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you go butcher it.</v>

2394
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:08.820
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I approach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2395
01:46:08.821 --> 01:46:09.160
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2396
01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know how to articulate how </v>
<v Speaker 6>it changed me,</v>

2397
01:46:11.701 --> 01:46:14.170
<v Speaker 6>but I do think that something that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2398
01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.840
<v Speaker 6>that is that intimately violent.</v>

2399
01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2400
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:21.150
<v Speaker 5>is going to keep saying violence because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see it as violence at all.</v>

2401
01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.360
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty abrupt in it's ending.</v>

2402
01:46:24.361 --> 01:46:28.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's violent attacks using it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Violence I used to not use,</v>

2403
01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:32.040
<v Speaker 5>I started like coming to turn because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to like sanctify it,</v>

2404
01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:33.230
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2405
01:46:33.231 --> 01:46:34.620
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'd be careful about,</v>

2406
01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:39.650
<v Speaker 5>this is the thing in the hunting world </v>
<v Speaker 5>where people were very reluctant to use </v>

2407
01:46:39.650 --> 01:46:40.320
<v Speaker 5>the word kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's euphemisms for kill harvest.</v>

2408
01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.520
<v Speaker 5>They kind of like harvest or take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I feel like,</v>

2409
01:46:43.521 --> 01:46:45.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean the obvious to the gunshot is </v>
<v Speaker 5>violent,</v>

2410
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:48.190
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the butchering and all that stuff didn't</v>

2411
01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 5>post violence.</v>

2412
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.330
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2413
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 7>But I just mean the blood very graphic </v>
<v Speaker 7>and real temperature of the blood,</v>

2414
01:46:56.851 --> 01:47:01.851
<v Speaker 7>smelling it right up to my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not trying to imply that shooting </v>

2415
01:47:01.851 --> 01:47:04.980
<v Speaker 7>animals wasn't violent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I met the butchering and everything like</v>

2416
01:47:04.981 --> 01:47:06.060
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the whole experience,</v>

2417
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:07.800
<v Speaker 7>I didn't think of it as a violent </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience.</v>

2418
01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.170
<v Speaker 7>It was very surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Very,</v>

2419
01:47:10.171 --> 01:47:11.710
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2420
01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:12.730
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2421
01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:13.500
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a,</v>

2422
01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.430
<v Speaker 7>like a commonly used term,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the connection to nature.</v>

2423
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:22.230
<v Speaker 7>It's one of those terms I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 7>used so much that the meaning of it gets</v>

2424
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:24.330
<v Speaker 7>a little fuzzy to get a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>bullshitty,</v>

2425
01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:27.390
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh my connection to nature and Sot nom,</v>

2426
01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:32.650
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that is what it is when you're out </v>

2427
01:47:32.650 --> 01:47:34.050
<v Speaker 7>there living in that animal's world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sleeping on the ground,</v>

2428
01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:37.860
<v Speaker 7>just basically like they do and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>following them around and shoot one.</v>

2429
01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:40.110
<v Speaker 7>Then you're pulling it's heart and liver</v>
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>

2430
01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.860
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a fucking connection to Sirius.</v>

2431
01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:45.500
<v Speaker 7>I still got a different respect for what</v>
<v Speaker 7>a knife can do.</v>

2432
01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 7>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you go,</v>

2433
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:47.750
<v Speaker 7>wow man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they really do.</v>

2434
01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we talked,</v>

2435
01:47:49.450 --> 01:47:54.450
<v Speaker 7>we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know that that's the thing that I </v>

2436
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:54.450
<v Speaker 7>found like being out with you on that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on that</v>

2437
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:59.170
<v Speaker 3>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the thought of having one with </v>

2438
01:47:59.301 --> 01:48:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Tim Ferris wants is people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been the fighters.</v>

2439
01:48:02.150 --> 01:48:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fighter like I haven't,</v>

2440
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I've been hit a couple of times but </v>
<v Speaker 3>never beat anybody up or anything.</v>

2441
01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Well I beat up one guy in ninth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2442
01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:15.170
<v Speaker 3>but I think that you bring a level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>calmness just to the act of shooting,</v>

2443
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:19.310
<v Speaker 3>like being able to like get down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot some people are.</v>

2444
01:48:19.311 --> 01:48:24.311
<v Speaker 3>So I'm unable to control adrenaline and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>

2445
01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.470
<v Speaker 3>They become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't shoot.</v>

2446
01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:28.970
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could.</v>

2447
01:48:29.490 --> 01:48:31.370
<v Speaker 7>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got a buddy who guide</v>

2448
01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:34.660
<v Speaker 3>and he was saying one time he took this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy up and they were hunting tar in,</v>

2449
01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:39.770
<v Speaker 3>in New Zealand and the guy shot in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy's watching through his binoculars </v>

2450
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:42.100
<v Speaker 3>where the bullet hit in any show me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was rolling a video.</v>

2451
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:45.010
<v Speaker 3>When did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you hear my body say you,</v>

2452
01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:46.570
<v Speaker 3>you're 20 feet high.</v>

2453
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.870
<v Speaker 7>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hi.</v>

2454
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:54.590
<v Speaker 7>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of,</v>

2455
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:57.300
<v Speaker 7>just the amount of time I've reversed </v>
<v Speaker 7>his mind.</v>

2456
01:48:57.301 --> 01:49:00.180
<v Speaker 7>He left his mind when I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when uh,</v>

2457
01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.240
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would have been able to shoot that </v>

2458
01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.161
<v Speaker 7>deer with the first time we saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I didn't have enough practice with </v>

2459
01:49:07.161 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 7>that scope and I was too close to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>scope and you know,</v>

2460
01:49:09.841 --> 01:49:13.840
<v Speaker 7>he get that weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't find him in there too.</v>

2461
01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:18.860
<v Speaker 7>It was almost like to like a black half </v>
<v Speaker 7>moons criss crossing over into that.</v>

2462
01:49:19.371 --> 01:49:21.690
<v Speaker 7>Couldn't like get the image more than </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2463
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.140
<v Speaker 7>More than that.</v>

2464
01:49:22.190 --> 01:49:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2465
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:28.200
<v Speaker 3>is cause of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of beginner hunters.</v>

2466
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:31.460
<v Speaker 7>Not Getting shots at things is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>weird.</v>

2467
01:49:31.461 --> 01:49:33.020
<v Speaker 7>I like the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really fishes,</v>

2468
01:49:33.021 --> 01:49:38.021
<v Speaker 7>it becomes very second nature but pretty</v>
<v Speaker 7>precise like where you put it and when </v>

2469
01:49:38.021 --> 01:49:39.620
<v Speaker 7>you're in like in a weird position and </v>
<v Speaker 7>things were happening fast.</v>

2470
01:49:39.621 --> 01:49:40.370
<v Speaker 7>It's tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:49:40.371 --> 01:49:41.450
<v Speaker 7>For folks who don't know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>saying,</v>

2472
01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:44.930
<v Speaker 7>there's a scope on the top of the rifle </v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you're too close to that scope,</v>

2473
01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.670
<v Speaker 7>it distorts your view.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It fucks up.</v>

2474
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 7>You have to be just</v>

2475
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.280
<v Speaker 5>in the right spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the first time we saw the deer I </v>

2476
01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.840
<v Speaker 5>couldn't get it in the right spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he went behind this little area</v>

2477
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:58.870
<v Speaker 5>and then came back out again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when he came back out again,</v>

2478
01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:02.040
<v Speaker 5>I was able to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I pulled back a little bit.</v>

2479
01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2480
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:04.960
<v Speaker 5>there it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was freaking out.</v>

2481
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:09.961
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't fucking see this thing and if I </v>

2482
01:50:09.961 --> 01:50:10.780
<v Speaker 5>lose this fucking deer because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll go crazy.</v>

2483
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:16.290
<v Speaker 5>We have been stalking them for days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just excuse me.</v>

2484
01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Just one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:21.190
<v Speaker 5>to get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2486
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:24.970
<v Speaker 5>I was desperate to motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That comes out,</v>

2487
01:50:24.971 --> 01:50:29.971
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of things that like </v>

2488
01:50:29.971 --> 01:50:30.620
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of things that come out in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huntington I think are applicable to the</v>

2489
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:35.790
<v Speaker 5>life and work and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you get like when you've been out </v>

2490
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:37.120
<v Speaker 5>there a couple of days and you start </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting accustomed to that.</v>

2491
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.480
<v Speaker 5>I think it's easy to go for a day and </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk me.</v>

2492
01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:42.190
<v Speaker 5>They already didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a couple of days into something.</v>

2493
01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 5>Most people like what I would almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>call it,</v>

2494
01:50:44.770 --> 01:50:47.260
<v Speaker 5>like a work ethic or like something </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes up where you're like,</v>

2495
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:48.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've committed ourselves to this.</v>

2496
01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 5>We put time into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're out here and you just want to make</v>

2497
01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 5>it happen and it brings out a level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>drive.</v>

2498
01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.090
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good to come to fulfill the goal of that</v>

2499
01:50:58.091 --> 01:51:03.091
<v Speaker 5>moment becomes such a gigantic sweeping </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment and that's why it's hard to like </v>

2500
01:51:03.091 --> 01:51:07.861
<v Speaker 5>stay calm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it actually happens when you're </v>

2501
01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:10.201
<v Speaker 5>building up with two days of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty camping and one with a Bahraini </v>

2502
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:15.510
<v Speaker 5>and pouring outside and coal every </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning and going to bed at like eight </v>

2503
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:17.050
<v Speaker 5>because there's nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets dark.</v>

2504
01:51:17.051 --> 01:51:22.051
<v Speaker 5>We all just go to bed and then we'd get </v>
<v Speaker 5>up and like where are we getting up at </v>

2505
01:51:22.051 --> 01:51:22.051
<v Speaker 5>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six in the morning,</v>

2506
01:51:22.051 --> 01:51:22.410
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2507
01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 5>And then just wandering around trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>find a deer and um,</v>

2508
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:27.620
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2509
01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:31.960
<v Speaker 5>one of the craziest visions was when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were on the top of one of those hills.</v>

2510
01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:36.520
<v Speaker 5>And you look around at the vastness of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that area.</v>

2511
01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.710
<v Speaker 5>And man was that fucking humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were standing.</v>

2512
01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.080
<v Speaker 5>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember this.</v>

2513
01:51:41.081 --> 01:51:46.081
<v Speaker 5>We were on the top of one of the hills </v>
<v Speaker 5>is one of the first time you spotted a </v>

2514
01:51:46.081 --> 01:51:46.081
<v Speaker 5>sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were,</v>

2515
01:51:46.081 --> 01:51:50.250
<v Speaker 5>you were glass in the area and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>spotted a big sheep way the fuck away </v>

2516
01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:51.730
<v Speaker 5>from us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when we're on top,</v>

2517
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:56.731
<v Speaker 5>we're looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just get up looking over at the </v>

2518
01:51:56.731 --> 01:52:00.811
<v Speaker 5>vastness of this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could just start walking and </v>

2519
01:52:00.811 --> 01:52:03.100
<v Speaker 5>starve to death and nobody would ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>find you.</v>

2520
01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:08.250
<v Speaker 5>I thought when we ever find you out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there talking about how cold it was all </v>

2521
01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:09.790
<v Speaker 5>the time and starving to death and how </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have no light,</v>

2522
01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.860
<v Speaker 5>you can keep that stone age shit.</v>

2523
01:52:12.330 --> 01:52:16.090
<v Speaker 5>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I enjoyed it for five days.</v>

2524
01:52:16.091 --> 01:52:18.040
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a humbling area though,</v>

2525
01:52:18.041 --> 01:52:23.041
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's one of those cool areas that </v>

2526
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:24.511
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again to talk about the Missouri </v>

2527
01:52:24.511 --> 01:52:25.270
<v Speaker 5>Breaks region,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those cool areas that really</v>

2528
01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:28.960
<v Speaker 5>just kind of on its own resistant </v>
<v Speaker 5>development.</v>

2529
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:34.110
<v Speaker 5>If there's some spots that were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were so stunning that early on people </v>

2530
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like you'll 70 yellowstone.</v>

2531
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:41.290
<v Speaker 5>It was like the momentum was always </v>
<v Speaker 5>going toward hanging onto it.</v>

2532
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.110
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people wonder like this is special.</v>

2533
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:45.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean we got hot guys was shooting up </v>
<v Speaker 5>out the ground.</v>

2534
01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:49.730
<v Speaker 3>We should early on like make sure does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not screw this place up.</v>

2535
01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.350
<v Speaker 3>And there's some great areas in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would argue hell's kitchen,</v>

2536
01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:59.380
<v Speaker 3>hell's canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Missouri breaks reason that just </v>

2537
01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:02.810
<v Speaker 3>remained peer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just through toughness and tenacity.</v>

2538
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.420
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody went in there and tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something.</v>

2539
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like one of those places where </v>

2540
01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:10.480
<v Speaker 3>you go and it's like they try to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't work out.</v>

2541
01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that that place </v>
<v Speaker 3>is known for is it horse thieves use.</v>

2542
01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.410
<v Speaker 3>It does go there because they knew they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could go hide out,</v>

2543
01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:23.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like useful to them just as a </v>

2544
01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:23.980
<v Speaker 3>place to hide out and there was some </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaigns where it was like,</v>

2545
01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:25.610
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go into the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to find them all,</v>

2546
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:30.670
<v Speaker 3>we're going to hang him from cottonwoods</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd go down in and root out the </v>

2547
01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:30.670
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

2548
01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:32.480
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a spot that held </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife for long time,</v>

2549
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:37.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a spot where some of the plains </v>

2550
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:37.870
<v Speaker 3>tribes could go down and hide out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2551
01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:43.140
<v Speaker 3>In the Mussel shell that goes into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>area was one of the last place they had </v>

2552
01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.480
<v Speaker 3>free roaming herds of Buffalo in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana.</v>

2553
01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:49.770
<v Speaker 3>It was just like a spot where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would try to get a grip and it just </v>

2554
01:53:49.770 --> 01:53:51.500
<v Speaker 3>didn't hold and now it still isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

2555
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:57.010
<v Speaker 3>There's some protections there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like categorically </v>

2556
01:53:57.010 --> 01:53:57.010
<v Speaker 3>protected like a place like yellowstone </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2557
01:53:57.010 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after awhile people almost kind of threw</v>

2558
01:53:58.911 --> 01:54:00.980
<v Speaker 3>their hands up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It interesting that you're talking about</v>

2559
01:54:00.981 --> 01:54:01.120
<v Speaker 3>is</v>

2560
01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:05.120
<v Speaker 7>because I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like the people trying to settle in</v>

2561
01:54:05.121 --> 01:54:06.890
<v Speaker 7>that area couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they couldn't live.</v>

2562
01:54:06.891 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 7>They couldn't run farms grow stuff </v>
<v Speaker 7>couldn't grow.</v>

2563
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.720
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

2564
01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would go in and try to um,</v>

2565
01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:14.650
<v Speaker 3>do you homesteads they try to run.</v>

2566
01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:18.130
<v Speaker 7>Government says that if you stay on this</v>
<v Speaker 7>land for x amount of time,</v>

2567
01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:21.020
<v Speaker 3>yours is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do improvements on it,</v>

2568
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:26.280
<v Speaker 7>you do improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there was all these homesteads sites </v>

2569
01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:28.741
<v Speaker 7>where we were walking around and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 7>find these really old logs that used to </v>

2570
01:54:28.741 --> 01:54:30.210
<v Speaker 7>be a side of a house.</v>

2571
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:34.130
<v Speaker 3>The sheep shacks or sad houses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Root cellars.</v>

2572
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.520
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's our root cellar be like under </v>

2573
01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:44.080
<v Speaker 3>like a climate controlled area where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>dig down into the ground and have like a</v>

2574
01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:49.691
<v Speaker 3>cruel place to store things or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it also be freeze proof because </v>

2575
01:54:49.691 --> 01:54:49.691
<v Speaker 3>you're down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2576
01:54:49.691 --> 01:54:54.190
<v Speaker 3>you go down to the dirt ways and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still a lot of old structures </v>

2577
01:54:54.190 --> 01:54:54.190
<v Speaker 3>there to have sought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2578
01:54:54.190 --> 01:54:58.031
<v Speaker 3>you can see that it had a sod roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far do you have to go to in the </v>

2579
01:54:58.031 --> 01:54:58.460
<v Speaker 3>ground before it becomes freeze proof?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2580
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:00.760
<v Speaker 3>however far down the frost line is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you put in,</v>

2581
01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have a frost,</v>

2582
01:55:01.930 --> 01:55:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you rise in your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you got to most places like in </v>

2583
01:55:06.930 --> 01:55:09.431
<v Speaker 3>Michigan member we'd only go to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>frost for your eyes are only went down </v>

2584
01:55:09.431 --> 01:55:09.431
<v Speaker 3>36 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fucked up is it?</v>

2585
01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.930
<v Speaker 3>They go deep into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It stops being cold.</v>

2586
01:55:11.931 --> 01:55:13.110
<v Speaker 3>When you go deep enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll burn</v>

2587
01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:14.790
<v Speaker 7>your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but isn't that,</v>

2588
01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.800
<v Speaker 7>is that why it is getting past the </v>
<v Speaker 7>surface and it's getting closer to the </v>

2589
01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:23.790
<v Speaker 7>public.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In Alaska what they do is they dig down </v>

2590
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.790
<v Speaker 7>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the</v>

2591
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.790
<v Speaker 3>permafrost and use that for </v>
<v Speaker 3>refrigeration.</v>

2592
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:26.320
<v Speaker 3>All year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

2593
01:55:26.321 --> 01:55:27.850
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So does that.</v>

2594
01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Wow guys used you read about guys on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prairie.</v>

2595
01:55:30.941 --> 01:55:35.941
<v Speaker 3>They used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would in the winter hunt and dig </v>

2596
01:55:35.941 --> 01:55:36.850
<v Speaker 3>down into the ground where the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>was frozen.</v>

2597
01:55:37.090 --> 01:55:39.490
<v Speaker 3>There was in the winter hunt and fill </v>
<v Speaker 3>that with animals,</v>

2598
01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.640
<v Speaker 3>fill it with corridors of meat and let </v>
<v Speaker 3>that freeze in the winter and then pile </v>

2599
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.220
<v Speaker 3>canvas down or blankets on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put dirt back on so it would freeze and </v>

2600
01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:49.660
<v Speaker 3>it dig that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Months into the summer.</v>

2601
01:55:49.661 --> 01:55:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Net meets</v>

<v Speaker 1>good down there on campus,</v>

2603
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:56.810
<v Speaker 3>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dig a big deep pit,</v>

2604
01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:01.960
<v Speaker 3>eight feet deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever and put me in and let it get </v>

2605
01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.920
<v Speaker 3>frozen and then piled dirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let all that frees up and then it'll get</v>

2606
01:56:03.921 --> 01:56:05.590
<v Speaker 3>warm out and you could dig down there </v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

2607
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.040
<v Speaker 1>The mito who's a fucking genius who </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured that out.</v>

2608
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.260
<v Speaker 1>That's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about worms and stuff?</v>

2609
01:56:10.261 --> 01:56:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dude,</v>

2610
01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching.</v>

2611
01:56:13.190 --> 01:56:14.690
<v Speaker 3>There's not getting fly larva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2612
01:56:14.691 --> 01:56:16.940
<v Speaker 3>if you let flies land on it and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot out and you buried it,</v>

2613
01:56:16.941 --> 01:56:19.100
<v Speaker 3>you'd have a mess on your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2614
01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 1>anybody knows if you dig a hole and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand on there,</v>

2615
01:56:21.331 --> 01:56:23.400
<v Speaker 1>it's cool down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2616

<v Speaker 1>Have you seen any of those con men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different shows and these </v>

2619
01:56:32.901 --> 01:56:36.411
<v Speaker 1>people just live up there and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>been living up there for generations </v>

2620
01:56:36.411 --> 01:56:36.411
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>good lot of crafting this man.</v>

01:56:42.110 --> 01:56:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Carnivores straight up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2625
01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.190
<v Speaker 1>four months that they have to do so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a greenhouse and shit,</v>

2626
01:56:50.191 --> 01:56:52.650
<v Speaker 1>but most of their food they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2627
01:56:52.710 --> 01:56:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting animals.</v>

2628
01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:58.350

2629
01:56:58.351 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but where do they get their vitamin C in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their micronutrient freshmeat GNC</v>

2630
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:05.160
<v Speaker 3>that GNC is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get scurvy.</v>

01:57:05.210 --> 01:57:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Freshman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this amazing story.</v>

2632
01:57:06.671 --> 01:57:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this amazing story,</v>

2633
01:57:07.751 --> 01:57:09.670
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the blood in it.</v>

2634
01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>lose it.</v>

2636
01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:13.690
<v Speaker 3>So even when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you put in,</v>

2637
01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:15.970
<v Speaker 3>when you put fruit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're making fruit Jerky,</v>

2638
01:57:15.971 --> 01:57:17.620
<v Speaker 3>put bananas in a dehydrated or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2639
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:21.730
<v Speaker 3>fruit loses vitamin C you through </v>
<v Speaker 3>dehydration on there's some loss of it.</v>

2640
01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:23.710
<v Speaker 3>There's this amazing story about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>French.</v>

2641
01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.880
<v Speaker 3>When the French started going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming over here to engage in the trade </v>

2642
01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:31.861
<v Speaker 3>and do all their explorer and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>centered around like a focal point of </v>

2643
01:57:31.861 --> 01:57:34.891
<v Speaker 3>the St Lawrence Seaway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>champlain guy that's now the father of </v>

2644
01:57:34.891 --> 01:57:38.271
<v Speaker 3>new France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had this idea where he's going to </v>

2645
01:57:38.271 --> 01:57:42.061
<v Speaker 3>take a orphans from Paris and bring them</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and given to the Indians thinking </v>

2646
01:57:44.201 --> 01:57:46.840
<v Speaker 3>that the kids already knew French.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd give him to the Indians.</v>

2647
01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.820
<v Speaker 3>They need to go take them off for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years,</v>

2648
01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:52.810
<v Speaker 3>come back and they'd be bilingual and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be able to use these as emissaries,</v>

2649
01:57:53.230 --> 01:57:58.230
<v Speaker 3>ambassadors and trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the first ones that we know </v>

2650
01:57:58.230 --> 01:57:58.630
<v Speaker 3>about that you tried this with is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid who's later.</v>

2651
01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.640
<v Speaker 3>We now people come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etienne Brulay gave them to the Indians </v>

2652
01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:08.820
<v Speaker 3>and the when the first winter when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>came in with champlain is people came </v>

2653
01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:10.120
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they died like mad of scurvy all winter,</v>

2654
01:58:10.330 --> 01:58:15.330
<v Speaker 3>but this kid was supposed to go hang out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with any of this so they would go out </v>

2655
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:16.300
<v Speaker 3>and fish through the ice and hunt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were eating the meat diet,</v>

2656
01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.190
<v Speaker 3>but they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2657
01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 3>24 fatalities that year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of people all died </v>

2658
01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:25.870
<v Speaker 3>could never died and everybody else's </v>
<v Speaker 3>holed up in their cabins,</v>

2659
01:58:25.871 --> 01:58:27.820
<v Speaker 3>eating hard tack and salt pork and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2660
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.700
<v Speaker 3>and this kid that was out roaming around</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating fresh killed,</v>

2661
01:58:30.701 --> 01:58:32.980
<v Speaker 3>meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>survived,</v>

2662
01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.350
<v Speaker 3>and then later went on to do all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

2663
01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Made all these discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the first person to see lake </v>

2664
01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.751
<v Speaker 3>superior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First person all over the Great Lakes </v>

2665
01:58:42.751 --> 01:58:44.641
<v Speaker 3>went down all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The [inaudible] river might've been the </v>

2666
01:58:44.641 --> 01:58:45.880
<v Speaker 3>first white guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lay eyes was behind.</v>

2667
01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:46.930
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2668
01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is just A.</v>

2669
01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Joey is a.</v>

2670
01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:55.100
<v Speaker 1>There was apparently something in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurel and hardy called the sasquatch.</v>

2671
01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Hannah hat company and the Susko and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hat company,</v>

2672
01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.070
<v Speaker 1>like they had shitty hats and they'd put</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hats on.</v>

2673
01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.570
<v Speaker 1>The top would pop off like this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really old stuff.</v>

2674
01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And Joey Diaz once went on this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>rant for like 10 minutes about how our </v>

2675
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:10.280
<v Speaker 1>weed was Susko handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need this fucking sucks into weed.</v>

2676
01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know what he meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was talking about Hannah </v>

2677
01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was totally confused.</v>

2678
01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:20.351
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you fucking feed me </v>

2679
01:59:20.351 --> 01:59:20.351
<v Speaker 1>over here?</v>

2680
01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:22.320
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eventually eight,</v>

2681
01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:25.110
<v Speaker 3>this kid ate quiet dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:59:25.111 --> 01:59:28.020
<v Speaker 3>That was common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was another gay man</v>

2683
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you told me that a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2684
01:59:30.171 --> 01:59:32.560
<v Speaker 1>the tribes of the Great Lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cannibalism,</v>

2685
01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:33.670
<v Speaker 1>that's fairly common out there.</v>

2686
01:59:33.690 --> 01:59:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mandated quarter people out.</v>

2687
01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>

2688
01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.680
<v Speaker 3>what tribes were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were dealing with the Iroquois eight </v>

2689
01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Brulay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2690
01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.760
<v Speaker 3>that said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See he was going,</v>

2691
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:49.820
<v Speaker 3>he wants to go and totally feral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went totally native and in the </v>

2692
01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:50.610
<v Speaker 3>French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the French even disowned him,</v>

2693
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:51.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

2694
01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:56.730
<v Speaker 3>he had complained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd come back for the trading season </v>

2695
01:59:56.730 --> 01:59:56.940
<v Speaker 3>with Indians and they complained that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2696
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:58.290
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2697
01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:00.480
<v Speaker 3>his morality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had conformed to the tribes,</v>

2698
02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:04.350
<v Speaker 3>like you're going to turn a 13 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>over to some,</v>

2699
02:00:04.410 --> 02:00:09.410
<v Speaker 3>to an indigenous culture and go away for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple years and he's going to come </v>

2700
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.870
<v Speaker 3>back still acting like a French </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic.</v>

2701
02:00:10.410 --> 02:00:12.900
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the story of target.</v>

2702
02:00:12.930 --> 02:00:17.930
<v Speaker 3>They were like really upset that he came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and he was very promiscuous in his </v>

2703
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:21.381
<v Speaker 3>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed his hair and more native </v>

2704
02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:21.381
<v Speaker 3>dress modern.</v>

2705
02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:24.090
<v Speaker 3>So he integrated and eventually he got </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a legend,</v>

2706
02:00:24.091 --> 02:00:29.091
<v Speaker 3>has it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much they really know </v>

2707
02:00:29.091 --> 02:00:30.741
<v Speaker 3>about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legend has he gotten a dispute over a </v>

2708
02:00:30.741 --> 02:00:32.520
<v Speaker 3>woman up on Georgian Bay and Lake Huron </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they cooked them and ate them,</v>

2709
02:00:32.610 --> 02:00:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would,</v>

2710
02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:38.900
<v Speaker 3>they would boil them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what these guys would do in this </v>

2711
02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.951
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of these tribes when the </v>

2712
02:00:42.951 --> 02:00:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Great Lakes area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would sometimes they would just </v>

2713
02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:46.671
<v Speaker 3>carry captives in the boat live and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>butcher one you wanted to eat them or </v>

2714
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:53.870
<v Speaker 3>they would rate an area in butcher </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone and to stack the quarters in </v>

2715
02:00:54.331 --> 02:00:56.160
<v Speaker 3>the bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's accounts of people talk about</v>

2716
02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:58.940
<v Speaker 3>human legs stacked up and bolts just as </v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling,</v>

2717
02:00:58.950 --> 02:01:01.440
<v Speaker 3>food prune long and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of that stuff.</v>

2718
02:01:01.450 --> 02:01:05.130
<v Speaker 3>You're making people eat parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and you know,</v>

2719
02:01:05.131 --> 02:01:08.090
<v Speaker 3>like cutting off their fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>making them meet your finger,</v>

2720
02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:10.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like having a big sport out of it.</v>

2721
02:01:10.651 --> 02:01:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Just just comprehensible now man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people argue,</v>

2722
02:01:15.091 --> 02:01:17.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropologists argue that all,</v>

2723
02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:22.580
<v Speaker 3>all had that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that violence had some societal </v>

2724
02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:23.450
<v Speaker 3>function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2725
02:01:23.451 --> 02:01:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this side of the function </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

2726
02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>So this brutality man legs in a boat for</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel food.</v>

2727
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2728
02:01:31.490 --> 02:01:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in,</v>

2729
02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:35.000
<v Speaker 3>we're in New Zealand film and in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zealand we went and looked at this,</v>

2730
02:01:35.210 --> 02:01:39.620
<v Speaker 3>this island in this big lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they say is that the indigenous</v>

2731
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.070
<v Speaker 5>people in New Zealand and South Island </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wedding Benner that long,</v>

2732
02:01:43.071 --> 02:01:46.160
<v Speaker 5>but they had been there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had some people would come from the</v>

2733
02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:49.420
<v Speaker 5>North Island and conquered the people in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the South Island.</v>

2734
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:54.490
<v Speaker 5>It would keep stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have them out on this island and when </v>

2735
02:01:54.490 --> 02:01:58.860
<v Speaker 5>and staked out and when they want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>paddle out and get them an Itam,</v>

2736
02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:03.170
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like Cormac Mccarthy's the road,</v>

2737
02:02:03.171 --> 02:02:05.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of fascinating that,</v>

2738
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:06.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to the road,</v>

2739
02:02:06.591 --> 02:02:11.591
<v Speaker 5>I watched the movie until he was showing</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kid at to shoot himself in the </v>

2740
02:02:11.591 --> 02:02:11.591
<v Speaker 5>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I went,</v>

2741
02:02:11.591 --> 02:02:11.591
<v Speaker 5>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2742
02:02:11.591 --> 02:02:14.030
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Need this fucking visual in my brain.</v>

2743
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:14.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2744
02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.010
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2745
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:21.011
<v Speaker 5>the idea that this was happening on like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a really regular basis is really not.</v>

2746
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:24.530
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people don't know that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>all in the folklore here.</v>

2747
02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.630
<v Speaker 5>The native American that's never </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussed.</v>

2748
02:02:26.631 --> 02:02:30.410
<v Speaker 5>It's always they were in one with nature</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how they were peaceful.</v>

2749
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Do the wide band,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but white van,</v>

2750
02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:34.130
<v Speaker 5>they were human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>

2751
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:39.550
<v Speaker 5>I know it's so hard to come to grips </v>
<v Speaker 5>with what happened to the indigenous </v>

2752
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:40.880
<v Speaker 5>peoples here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so hard to come to grips to it that</v>

2753
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:45.050
<v Speaker 5>you people wind up going in wild </v>
<v Speaker 5>directions.</v>

2754
02:02:45.230 --> 02:02:48.020
<v Speaker 5>It's like did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just brutal savage re,</v>

2755
02:02:48.230 --> 02:02:53.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just awful existence or that it </v>

2756
02:02:53.230 --> 02:02:53.360
<v Speaker 5>was just like peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>harmonious existence.</v>

2757
02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:56.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's really hard to just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2758
02:02:56.301 --> 02:03:01.301
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were complex and varied cultures </v>

2759
02:03:01.730 --> 02:03:06.730
<v Speaker 5>that lived here that had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that were human works and.</v>

2760
02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:08.930
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well the Sioux,</v>

2761
02:03:09.130 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 5>you know the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2762
02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:15.240
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the word sue means Indian and Indian </v>

2763
02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 5>means enemy there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They call themselves the Lakota people.</v>

2764
02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:19.220
<v Speaker 5>The word sue apparently was what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other Indians called them.</v>

2765
02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:23.210
<v Speaker 5>There's a similar thing with basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a derogatory term.</v>

2766
02:03:23.211 --> 02:03:27.340
<v Speaker 5>The athabaskan people refer to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>coastal people as you know,</v>

2767
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:32.350
<v Speaker 5>years of raw fish or whatever and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>became like a derogatory term that </v>

2768
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.350
<v Speaker 5>stuck.</v>

2769
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:37.060
<v Speaker 5>It's really crazy when you stop and </v>
<v Speaker 5>think about the idea that up until </v>

2770
02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:41.140
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago and the first people who </v>

2771
02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:41.500
<v Speaker 5>wonder when did the Vikings get here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

2772
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:46.870
<v Speaker 5>the first year was the first humans here</v>
<v Speaker 5>in north for $14,000</v>

2773
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:49.000
<v Speaker 5>was for as humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2774
02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:54.040
<v Speaker 5>just think about these people that lived</v>
<v Speaker 5>like no one else in a big continent </v>

2775
02:03:54.891 --> 02:03:59.891
<v Speaker 5>anywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They traveled the entire thing and they </v>

2776
02:03:59.891 --> 02:04:03.461
<v Speaker 5>had all these little tribes and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were hunting and they were all living </v>

2777
02:04:03.461 --> 02:04:04.910
<v Speaker 5>this crazy sort of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gathering lifestyle,</v>

2778
02:04:04.911 --> 02:04:07.700
<v Speaker 5>like an entire continent filled with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people doing it.</v>

2779
02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.990
<v Speaker 5>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2780
02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:15.100
<v Speaker 5>according to a lot of scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they believe that there are 20 plus </v>

2781
02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:18.190
<v Speaker 5>million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a native American Buffalo.</v>

2782
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:19.160
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

2783
02:04:19.161 --> 02:04:24.161
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>though the episode that you shot wild </v>

2784
02:04:24.161 --> 02:04:27.031
<v Speaker 5>buffalo in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a fascinating episode and it </v>

2785
02:04:27.031 --> 02:04:28.580
<v Speaker 5>made me really stop and think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2786
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 5>when you were describing the imagery of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it used to look like,</v>

2787
02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 5>seeing buffaloes roam across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

2788
02:04:35.871 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 5>that they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

2789
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.980
<v Speaker 7>the shadows from giant clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like the entire land would be </v>

2790
02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:45.780
<v Speaker 7>covered in buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this is how it was for these fucking</v>

2791
02:04:45.781 --> 02:04:48.780
<v Speaker 7>people that lived here for what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10,000</v>

2792
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:50.640
<v Speaker 7>years or something from whenever the </v>
<v Speaker 7>water.</v>

2793
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:55.320
<v Speaker 7>The ice thawed and became the Great </v>
<v Speaker 7>Lakes experience in apocalypse of sorts.</v>

2794
02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:57.960
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't a fucking Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the,</v>

2795
02:04:57.961 --> 02:04:59.250
<v Speaker 7>it's the avatar movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2796
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:00.660
<v Speaker 7>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy shit.</v>

2797
02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:05.960
<v Speaker 7>If you really stop and think about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fact that the entire continent have all </v>

2798
02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:08.730
<v Speaker 7>these people living this well we think </v>
<v Speaker 7>of is like a very romantic life,</v>

2799
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:10.750
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>campaign with leather,</v>

2800
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:15.830
<v Speaker 7>tps and shit and out there making fire </v>
<v Speaker 7>and dance in and hunting and it's pretty</v>

2801
02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:21.801
<v Speaker 7>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The rest of the country shooting canon </v>

2802
02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:21.801
<v Speaker 7>balls off a boats and you know what I </v>
<v Speaker 7>mean?</v>

2803
02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:25.881
<v Speaker 7>They're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're developing eyeglasses and </v>

2804
02:05:25.881 --> 02:05:30.320
<v Speaker 7>navigating the seas and giant hamp sales</v>
<v Speaker 7>and medicine and these fucking people </v>

2805
02:05:30.961 --> 02:05:34.500
<v Speaker 7>arrived around even riding on horses.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2806
02:05:34.530 --> 02:05:36.360
<v Speaker 7>It's like they weren't even until the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Spaniards came.</v>

2807
02:05:36.361 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2808
02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:41.840
<v Speaker 3>It's funny that so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many guys that hunt become interested</v>

2809
02:05:42.961 --> 02:05:43.410
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2810
02:05:43.411 --> 02:05:48.411
<v Speaker 3>in like early cultures and it's obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you'd like to hunt animals,</v>

2811
02:05:48.541 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 3>you become interested in hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 3>societies,</v>

2812
02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:53.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to look at it,</v>

2813
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:58.760
<v Speaker 3>not from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just from like how great the hunting </v>

2814
02:05:58.760 --> 02:05:58.760
<v Speaker 3>most of bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at it from other aspects.</v>

2815
02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Just like to live like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the with the plains Indians.</v>

2816
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:06.470
<v Speaker 3>The proximity to death is you cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're living in the most war </v>

2817
02:06:07.111 --> 02:06:12.111
<v Speaker 3>torn region of the world today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably can't fathom the proximity </v>

2818
02:06:12.111 --> 02:06:13.030
<v Speaker 3>to death that you lived around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:14.760
<v Speaker 3>That you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird now.</v>

2820
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:19.761
<v Speaker 3>Like our culture is so easy and so soft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always meet people who are in their </v>

2821
02:06:19.761 --> 02:06:21.750
<v Speaker 3>thirties and forties and I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a dead person.</v>

2822
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Like you can go through life and not lay</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes on a dead person.</v>

2823
02:06:26.770 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 7>I didn't see a dead person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think like real close up until um,</v>

2824
02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:35.400
<v Speaker 7>my grandfather died and then he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they embalmed him so it didn't even seem</v>

2825
02:06:35.471 --> 02:06:40.471
<v Speaker 7>real at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They had makeup on him and it's really </v>

2826
02:06:40.471 --> 02:06:41.860
<v Speaker 7>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't recognize my grandfather in.</v>

2827
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:46.990
<v Speaker 7>They're hard as a rock and then they </v>
<v Speaker 7>just seem like these weird empty vessels</v>

2828
02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:48.110
<v Speaker 7>because what they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what they do is what,</v>

2829
02:06:48.190 --> 02:06:49.810
<v Speaker 7>don't they suck you dry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2830
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:50.560
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they drain,</v>

2831
02:06:50.561 --> 02:06:53.710
<v Speaker 7>you name it and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they use formaldehyde I guess,</v>

2832
02:06:53.711 --> 02:06:56.080
<v Speaker 7>and do fluid or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they do,</v>

2833
02:06:56.081 --> 02:07:01.081
<v Speaker 7>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They do it with like an IV drip or some </v>

2834
02:07:01.081 --> 02:07:03.361
<v Speaker 7>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how they get in the veins </v>

2835
02:07:03.361 --> 02:07:04.670
<v Speaker 7>of the formaldehyde.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2836
02:07:04.690 --> 02:07:07.240
<v Speaker 7>it's fucking gross out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2837
02:07:07.241 --> 02:07:12.241
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'd like them all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So have you ever seen the Tibetans sky </v>

2838
02:07:12.241 --> 02:07:13.930
<v Speaker 7>burial?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jamie put up,</v>

2839
02:07:13.931 --> 02:07:16.540
<v Speaker 7>pull up some images of Tibetans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sky burial.</v>

2840
02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:19.450
<v Speaker 7>What they do is they take a body and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they uh,</v>

2841
02:07:19.451 --> 02:07:20.660
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they quarter it,</v>

2842
02:07:20.661 --> 02:07:25.661
<v Speaker 7>they chop it up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they smash the bones down and then they </v>

2843
02:07:25.661 --> 02:07:29.791
<v Speaker 7>leave it out there for the vultures.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Vultures come in there and essentially </v>

2844
02:07:29.791 --> 02:07:32.650
<v Speaker 7>pick everything clean if like I could </v>
<v Speaker 7>trust my brothers to do it.</v>

2845
02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:34.990
<v Speaker 7>Like I just trust them implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there'll be,</v>

2846
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 7>they're older than me so</v>

2847
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 3>they'd be too old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'd be like if I knew someone I </v>

2848
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 3>could really trust and I said when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>

2849
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:45.481
<v Speaker 3>I want you to just take my body out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of bears and stuff and just </v>

2850
02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:48.340
<v Speaker 3>chop it up real good and just stir it </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the ground,</v>

2851
02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:51.310
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that way,</v>

2852
02:07:51.311 --> 02:07:56.311
<v Speaker 3>even though it'd be dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't even know what actually </v>

2853
02:07:56.311 --> 02:07:56.311
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would just be nice to have it be the,</v>

2854
02:07:56.311 --> 02:07:59.050
<v Speaker 3>as I was dying to be like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2855
02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:04.060
<v Speaker 3>that will happen to you even want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a chopped up because you don't want </v>

2856
02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:05.310
<v Speaker 3>people still remains a call nine one one</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

2857
02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:07.570
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they just leave you out there,</v>

2858
02:08:07.571 --> 02:08:12.571
<v Speaker 3>it's like someone's gonna find you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go out there and be a </v>

2859
02:08:12.571 --> 02:08:12.571
<v Speaker 3>big investigation and you know what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>

2860
02:08:12.571 --> 02:08:17.560
<v Speaker 7>Question about finding animals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about finding dead mountain lions and </v>

2861
02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:21.490
<v Speaker 7>bears.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that because when they know they're </v>

2862
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:21.490
<v Speaker 7>going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they go somewhere and squirrely and like</v>

2863
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:21.900
<v Speaker 7>tuck away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're noticing.</v>

2864
02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:23.730
<v Speaker 7>Is that it or is it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's.</v>

2865
02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see him when you get,</v>

2866
02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:27.490
<v Speaker 3>when you get a bad hit on an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2867
02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:27.880
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2868
02:08:27.881 --> 02:08:29.530
<v Speaker 3>And you get a bad hit an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he'd go,</v>

2869
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:30.540
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if uh,</v>

2870
02:08:30.541 --> 02:08:32.530
<v Speaker 3>if you get to hit on an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bow or you know,</v>

2871
02:08:32.710 --> 02:08:37.240
<v Speaker 3>firearm and he lives beyond that initial</v>
<v Speaker 3>rush.</v>

2872
02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:40.970
<v Speaker 3>They're usually gonna die tucked away </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

2873
02:08:41.090 --> 02:08:42.510
<v Speaker 3>They go into the thick stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2874
02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:43.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>

2875
02:08:43.371 --> 02:08:48.371
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find stuff tucked up under </v>

2876
02:08:48.371 --> 02:08:48.510
<v Speaker 3>juniper's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just do this year after we went out</v>

2877
02:08:48.511 --> 02:08:51.130
<v Speaker 3>and hunted deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana and found where a,</v>

2878
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:55.260
<v Speaker 3>a really beautiful big bark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2879
02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll just happen to stumble into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had obviously I feel like he'd </v>

2880
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.050
<v Speaker 3>been hit because he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a perforated antler.</v>

2881
02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Someone had shy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2882
02:09:05.391 --> 02:09:05.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2883
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:10.990
<v Speaker 3>my take home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone had shot at him and hit that </v>

2884
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:10.990
<v Speaker 3>antler where the bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he had a,</v>

2885
02:09:11.130 --> 02:09:15.050
<v Speaker 3>he had a big bullet type wound on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>aunt or like a,</v>

2886
02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:20.080
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like would bullet hidden would but it </v>

2887
02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.050
<v Speaker 3>had cracked his skull plate so it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill them immediately.</v>

2888
02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:25.100
<v Speaker 3>But he was so tucked up under this </v>
<v Speaker 3>juniper Bush just,</v>

2889
02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:28.190
<v Speaker 3>he just laid up onto there to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he knew he was vulnerable,</v>

2890
02:09:28.490 --> 02:09:31.250
<v Speaker 3>just died up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it happens all the time,</v>

2891
02:09:31.251 --> 02:09:31.490
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2892
02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:33.090
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it seems to make sense.</v>

2893
02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:35.790
<v Speaker 7>Especially a hug cause they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 7>to get hit by a predator.</v>

2894
02:09:35.791 --> 02:09:36.840
<v Speaker 7>They know they're down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>

2895
02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:38.810
<v Speaker 7>But what about what a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like predators,</v>

2896
02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:41.520
<v Speaker 7>like bears are big cats.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2897
02:09:41.521 --> 02:09:42.760
<v Speaker 7>I've found bear,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I found</v>

2898
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:47.820
<v Speaker 3>bear schools and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never found a like a fresh dead </v>

2899
02:09:49.421 --> 02:09:52.810
<v Speaker 3>enough barrier to really tell it what </v>
<v Speaker 3>its positioning was when it was dead,</v>

2900
02:09:52.811 --> 02:09:57.811
<v Speaker 3>but I found a number of like remains of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears but never where I knew that it </v>

2901
02:09:57.811 --> 02:09:59.560
<v Speaker 3>that like this is it spot it had gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2902
02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:00.640
<v Speaker 3>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get it,</v>

2903
02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:03.820
<v Speaker 3>if you get a hit on something with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball and you don't kill me,</v>

2904
02:10:03.821 --> 02:10:08.821
<v Speaker 3>like you may be hitting liver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit it somewhere was going to live a </v>

2905
02:10:08.821 --> 02:10:08.821
<v Speaker 3>little while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you find it,</v>

2906
02:10:08.821 --> 02:10:09.970
<v Speaker 3>you'll generally find it where it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>die on the run.</v>

2907
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:12.070
<v Speaker 3>It laid down and died and when they laid</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2908
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:17.390
<v Speaker 3>they're usually pretty careful to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>tucked away somewhere when it can be </v>

2909
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.390
<v Speaker 3>tough to find stuff.</v>

2910
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:18.910
<v Speaker 7>When an animal like this diocese,</v>
<v Speaker 7>deer dies of it,</v>

2911
02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:21.130
<v Speaker 7>left his body behind would eventually </v>
<v Speaker 7>something to eat.</v>

2912
02:10:21.131 --> 02:10:22.560
<v Speaker 7>The bones of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2913
02:10:22.570 --> 02:10:22.690
<v Speaker 7>you</v>

2914
02:10:22.690 --> 02:10:27.370
<v Speaker 3>wind up with is you wind up with a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wind up with this right here.</v>

2915
02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes the base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2916
02:10:30.190 --> 02:10:33.910
<v Speaker 3>This is real thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll delete this one</v>

2917
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.430
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just,</v>

2918
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:36.830
<v Speaker 7>I remember one time for the folks at </v>
<v Speaker 7>home that are listening,</v>

2919
02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:42.010
<v Speaker 7>what would he.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about the base of a deer </v>

2920
02:10:42.010 --> 02:10:42.010
<v Speaker 7>skull,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that gets the base is the hard spot,</v>

2921
02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:45.110
<v Speaker 7>but around that frame and see that more </v>
<v Speaker 7>than anything else</v>

2922
02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you see like,</v>

2923
02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:50.340
<v Speaker 7>can I get this where you see the problem</v>
<v Speaker 7>is most people are listening and they're</v>

2924
02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:55.360
<v Speaker 7>not just people are getting this off </v>
<v Speaker 7>itunes or like listening to it on </v>

2925
02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:56.820
<v Speaker 7>Sirius.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the part on a um,</v>

2926
02:10:56.821 --> 02:10:56.840
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2927
02:10:57.670 --> 02:11:00.370
<v Speaker 3>the part you find most often when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see like a kill,</v>

2928
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:05.390
<v Speaker 3>it's been consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find where the spinal cord enters </v>

2929
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:09.451
<v Speaker 3>the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thick bone area right there </v>

2930
02:11:09.451 --> 02:11:12.811
<v Speaker 3>extending up into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the base of the antlers running </v>

2931
02:11:12.811 --> 02:11:15.270
<v Speaker 3>non antlered game around horned game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extending up to what would be kind of </v>

2932
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:18.460
<v Speaker 3>the space between the ears is just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thick and doesn't get consumed.</v>

2933
02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:22.720
<v Speaker 3>But one time I remember we killed my </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother and I killed a cow elk.</v>

2934
02:11:24.150 --> 02:11:24.820
<v Speaker 3>This is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2935
02:11:24.821 --> 02:11:29.821
<v Speaker 3>in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>southwest Montana in areas a lot of </v>

2936
02:11:29.821 --> 02:11:29.821
<v Speaker 3>grizzlies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We killed a cow elk and went back a week</v>

2937
02:11:29.821 --> 02:11:34.210
<v Speaker 3>later to see what had happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzlies had been on it.</v>

2938
02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:37.690
<v Speaker 3>They had eaten the hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2939
02:11:38.150 --> 02:11:43.150
<v Speaker 3>That eaten all the bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only part we could find was just a </v>

2940
02:11:43.150 --> 02:11:47.521
<v Speaker 3>disk of bone with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The center of the remaining piece of </v>

2941
02:11:47.621 --> 02:11:50.020
<v Speaker 3>bone was where to spinal cord passes </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the skull,</v>

2942
02:11:50.050 --> 02:11:55.050
<v Speaker 3>that heavy boned dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the frame May and I think it was worth </v>

2943
02:11:55.050 --> 02:11:57.950
<v Speaker 3>in a donut size chunk of bone like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could tell that it didn't just </v>

2944
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:59.800
<v Speaker 3>go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it wasn't like a drug.</v>

2945
02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:04.800
<v Speaker 3>It's somewhere we couldn't find it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you could account for the all </v>

2946
02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:07.060
<v Speaker 3>that hide and all that bone in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shit that was left.</v>

2947
02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:11.860
<v Speaker 3>It was all there and it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds cubs or something.</v>

2948
02:12:11.861 --> 02:12:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Got on it and it was all still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That trip we went and killed another elk</v>

2949
02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:21.950
<v Speaker 3>and pack that elk and when we went back </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there later on,</v>

2950
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000
<v Speaker 3>the same thing happened to that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it true that a grizzlies tend to </v>

2951
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:27.970
<v Speaker 3>prefer meet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of rotten to the.</v>

2952
02:12:28.110 --> 02:12:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say like when it kills something,</v>

2953
02:12:31.330 --> 02:12:34.990
<v Speaker 3>when people watch a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black bear or grizzly make a kill,</v>

2954
02:12:34.991 --> 02:12:39.991
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat that soft tissue first so </v>

2955
02:12:39.991 --> 02:12:39.991
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rip his belly open,</v>

2956
02:12:39.991 --> 02:12:40.630
<v Speaker 3>lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>

2957
02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:43.600
<v Speaker 3>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and generally it's like they'll,</v>

2958
02:12:43.601 --> 02:12:47.200
<v Speaker 3>what they'll do is when they covered </v>
<v Speaker 3>with grass,</v>

2959
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:52.500
<v Speaker 3>some people even say that somehow and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>covered a little bit of dirt or covered </v>

2960
02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:52.600
<v Speaker 3>in grass aids decomposition.</v>

2961
02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll lay around on it,</v>

2962
02:12:55.930 --> 02:12:57.780
<v Speaker 3>they dedicate on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2963
02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:00.930
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll eat it as bacteria.</v>

2964
02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:02.020
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

2965
02:13:02.021 --> 02:13:07.021
<v Speaker 3>Generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't generally kill it and </v>

2966
02:13:07.021 --> 02:13:08.440
<v Speaker 3>immediately started eating red meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>alliance differently.</v>

2967
02:13:08.441 --> 02:13:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Lions don't like all that rotten meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

2968
02:13:10.361 --> 02:13:12.190
<v Speaker 3>like fresh stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the bears like,</v>

2969
02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:15.250
<v Speaker 3>bears like pretty like pretty rotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2970
02:13:15.251 --> 02:13:16.040
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2971
02:13:16.060 --> 02:13:17.840
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being again,</v>

2972
02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:23.060
<v Speaker 3>we're remember what we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were hunting for something or </v>

2973
02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:23.260
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on Prince of Wales Island,</v>

2974
02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:26.440
<v Speaker 3>am I the shack we own?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching the wolves.</v>

2975
02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:28.930
<v Speaker 3>You think a wolves like eating fresh </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat everyday.</v>

2976
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:33.970
<v Speaker 3>You will throughout the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes pounds of meat a day to keep </v>

2977
02:13:33.970 --> 02:13:34.950
<v Speaker 3>that thing alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we sat there watching,</v>

2978
02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:38.790
<v Speaker 3>we sat there watching for wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating salmon.</v>

2979
02:13:38.791 --> 02:13:43.791
<v Speaker 3>This is after the spawning room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't a fall and they're eating </v>

2980
02:13:43.791 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 3>salmon that are so rotten that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a putting like consistency of putting</v>

2981
02:13:46.081 --> 02:13:51.081
<v Speaker 3>lake state and just putrid like I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even imagine like putrid,</v>

2982
02:13:52.561 --> 02:13:57.561
<v Speaker 3>like it would take it if you walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>through one of these areas that one of </v>

2983
02:13:57.561 --> 02:13:58.470
<v Speaker 3>these stream miles where all these sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're laying dead.</v>

2984
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 3>I have a strong stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

2985
02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I would need an hour or two before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could eat.</v>

2986
02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just overpowering and watching </v>

2987
02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:10.740
<v Speaker 3>these wolves basically lapping up San </v>
<v Speaker 3>and soup,</v>

2988
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:13.740
<v Speaker 3>putting like salmon or Ryan to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting leg and says,</v>

2989
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.950
<v Speaker 3>I can try to be an animal as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2990
02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:19.560
<v Speaker 3>try to think like an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An animal becomes animalistic.</v>

2991
02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Now you need serious enzymes in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach and mouth to handle that.</v>

2992
02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Not get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it's a mystery there.</v>

2993
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Like the cleanup crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bears,</v>

2994
02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:35.310
<v Speaker 3>like the cleanup crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bones like that.</v>

2995
02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Just eat everything swelled to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hiring.</v>

2996
02:14:39.581 --> 02:14:40.450
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a,</v>

2997
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:44.330
<v Speaker 3>there's a relationship that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>

2998
02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:48.300
<v Speaker 3>an Africa between like Cheetahs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyenas where she doesn't make a kill,</v>

2999
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:53.330
<v Speaker 3>they can't cross the bone and in Hyannis</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go in and hang out and wait because </v>

3000
02:14:54.091 --> 02:14:59.091
<v Speaker 3>they know that when that's done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be the first in their nose and </v>

3001
02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:00.030
<v Speaker 3>they can crush bones and I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this theory is in in,</v>

3002
02:15:00.031 --> 02:15:05.031
<v Speaker 3>in fashion anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it used to be in fashion that early </v>

3003
02:15:05.031 --> 02:15:09.561
<v Speaker 3>hominids like early humans seem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appear in the fossil record outside of </v>

3004
02:15:11.731 --> 02:15:16.731
<v Speaker 3>Africa at a time that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>contemporaneous with the appearance of </v>

3005
02:15:17.011 --> 02:15:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Saber tooth cats.</v>

3006
02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:24.140
<v Speaker 3>The thinking being that that the saber </v>
<v Speaker 3>tooth cats weren't able to crush bone </v>

3007
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:26.290
<v Speaker 3>because of the makeup of their dental </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>

3008
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't crush bone and they were </v>

3009
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:33.531
<v Speaker 3>really effective predators and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have become a cost on the following </v>

3010
02:15:33.531 --> 02:15:35.880
<v Speaker 3>saber tooth cats to scavenge bone marrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things that they left behind.</v>

3011
02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I read this long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's been hard,</v>

3012
02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:42.320
<v Speaker 3>but other funds can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3013
02:15:42.321 --> 02:15:47.321
<v Speaker 3>but I mean just that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're leaving kills out there and if </v>

3014
02:15:47.321 --> 02:15:48.330
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're the term Apex Predator,</v>

3015
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:51.360
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of benefits to being the </v>
<v Speaker 3>apex scavenger,</v>

3016
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:56.250
<v Speaker 3>which is after the top dog does what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to do.</v>

3017
02:15:56.251 --> 02:15:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Who gets to be there first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3018
02:15:58.171 --> 02:15:59.850
<v Speaker 3>How much can they eat of an elk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3019
02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:01.950
<v Speaker 3>So like the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kyla,</v>

3020
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.810
<v Speaker 3>if wolves kill an elk and get what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want off.</v>

3021
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:09.860
<v Speaker 3>It was a big benefit to whoever comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>along behind who's ever the second roll </v>

3022
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:15.270
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the little guys that come </v>

3023
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.270
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3024
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Little guys later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But first it was like a coyote hang in </v>

3025
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.310
<v Speaker 3>there and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's done,</v>

3026
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm in there man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you guys get in line behind me.</v>

3027
02:16:19.651 --> 02:16:24.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating that there's a balance </v>

3028
02:16:24.651 --> 02:16:24.651
<v Speaker 3>of that system that the wolves want the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh meat,</v>

3029
02:16:24.651 --> 02:16:25.330
<v Speaker 3>but the bears want the rotten meat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3030
02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:30.210
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how the system is covered.</v>

3031
02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Got All the bases covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3032
02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the area where we were,</v>

3033
02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:38.920
<v Speaker 1>the breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Missouri River was like the most </v>

3034
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:41.230
<v Speaker 1>hostile place for life I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3035
02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I've ever been</v>

3036
02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:46.670
<v Speaker 3>to be cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wickedly hot and not much to eat.</v>

3037
02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're people that it was a place for </v>

3038
02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:52.790
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a place for carnivores,</v>

3039
02:16:52.791 --> 02:16:53.360
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3040
02:16:53.361 --> 02:16:55.160
<v Speaker 3>There's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some edible wild plants,</v>

3041
02:16:55.161 --> 02:16:57.960
<v Speaker 3>but the people in there would go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and in,</v>

3042
02:16:57.980 --> 02:16:58.530
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3043
02:16:58.850 --> 02:17:00.050
<v Speaker 3>in a historical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

3044
02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lewis and Clark went through there and </v>

3045
02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:06.470
<v Speaker 3>generally people traveling through there</v>
<v Speaker 3>would um,</v>

3046
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:11.420
<v Speaker 3>have fantastic luck with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3047
02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:14.000
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still got a lot of animals today,</v>

3048
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:17.480
<v Speaker 3>but something about that river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just game down there,</v>

3049
02:17:17.481 --> 02:17:18.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things went through there.</v>

3050
02:17:18.771 --> 02:17:22.010
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of water in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's reliable place to find water.</v>

3051
02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:25.370
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great place for hunting and other</v>

3052
02:17:25.371 --> 02:17:30.371
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of agricultural practices and </v>

3053
02:17:30.371 --> 02:17:30.371
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so great and it's always been,</v>

3054
02:17:30.371 --> 02:17:31.760
<v Speaker 3>it's always been a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a place for hunter gathers.</v>

3055
02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:36.880
<v Speaker 1>You weren't clued me into what it used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be that it used to be a gigantic </v>

3056
02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:40.151
<v Speaker 1>ocean and now that is really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard of them finding a fossilized,</v>

3057
02:17:41.001 --> 02:17:46.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient teeth of different fish and I </v>

3058
02:17:46.001 --> 02:17:48.281
<v Speaker 1>think one of the shells we were fine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was convinced it was a mining </v>

3059
02:17:48.471 --> 02:17:53.471
<v Speaker 1>operation was dead serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like see those hills that's reminding.</v>

3060
02:17:54.170 --> 02:17:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3061
02:17:55.041 --> 02:17:57.930
<v Speaker 1>this river here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that run over here,</v>

3062
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:59.800
<v Speaker 1>the mining expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian County,</v>

3063
02:17:59.930 --> 02:18:02.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a classic example of me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little excited.</v>

3064
02:18:02.331 --> 02:18:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everything.</v>

3065
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Those are track marks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3066
02:18:05.570 --> 02:18:06.460
<v Speaker 1>But it is interesting too</v>

3067
02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:11.490
<v Speaker 3>called the breaks because it was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the bench of the Great Plains </v>

3068
02:18:11.851 --> 02:18:16.851
<v Speaker 3>in the Missouri breaks is where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape seems to break and crumble </v>

3069
02:18:16.851 --> 02:18:21.571
<v Speaker 3>away down into the canyon and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Missouri River and it's just like deeply</v>

3070
02:18:23.681 --> 02:18:25.030
<v Speaker 3>incised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3071
02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

3072
02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fascinating place,</v>

3073
02:18:27.191 --> 02:18:29.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what the folks don't.</v>

3074
02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:34.080
<v Speaker 1>If you don't see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these grey hills and it's </v>

3075
02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:35.830
<v Speaker 1>basically these gigantic mountains of </v>
<v Speaker 1>silt.</v>

3076
02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>And what's really weird is there's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>patches of timber and stuff inside of </v>

3077
02:18:41.130 --> 02:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you're climbing it,</v>

3078
02:18:41.130 --> 02:18:45.820
<v Speaker 1>like especially after it's rained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all mud clay.</v>

3079
02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird heavy clays.</v>

3080
02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:49.850
<v Speaker 3>They call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an expandable clay.</v>

3081
02:18:49.851 --> 02:18:54.851
<v Speaker 3>It gets wet and swells and it does seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd look at it like you look at the </v>

3082
02:18:54.851 --> 02:18:57.710
<v Speaker 3>brakes from the water and it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the term loosely,</v>

3083
02:18:57.711 --> 02:18:59.570
<v Speaker 3>but it feels like you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains mountainous,</v>

3084
02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:01.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost like the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>

3085
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Mountains would be something that rose </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the geologic pressures.</v>

3086
02:19:05.541 --> 02:19:08.030
<v Speaker 3>It pushed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the breaks is the absence of.</v>

3087
02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:13.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like the absence of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of topsoil is something was like washed </v>

3088
02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:14.240
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the Grand Canyon,</v>

3089
02:19:14.241 --> 02:19:16.280
<v Speaker 3>like the Grand Canyon is a very rugged </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

3090
02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:18.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's just because you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that you add in stuff,</v>

3091
02:19:18.411 --> 02:19:22.250
<v Speaker 3>you took stuff away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't climb that stuff like I eat.</v>

3092
02:19:22.670 --> 02:19:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I looked back at how much ground me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ryan had covered.</v>

3093
02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 3>It was like a lot like even be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem</v>

3094
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:32.980
<v Speaker 5>like climbing to the top of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain or whatever it was in front of </v>

3095
02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:33.350
<v Speaker 5>you and you could because you could get </v>
<v Speaker 5>a foothold that way.</v>

3096
02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:39.560
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things that I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>realized how difficult it is to actually</v>

3097
02:19:39.561 --> 02:19:43.130
<v Speaker 5>keep warm unless you're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you start moving,</v>

3098
02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:45.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're outside,</v>

3099
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:46.430
<v Speaker 5>it kicks your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3100
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:48.190
<v Speaker 5>did you spend a lot of time cold or are </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3101
02:19:48.191 --> 02:19:49.440
<v Speaker 5>you seem like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3102
02:19:49.450 --> 02:19:51.080
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get cold and that's the thing.</v>

3103
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:53.900
<v Speaker 5>That's just a basic survival element</v>

3104
02:19:54.890 --> 02:19:55.250
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

3105
02:19:57.130 --> 02:20:01.520
<v Speaker 5>it's like when you're out and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditions are poor and you have,</v>

3106
02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:04.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially cold with some humidity.</v>

3107
02:20:04.321 --> 02:20:09.321
<v Speaker 5>Like it was overcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a little bit wet feeling even </v>

3108
02:20:09.321 --> 02:20:09.321
<v Speaker 5>though it's a very arid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dry area,</v>

3109
02:20:09.321 --> 02:20:09.920
<v Speaker 5>it was a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of humidity on a trip.</v>

3110
02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:13.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just like the only time you were in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your out and moving.</v>

3111
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:18.910
<v Speaker 5>But it's a little bit paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 5>because when you get cold and </v>

3112
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:21.780
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your inclination is to huddle into </v>

3113
02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:21.780
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3114
02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:24.350
<v Speaker 5>And so it's like harder to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your bag in the morning.</v>

3115
02:20:24.610 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 5>You're kind of like paralyzed by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cold and paralyzed by the young,</v>

3116
02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:32.860
<v Speaker 5>like how uncomfortable you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you'll notice that the minute you </v>

3117
02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:35.291
<v Speaker 5>start hiking up a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel great and you can be out there </v>

3118
02:20:35.291 --> 02:20:37.610
<v Speaker 5>all day and you're having a good time </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you stopped and you feel like hell.</v>

3119
02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:39.310
<v Speaker 5>And when you feel like hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets.</v>

3120
02:20:39.311 --> 02:20:41.310
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to get motivated to do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

3121
02:20:41.311 --> 02:20:46.311
<v Speaker 5>And I think that something that comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>from spending a lot of time on </v>

3122
02:20:46.311 --> 02:20:48.960
<v Speaker 5>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just you get in your head that you </v>

3123
02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:48.960
<v Speaker 5>just got to move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3124
02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:50.660
<v Speaker 5>and I think that when it's really cold </v>
<v Speaker 5>weather,</v>

3125
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:52.370
<v Speaker 5>you try not to do anything.</v>

3126
02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:58.140
<v Speaker 5>Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get up in the morning and you go </v>

3127
02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:58.140
<v Speaker 5>immediately from your sleeping bag to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>moving.</v>

3128
02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:59.260
<v Speaker 5>When it's time to eat you to stop for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute and eat while moving.</v>

3129
02:20:59.261 --> 02:21:03.870
<v Speaker 5>You never stopped for mealtime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You this man,</v>

3130
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:06.360
<v Speaker 5>the only way you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal with over time,</v>

3131
02:21:06.370 --> 02:21:08.280
<v Speaker 5>you'll feel cold and you feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>

3132
02:21:08.650 --> 02:21:13.650
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 5>when we did this trip was that I was </v>

3133
02:21:13.650 --> 02:21:16.771
<v Speaker 5>never like tired during the day or I </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to take a nap or something very </v>

3134
02:21:16.771 --> 02:21:21.150
<v Speaker 5>different than the um.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the idea of getting up in the </v>

3135
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:24.421
<v Speaker 5>morning and just hiking around all day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet all the time completely alert </v>

3136
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:28.030
<v Speaker 5>all the time completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we were wide awake.</v>

3137
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.450
<v Speaker 5>Whereas like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3138
02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:34.520
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a regular job or whatever you </v>

3139
02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:34.520
<v Speaker 5>do after five or six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3140
02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:34.860
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get me the fuck outta here.</v>

3141
02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:39.070
<v Speaker 5>You start yawning and stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't ever feel like I needed to take</v>

3142
02:21:39.071 --> 02:21:42.010
<v Speaker 5>a nap and we got to this really weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular cycle.</v>

3143
02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:45.040
<v Speaker 5>We're going to bed at like 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that will go right to sleep.</v>

3144
02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:50.460
<v Speaker 5>And I'd wake up early and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like this weird sort of natural </v>

3145
02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:54.091
<v Speaker 5>cycle that you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First time we'd ever been living by </v>

3146
02:21:54.091 --> 02:21:54.091
<v Speaker 5>natural light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>natural light,</v>

3147
02:21:54.091 --> 02:21:57.430
<v Speaker 5>but we weren't around any of our beeping</v>
<v Speaker 5>gadgets.</v>

3148
02:21:57.490 --> 02:21:59.470
<v Speaker 5>Not Wonder fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

3149
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:01.820
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a huge part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3150
02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:03.340
<v Speaker 5>I think you find something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3151
02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean just think about just in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a setting like how much we were just </v>

3152
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:13.330
<v Speaker 5>like our physical beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're shaped by that lifestyle,</v>

3153
02:22:13.710 --> 02:22:14.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

3154
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:16.660
<v Speaker 5>of operating according to daylight </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>

3155
02:22:16.810 --> 02:22:18.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being out in search of food.</v>

3156
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:19.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3157
02:22:19.871 --> 02:22:20.280
<v Speaker 5>To get out like,</v>

3158
02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:22.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3159
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:28.630
<v Speaker 5>new age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't don't mean to get all like </v>

3160
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.630
<v Speaker 5>nostalgia</v>

3161
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.630
<v Speaker 3>and new age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are good words for it,</v>

3162
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:31.530
<v Speaker 3>but when you're out doing that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

3163
02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:33.750
<v Speaker 3>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like hunting on the land,</v>

3164
02:22:33.751 --> 02:22:35.940
<v Speaker 3>using your senses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for food,</v>

3165
02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:39.870
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start making sense to yourself,</v>

3166
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>

3167
02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:47.180
<v Speaker 3>you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's safe to say that there's something </v>

3168
02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:47.180
<v Speaker 3>about me that really thrives on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3169
02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:49.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's something about me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just likes this kind of energy.</v>

3170
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I think most people find it</v>

3171
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:55.190
<v Speaker 7>primal thing that's just ingrained in </v>
<v Speaker 7>our system that from the hunter gatherer</v>

3172
02:22:55.191 --> 02:22:57.710
<v Speaker 7>days of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or it's like all a part of us.</v>

3173
02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:59.210
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3174
02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:01.050
<v Speaker 3>just think about what we know about just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3175
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:03.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selective pressures.</v>

3176
02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:08.180
<v Speaker 3>There's an enormous amount of selective </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure and being able to do that kind </v>

3177
02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:09.210
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that now people would argue that</v>

3178
02:23:09.250 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 3>the new life we have now in technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were under new kinds of selective </v>

3179
02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 3>pressures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3180
02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:16.710
<v Speaker 3>there's probably right now those of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are going to thrive,</v>

3181
02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:18.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3182
02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:20.520
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are going to thrive or are adapted</v>

3183
02:23:20.521 --> 02:23:22.370
<v Speaker 3>to a technological society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now it's not,</v>

3184
02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:24.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not tied in now to birth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3185
02:23:24.561 --> 02:23:28.500
<v Speaker 3>it used to be that we had such low life </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectancies and high mortality rates.</v>

3186
02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people that could thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good hunters were the ones that </v>

3187
02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:34.380
<v Speaker 3>were having that access to females.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had young.</v>

3188
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Now it's kind of a given that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have reproductive </v>

3189
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:40.880
<v Speaker 3>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3190
02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:46.020
<v Speaker 3>you'd be the biggest loser in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not do anything and you still get </v>

3191
02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:49.251
<v Speaker 3>people pregnant and have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that selective pressures </v>

3192
02:23:49.251 --> 02:23:49.251
<v Speaker 3>don't work on this now like they used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3193
02:23:49.251 --> 02:23:51.680
<v Speaker 3>but for a long time we are shaped by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3194
02:23:51.681 --> 02:23:55.650
<v Speaker 3>you had to be a productive member of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your culture.</v>

3195
02:23:55.651 --> 02:24:00.651
<v Speaker 3>You had to be a productive member of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your clan in order to have the kind of </v>

3196
02:24:00.651 --> 02:24:00.990
<v Speaker 3>cache that was necessary to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breed women.</v>

3197
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:05.600
<v Speaker 7>When I lived in Massachusetts was my </v>
<v Speaker 7>fishing phase phase.</v>

3198
02:24:05.601 --> 02:24:07.040
<v Speaker 7>My childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go fishing everyday.</v>

3199
02:24:07.090 --> 02:24:09.950
<v Speaker 7>It was a member of the Bass Angler </v>
<v Speaker 7>Sportsman Society,</v>

3200
02:24:09.951 --> 02:24:14.951
<v Speaker 7>the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I spent all my free time fishing for a </v>

3201
02:24:14.951 --> 02:24:14.951
<v Speaker 7>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Loved it,</v>

3202
02:24:14.951 --> 02:24:19.720
<v Speaker 7>and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's some fucking visceral thrill I </v>

3203
02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:21.710
<v Speaker 7>think of hooking one of my first fishes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fishes.</v>

3204
02:24:21.711 --> 02:24:22.790
<v Speaker 7>I said fishes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fish,</v>

3205
02:24:22.791 --> 02:24:24.140
<v Speaker 7>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know what it is,</v>

3206
02:24:24.141 --> 02:24:28.670
<v Speaker 7>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the though that visceral thrill,</v>

3207
02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:33.700
<v Speaker 7>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was so shocking to me that to this </v>

3208
02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:35.630
<v Speaker 7>day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I'll look back and think of that.</v>

3209
02:24:35.631 --> 02:24:40.631
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's got to be some like ancient DNA </v>

3210
02:24:40.631 --> 02:24:40.950
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like he got the fish was like,</v>

3211
02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:43.410
<v Speaker 7>you don't know what's going to come </v>
<v Speaker 7>around the next corner.</v>

3212
02:24:43.411 --> 02:24:48.411
<v Speaker 7>And when I saw my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was the third day I got so </v>

3213
02:24:48.411 --> 02:24:49.790
<v Speaker 7>excited because it from where I looked </v>
<v Speaker 7>at,</v>

3214
02:24:49.791 --> 02:24:54.350
<v Speaker 7>it looked like it was a world record </v>
<v Speaker 7>bucket at 50 point bucks.</v>

3215
02:24:54.380 --> 02:24:59.380
<v Speaker 7>Literally I went,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was at a buck because buck and I had </v>

3216
02:24:59.380 --> 02:24:59.450
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had nothing in my scope and it was,</v>

3217
02:24:59.451 --> 02:25:04.451
<v Speaker 7>my scope was moving around so much </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I got so heated and adrenaline </v>

3218
02:25:04.451 --> 02:25:06.920
<v Speaker 7>up that I had buck fever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could not shoot that deer.</v>

3219
02:25:06.980 --> 02:25:07.750
<v Speaker 7>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

3220
02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:09.370
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ryan had to grab it.</v>

3221
02:25:09.371 --> 02:25:14.371
<v Speaker 7>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to injure a dog because I </v>

3222
02:25:14.371 --> 02:25:14.371
<v Speaker 7>was going to start squeezing rounds off </v>
<v Speaker 7>blindly,</v>

3223
02:25:14.371 --> 02:25:15.110
<v Speaker 7>which is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I was so excited.</v>

3224
02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:17.450
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you get addicted to that.</v>

3225
02:25:17.451 --> 02:25:18.980
<v Speaker 7>Not only I have the other thing you </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to take the two.</v>

3226
02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:20.780
<v Speaker 7>I think when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you glass,</v>

3227
02:25:20.930 --> 02:25:24.000
<v Speaker 7>when you take your binoculars and you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>looking out and for like an antler and</v>

3228
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:29.010
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start looking at things </v>

3229
02:25:29.010 --> 02:25:30.280
<v Speaker 1>more intensely and differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have almost new eyes,</v>

3230
02:25:30.281 --> 02:25:32.350
<v Speaker 1>like you're looking at things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3231
02:25:32.351 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 1>the way you don't usually look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3232
02:25:34.310 --> 02:25:38.080
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to everything and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that keeps you in a keys.</v>

3233
02:25:38.081 --> 02:25:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

3234
02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:41.170
<v Speaker 1>you start forgetting about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of refreshing</v>

3235
02:25:41.310 --> 02:25:41.810
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3236
02:25:41.811 --> 02:25:46.811
<v Speaker 3>You seize the t to look to look out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be on the look for game like you're </v>

3237
02:25:46.811 --> 02:25:51.811
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sense where you're looking for deer </v>

3238
02:25:51.811 --> 02:25:51.811
<v Speaker 3>but use everything starts to pop to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3239
02:25:51.811 --> 02:25:53.050
<v Speaker 3>because you're paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3240
02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:54.850
<v Speaker 3>It also thing I think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

3241
02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:59.880
<v Speaker 3>like in a place like the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is because of the landscape might </v>

3242
02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:02.860
<v Speaker 3>seem to some people redundant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3243
02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:06.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like a lot of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like roll upon row upon row of</v>

3244
02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.000
<v Speaker 3>a hill that looks this way and sandstone</v>
<v Speaker 3>bluffs and it's like everything looks </v>

3245
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.751
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you're looking for through all </v>

3246
02:26:15.751 --> 02:26:15.751
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like little subtle differences</v>

3247
02:26:15.751 --> 02:26:20.191
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's like the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity that sometimes helps you hone </v>

3248
02:26:20.441 --> 02:26:22.150
<v Speaker 3>in and look at things much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>carefully.</v>

3249
02:26:22.470 --> 02:26:27.470
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever notice if you walk into a </v>

3250
02:26:27.470 --> 02:26:27.790
<v Speaker 3>really crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shopping center,</v>

3251
02:26:27.791 --> 02:26:28.800
<v Speaker 3>walk into like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3252
02:26:28.801 --> 02:26:30.760
<v Speaker 3>you're going to like walk through times </v>
<v Speaker 3>square or something.</v>

3253
02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:36.120
<v Speaker 3>You get to the other end and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes realize that you didn't ever </v>

3254
02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 3>actually really look at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3255
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Because you were just in a miller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so much you came away with </v>

3256
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:42.580
<v Speaker 3>impressions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a sense of noise,</v>

3257
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:44.680
<v Speaker 3>a sense of what you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like snippets,</v>

3258
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:49.950
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing that you ever like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like detailed in on it and when you're </v>

3259
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:53.671
<v Speaker 3>in those places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would argue that like the Arctic </v>

3260
02:26:53.671 --> 02:26:53.671
<v Speaker 3>is a little bit this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3261
02:26:53.671 --> 02:26:55.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas of Montana this way.</v>

3262
02:26:55.090 --> 02:26:57.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a place that people might</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at and be like,</v>

3263
02:26:57.521 --> 02:26:58.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just nothing.</v>

3264
02:26:58.940 --> 02:26:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Just grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3265
02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:02.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when there's a deer out on that,</v>

3266
02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:06.070
<v Speaker 3>you can focus in on that thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that thing in a way that you</v>

3267
02:27:06.071 --> 02:27:06.880
<v Speaker 3>just don't get to do,</v>

3268
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:12.070
<v Speaker 1>to an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between a human life </v>

3269
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:16.300
<v Speaker 1>living and walking through a mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That experience and the human out there </v>

3270
02:27:16.971 --> 02:27:21.971
<v Speaker 1>on the brakes and the Missouri breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to talk about two </v>

3271
02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:21.971
<v Speaker 1>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3272
02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:24.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Enrica says that he thinks that part</v>

3273
02:27:24.130 --> 02:27:29.130
<v Speaker 1>of part of maybe the epidemic of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are have hyper vigilant a central </v>

3274
02:27:29.130 --> 02:27:33.341
<v Speaker 1>nervous systems and our become like </v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly autistic might be that we're </v>

3275
02:27:33.341 --> 02:27:36.320
<v Speaker 1>evolving because human beings today </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience more stimulus in one day than</v>

3276
02:27:36.321 --> 02:27:38.660
<v Speaker 1>they did in a lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only makes sense.</v>

3277
02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How else could you process the </v>

3278
02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:45.380
<v Speaker 1>information that just comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>television?</v>

3279
02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:46.190
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3280
02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:48.710
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you design to really see?</v>

3281
02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You're not really designed to sit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a fucking television take in </v>

3282
02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

3283
02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:56.540
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not really designed for that.</v>

3284
02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:01.720
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these signals that are firing off </v>

3285
02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:02.640
<v Speaker 1>your reward systems and getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dopamine levels and your.</v>

3286
02:28:02.641 --> 02:28:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Your adrenaline levels up and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting engaged in the action.</v>

3287
02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:07.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

3288
02:28:07.890 --> 02:28:11.240
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like it's a step away from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simulated reality,</v>

3289
02:28:11.241 --> 02:28:12.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's really moving in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

3290
02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:17.980
<v Speaker 1>You get these gigantic thrill rushes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a giant television.</v>

3291
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:20.150
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird stuff.</v>

3292
02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:22.340
<v Speaker 1>When you stop and think the impact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has</v>

3293
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:27.550
<v Speaker 7>on the way we visualize our world </v>
<v Speaker 7>because so many people visualize their </v>

3294
02:28:28.041 --> 02:28:30.410
<v Speaker 7>world as if it's some sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 7>plot and a movie.</v>

3295
02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:33.630
<v Speaker 7>They see the whole thing like a plot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the movie.</v>

3296
02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:34.520
<v Speaker 7>When you're.</v>

3297
02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Did we talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about the Uda bombers </v>

3298
02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:43.091
<v Speaker 3>manifesto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting elements that I remember I </v>

3299
02:28:43.091 --> 02:28:44.590
<v Speaker 3>took this class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took this class in college called the,</v>

3300
02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called political </v>
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric.</v>

3301
02:28:47.391 --> 02:28:52.391
<v Speaker 3>We read various pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything from Martin Luther King that </v>

3302
02:28:52.391 --> 02:28:53.350
<v Speaker 3>the unibomber and everybody had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point that I messed up.</v>

3303
02:28:53.351 --> 02:28:55.070
<v Speaker 3>This guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had just pointed out as resonate with</v>

3304
02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:58.260
<v Speaker 3>me where he talks about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he.</v>

3305
02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:01.550
<v Speaker 3>He looked at levels of difficulty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be.</v>

3306
02:29:01.551 --> 02:29:03.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what way it went if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>went up or down,</v>

3307
02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:05.900
<v Speaker 3>but let's just say as level one </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty was like,</v>

3308
02:29:05.930 --> 02:29:07.400
<v Speaker 3>no matter how hard you try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll fail.</v>

3309
02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's absolute difficult.</v>

3310
02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:12.110
<v Speaker 3>That'd be level two is like if you try </v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

3311
02:29:12.111 --> 02:29:17.111
<v Speaker 3>super hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a slight chance of success on </v>

3312
02:29:17.111 --> 02:29:18.110
<v Speaker 3>down to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't try it all,</v>

3313
02:29:18.111 --> 02:29:19.510
<v Speaker 3>you're still succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3314
02:29:19.511 --> 02:29:21.950
<v Speaker 3>it would be like these five levels of </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty and he's like,</v>

3315
02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:26.440
<v Speaker 3>his gripe with technology was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology had brought human existence,</v>

3316
02:29:26.441 --> 02:29:27.530
<v Speaker 3>tilt to the level five.</v>

3317
02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:30.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't even have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeed.</v>

3318
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:32.350
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to be alive now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're gonna,</v>

3319
02:29:32.351 --> 02:29:33.770
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will reproduce.</v>

3320
02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:37.130
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just you're just taking care of.</v>

3321
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:40.970
<v Speaker 3>We've got food surpluses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social safety nets,</v>

3322
02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:41.480
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3323
02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:44.070
<v Speaker 3>and he argued that Omar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our,</v>

3324
02:29:44.390 --> 02:29:49.390
<v Speaker 3>as neurotic as he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he argued that all of our neuroses came </v>

3325
02:29:49.390 --> 02:29:52.691
<v Speaker 3>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the energy we're supposed to be </v>

3326
02:29:52.691 --> 02:29:53.420
<v Speaker 3>spending to maybe survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3327
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:57.710
<v Speaker 3>was just now spent running a muck in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

3328
02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.680
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't handle the free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't handle the free time the </v>

3329
02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:06.941
<v Speaker 3>technology allows us and that's why he </v>
<v Speaker 3>advocated for like this human being's </v>

3330
02:30:06.941 --> 02:30:09.820
<v Speaker 3>definitely this reactionary existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you can go back to like,</v>

3331
02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:12.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an agrarian environment.</v>

3332
02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just</v>

3333
02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:16.170
<v Speaker 7>try to get your black belt in Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>

3334
02:30:16.310 --> 02:30:19.200
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The goals.</v>

3335
02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:21.710
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You need tasks,</v>

3336
02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:24.980
<v Speaker 7>you need things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm most happy when I'm going like this.</v>

3337
02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:28.280
<v Speaker 7>That's what I'm most happy when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>going,</v>

3338
02:30:28.740 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not involved in something or </v>

3339
02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 7>something's not stimulating me if </v>
<v Speaker 7>something's not,</v>

3340
02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:36.050
<v Speaker 7>whether it's training,</v>
<v Speaker 7>doing something different,</v>

3341
02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:41.080
<v Speaker 7>trying something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The hunting experience was a perfect </v>

3342
02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:43.721
<v Speaker 7>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like the ability to to go and do the </v>

3343
02:30:44.301 --> 02:30:49.301
<v Speaker 7>show and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you guys brought to the table with so </v>

3344
02:30:49.301 --> 02:30:51.050
<v Speaker 7>much better than anything we could have </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever come up with on our own.</v>

3345
02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:55.580
<v Speaker 7>I mean the idea that you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>take us in this fucking five day camping</v>

3346
02:30:55.581 --> 02:30:59.050
<v Speaker 7>thing with no cell phones and no </v>
<v Speaker 7>Internet connection and you know,</v>

3347
02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:04.060
<v Speaker 7>that's completely different than </v>
<v Speaker 7>anything we would have ever done if we </v>

3348
02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:04.060
<v Speaker 7>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

3349
02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:04.060
<v Speaker 7>let's go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What do you want?</v>

3350
02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:04.640
<v Speaker 7>We would have probably going to hire </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody.</v>

3351
02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:09.990
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we both caught it was time to go </v>

3352
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:09.990
<v Speaker 7>home.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

3353
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.130
<v Speaker 7>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's go eat.</v>

3354
02:31:10.131 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 7>Let's go get some steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So glad we did and I'm so glad.</v>

3355
02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:14.420
<v Speaker 7>Looking back on it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ms Dot took five days.</v>

3356
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:19.450
<v Speaker 7>The first day we get there pouring rain </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I knew it was fucking for real when </v>

3357
02:31:19.450 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 7>we stopped at</v>

3358
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of the spots where Lewis and </v>

3359
02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Clark camped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

3360
02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense of history at all </v>

3361
02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:32.841
<v Speaker 1>and you sort of trying to take this in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how bizarre it really is at several</v>

3362
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:37.110
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago before the invention </v>
<v Speaker 1>of radio and the camera,</v>

3363
02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>there were some fucking people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling across the entire river.</v>

3364
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:46.910
<v Speaker 1>They were going down the Missouri River.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were traveling across the whole </v>

3365
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:48.690
<v Speaker 1>country and they were right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>camping where you're going to camp</v>

3366
02:31:48.850 --> 02:31:53.850
<v Speaker 3>and it's still like there's some notable</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are different but it still </v>

3367
02:31:53.850 --> 02:31:56.260
<v Speaker 3>is kind of like very reminiscent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a friend who does a writer.</v>

3368
02:31:56.261 --> 02:31:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I've always admired a lot that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>writer,</v>

3369
02:31:57.701 --> 02:32:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Ian Frazier and he's written a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American west and,</v>

3370
02:32:02.450 --> 02:32:05.190
<v Speaker 3>and we were on that river one time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just saying like,</v>

3371
02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:07.600
<v Speaker 3>he just likes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it happened.</v>

3372
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:13.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Lewis and Clark came here and </v>

3373
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.110
<v Speaker 3>camped here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like.</v>

3374
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:15.190
<v Speaker 3>And then nothing ever really happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>

3375
02:32:15.730 --> 02:32:17.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I think about that,</v>

3376
02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:20.230
<v Speaker 3>I'll point out you can go to site so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can go to places.</v>

3377
02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:23.380
<v Speaker 3>I was at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one time I was 20 because I was on</v>

3378
02:32:23.381 --> 02:32:25.120
<v Speaker 3>the phone with innovation one time </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll sell them.</v>

3379
02:32:25.121 --> 02:32:25.840
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you?</v>

3380
02:32:25.841 --> 02:32:30.841
<v Speaker 3>And I was in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were trying to meet up and I </v>

3381
02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:30.841
<v Speaker 3>explained to him that I was out in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this bar,</v>

3382
02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>like the white horse or something.</v>

3383
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:32.020
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3384
02:32:32.021 --> 02:32:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Dylan Thomas Drank himself to death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>died,</v>

3385
02:32:34.331 --> 02:32:34.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>

3386
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>what corner you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3387
02:32:35.861 --> 02:32:38.200
<v Speaker 3>well I'm at this and such in that booth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3388
02:32:38.201 --> 02:32:38.560
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3389
02:32:38.561 --> 02:32:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Dylan Thomas collapse like drain stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The debt there.</v>

3390
02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:44.470
<v Speaker 3>And I was wondering anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3391
02:32:44.471 --> 02:32:45.190
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

3392
02:32:45.430 --> 02:32:47.740
<v Speaker 3>But then you think like all the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that happened,</v>

3393
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:49.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get hit by cars and like,</v>

3394
02:32:50.250 --> 02:32:55.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people getting broken up with and </v>

3395
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:57.420
<v Speaker 3>falling in love and like all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>layers upon layers of other activities </v>

3396
02:32:57.420 --> 02:32:58.570
<v Speaker 3>that went on there in some way dilutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3397
02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:00.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes hard to picture.</v>

3398
02:33:00.851 --> 02:33:03.450
<v Speaker 3>But the Camper Lewis and Clark camped </v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at ego like,</v>

3399
02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:04.000
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

3400
02:33:04.001 --> 02:33:06.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not abstract for me.</v>

3401
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Even though we had stoves and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still kind of living and feeling </v>

3402
02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:19.820
<v Speaker 1>what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were feeling to hold the bolt in </v>

3403
02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:19.820
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark Brian Callahan just texted me,</v>

3404
02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:23.840
<v Speaker 1>heard us talking about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get a chance to listen to </v>

3405
02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:24.600
<v Speaker 1>podcasts yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was great.</v>

3406
02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:26.320
<v Speaker 3>That's good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3407
02:33:26.321 --> 02:33:27.480
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3408
02:33:27.481 --> 02:33:30.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was getting the boat.</v>

3409
02:33:30.270 --> 02:33:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Make some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover some ground on the boat,</v>

3410
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:34.020
<v Speaker 3>get out pitch camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to secure.</v>

3411
02:33:34.021 --> 02:33:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Meet through hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3412
02:33:35.250 --> 02:33:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Get back in the boat pitch camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3413
02:33:38.250 --> 02:33:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All in all we went,</v>

3414
02:33:39.331 --> 02:33:41.750
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty something miles down the river was</v>

3415
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:44.000
<v Speaker 1>38 or no more than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3416
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:45.380
<v Speaker 1>he went a long way because I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3417
02:33:45.381 --> 02:33:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that that trip back me and tell it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so cold and damp.</v>

3418
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Dirty was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3419
02:33:51.181 --> 02:33:52.590
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm really cool.</v>

3420
02:33:52.591 --> 02:33:57.591
<v Speaker 1>I'd pull the sleeping bag out of my and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just wrapped up because it was like </v>

3421
02:33:57.591 --> 02:34:00.291
<v Speaker 1>12 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching that I that it was so </v>

3422
02:34:00.291 --> 02:34:04.191
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was 12 degrees and I was such a </v>

3423
02:34:04.191 --> 02:34:04.191
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3424
02:34:04.191 --> 02:34:04.191
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>

3425
02:34:04.191 --> 02:34:08.631
<v Speaker 1>I was with him and he told me American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian stories the whole way and you </v>

3426
02:34:08.631 --> 02:34:09.150
<v Speaker 1>didn't even didn't even bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3427
02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you eight hours of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian stories or whatever the fuck it </v>

3428
02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:17.661
<v Speaker 1>was different than cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the minute something</v>

3429
02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:23.060
<v Speaker 6>wet water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you get like a little bit of </v>

3430
02:34:23.060 --> 02:34:23.530
<v Speaker 6>moisture in your gloves just becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 6>different game.</v>

3431
02:34:23.531 --> 02:34:28.531
<v Speaker 6>I was watching those guys play football </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the playoffs in Denver and it was </v>

3432
02:34:28.531 --> 02:34:32.071
<v Speaker 6>minus three with the windchill factor </v>
<v Speaker 6>and we were playing football in short </v>

3433
02:34:32.071 --> 02:34:35.161
<v Speaker 6>sleeves and Ray Lewis Ray though was </v>
<v Speaker 6>just sitting there and short sleeves </v>

3434
02:34:35.161 --> 02:34:35.610
<v Speaker 6>even on the bench.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just sitting there like this.</v>

3435
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:38.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm just thinking of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I liked it.</v>

3436
02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:41.240
<v Speaker 6>You got no sleeves on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's minus three with the windchill.</v>

3437
02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:43.210
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the actual temperature?</v>

3438
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:45.070
<v Speaker 6>It was nine degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it was cold,</v>

3439
02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:45.990
<v Speaker 6>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cold,</v>

3440
02:34:45.991 --> 02:34:50.991
<v Speaker 6>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cold minus three with the window and </v>

3441
02:34:50.991 --> 02:34:51.670
<v Speaker 6>these guys were hitting each other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hitting each other.</v>

3442
02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:53.360
<v Speaker 6>That ball's got sting your hands at that</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

3443
02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:54.640
<v Speaker 6>I think they have gloves on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was on</v>

3444
02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:00.680
<v Speaker 3>the river is so fucking shallow in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>spots.</v>

3445
02:35:00.681 --> 02:35:05.681
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing that was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprising is that we went bought them </v>

3446
02:35:05.681 --> 02:35:06.530
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a really fragile ecosystem.</v>

3447
02:35:06.531 --> 02:35:08.130
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing that's probably a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

3448
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Of course that rivers heavily damn now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're in that area.</v>

3449
02:35:11.810 --> 02:35:14.510
<v Speaker 3>You got dams above you and you got dance</v>
<v Speaker 3>below you.</v>

3450
02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:19.780
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you spill a run it with </v>

3451
02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:22.160
<v Speaker 3>riverboats like paddle wheel boats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

3452
02:35:22.210 --> 02:35:25.370
<v Speaker 3>it was a confusion of channels so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>took a lot of skill to be able navigate,</v>

3453
02:35:25.371 --> 02:35:30.371
<v Speaker 3>but there was a continuous navigable </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel and when you damn those rivers </v>

3454
02:35:30.561 --> 02:35:34.490
<v Speaker 3>now you get a lot of sedimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the river would,</v>

3455
02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:37.090
<v Speaker 3>at times gets scoured out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a mat,</v>

3456
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:42.150
<v Speaker 3>you get a big flood in the spring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snow is coming out of the mountains </v>

3457
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:45.911
<v Speaker 3>coming out of the yellowstone area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it would come down here and just </v>

3458
02:35:45.911 --> 02:35:46.970
<v Speaker 3>gouges that area and carry all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sediment away.</v>

3459
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:49.880
<v Speaker 3>But the dams do flood control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flood control,</v>

3460
02:35:49.881 --> 02:35:51.980
<v Speaker 3>and they form another function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>erosion control.</v>

3461
02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:56.930
<v Speaker 3>So you get built up over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just mud silt in the river.</v>

3462
02:35:56.931 --> 02:35:58.250
<v Speaker 3>And so the river is a lot different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

3463
02:35:58.310 --> 02:36:02.030
<v Speaker 3>than it used to be in the river as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>as some of the surrounding topography is</v>

3464
02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:05.750
<v Speaker 3>very similar in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some regards untouched.</v>

3465
02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:10.280
<v Speaker 3>That river is now a creation of damming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

3466
02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the river goes to the ocean.</v>

3467
02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:16.610
<v Speaker 3>That river heads when Lewis and Clark </v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about earlier,</v>

3468
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Lewis Clark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Lewis and Clark,</v>

3469
02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:20.120
<v Speaker 3>when they got dispatched on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3470
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:23.780
<v Speaker 3>on their trip and they went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember they left in 18.</v>

3471
02:36:23.781 --> 02:36:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

3472
02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:24.600
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3473
02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:27.770
<v Speaker 3>for her to original for four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went up in one of the things.</v>

3474
02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:30.050
<v Speaker 3>They had many tasks that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do.</v>

3475
02:36:30.051 --> 02:36:35.051
<v Speaker 3>But one of the primary tasks Jefferson </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave him was to find the headwaters of </v>

3476
02:36:35.051 --> 02:36:36.590
<v Speaker 3>the Missouri so people knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3477
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:38.690
<v Speaker 3>the knew the Missouri was a major </v>
<v Speaker 3>artery,</v>

3478
02:36:38.930 --> 02:36:41.810
<v Speaker 3>but where did the Missouri begin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it began,</v>

3479
02:36:41.811 --> 02:36:44.750
<v Speaker 3>was there a viable way to go up and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to the Pacific.</v>

3480
02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:50.800
<v Speaker 3>When they went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found the headwaters of Montana or </v>

3481
02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:54.011
<v Speaker 3>the Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just upstream from where we were in the </v>

3482
02:36:54.011 --> 02:36:54.140
<v Speaker 3>headwaters they discovered were three </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3483
02:36:54.141 --> 02:36:59.141
<v Speaker 3>They named the name of the Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gallatin and the Madison.</v>

3484
02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:02.280
<v Speaker 3>So it was a secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary of Treasury,</v>

3485
02:37:02.281 --> 02:37:03.470
<v Speaker 3>and the President I think is what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

3486
02:37:03.471 --> 02:37:05.810
<v Speaker 3>The name three rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what heads that river.</v>

3487
02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:11.320
<v Speaker 3>So those rivers had won like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone heads up yellowstone lake </v>

3488
02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:11.540
<v Speaker 3>also national park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3489
02:37:11.541 --> 02:37:16.541
<v Speaker 3>the alternate goals another way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Missouri and Jeff had Montana </v>

3490
02:37:16.541 --> 02:37:21.210
<v Speaker 3>and in a goal in flow all the way out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf of Mexico,</v>

3491
02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:25.730
<v Speaker 3>people now argue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were so familiar with the Mississippi</v>

3492
02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:27.270
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mississippi,</v>

3493
02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:32.271
<v Speaker 3>his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that much about the </v>

3494
02:37:32.271 --> 02:37:33.641
<v Speaker 3>Missouri because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have been dinking around </v>

3495
02:37:33.641 --> 02:37:33.641
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi long before the Europeans </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been messing around the Mississippi</v>

3496
02:37:33.641 --> 02:37:37.961
<v Speaker 3>long for the Missouri hydrologists later</v>
<v Speaker 3>and geologists later argued that the </v>

3497
02:37:37.961 --> 02:37:42.731
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't named properly that by any </v>

3498
02:37:42.731 --> 02:37:46.031
<v Speaker 3>estimation it would be that the Missouri</v>
<v Speaker 3>picked up the Mississippi and not vice </v>

3499
02:37:46.031 --> 02:37:50.591
<v Speaker 3>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were those two rivers came </v>

3500
02:37:50.591 --> 02:37:52.691
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Missouri is a true continental </v>

3501
02:37:52.691 --> 02:37:54.911
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's draining all the way from the </v>

3502
02:37:54.911 --> 02:37:56.960
<v Speaker 3>mountains of Montana out to the Gulf of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico and the Mississippi heads like up</v>

3503
02:37:56.961 --> 02:37:58.670
<v Speaker 3>in Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3504
02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:01.460
<v Speaker 3>so they argued that that's actually what</v>
<v Speaker 3>went on.</v>

3505
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:04.790
<v Speaker 3>So the Mississippi by is now the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi by name,</v>

3506
02:38:04.850 --> 02:38:09.850
<v Speaker 3>but in like a physical sense where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking the Mississippi and the </v>

3507
02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:09.850
<v Speaker 3>Missouri,</v>

3508
02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:13.470
<v Speaker 7>I think the riverboat gambling is one of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the craziest ideas ever that they would </v>

3509
02:38:13.470 --> 02:38:17.131
<v Speaker 7>allow you to gamble if you've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 7>something floating and then the state </v>

3510
02:38:17.131 --> 02:38:17.630
<v Speaker 7>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>

3511
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:21.060
<v Speaker 7>Isn't it ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's got to be in between state lines.</v>

3512
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:26.590
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a gray area because they like a no </v>

3513
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:28.900
<v Speaker 7>man's land because it's bordered by,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3514
02:38:29.010 --> 02:38:29.330
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

3515
02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:32.950
<v Speaker 7>Once they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one side was that I think that we should</v>

3516
02:38:32.951 --> 02:38:35.640
<v Speaker 7>have a gray area between all states or </v>
<v Speaker 7>you get.</v>

3517
02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:37.940
<v Speaker 7>You could do anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just.</v>

3518
02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:40.300
<v Speaker 7>You can eat mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can get a hooker,</v>

3519
02:38:40.330 --> 02:38:43.600
<v Speaker 7>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anything shy of murder and robbery.</v>

3520
02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:48.960
<v Speaker 7>Just a wild west grey area where there's</v>
<v Speaker 7>very few laws that everybody knows.</v>

3521
02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:50.950
<v Speaker 7>Everybody knows where it is.</v>

3522
02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Crossed the Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that get to be the lawless </v>

3523
02:38:55.980 --> 02:38:55.980
<v Speaker 3>zone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Great Lakes?</v>

3524
02:38:55.980 --> 02:38:59.791
<v Speaker 3>She can't even see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can be a massive area of utter </v>

3525
02:38:59.791 --> 02:39:03.301
<v Speaker 3>lawlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no like you can't go out </v>

3526
02:39:03.301 --> 02:39:03.301
<v Speaker 3>there and do crazy stuff that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do on the bank.</v>

3527
02:39:03.301 --> 02:39:07.170
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm saying a little gray area still.</v>

3528
02:39:07.250 --> 02:39:10.830
<v Speaker 7>You could have a whole resort out in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>boats on land,</v>

3529
02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:13.630
<v Speaker 7>on land.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anywhere where there's a border,</v>

3530
02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:18.110
<v Speaker 7>it's fucking who knows whatever to </v>
<v Speaker 7>towns.</v>

3531
02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:18.850
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3532
02:39:18.890 --> 02:39:19.370
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3533
02:39:19.490 --> 02:39:24.490
<v Speaker 7>the idea is being bandied about by some </v>
<v Speaker 7>really rich investors that they want to </v>

3534
02:39:24.490 --> 02:39:28.501
<v Speaker 7>build an artificial city that floats and</v>
<v Speaker 7>they want to put it and put it out in </v>

3535
02:39:28.501 --> 02:39:31.140
<v Speaker 7>international waters and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 7>the international space station,</v>

3536
02:39:31.141 --> 02:39:36.141
<v Speaker 7>but something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that they would be able to do this and </v>

3537
02:39:36.141 --> 02:39:36.141
<v Speaker 7>make their own,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the Utopian society.</v>

3538
02:39:36.141 --> 02:39:38.350
<v Speaker 7>They're like tired of this nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's libertarian ideals.</v>

3539
02:39:38.351 --> 02:39:42.850
<v Speaker 7>Everybody wants everybody who joins this</v>
<v Speaker 7>venture to be able to support themselves</v>

3540
02:39:42.851 --> 02:39:47.851
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to decide as a community that we could </v>

3541
02:39:47.851 --> 02:39:47.851
<v Speaker 7>all work this out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to make a drink,</v>

3542
02:39:47.851 --> 02:39:48.140
<v Speaker 7>ganache,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anglin,</v>

3543

<v Speaker 7>and push that pitch out into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But good luck not getting robbed.</v>

3544
02:39:53.130 --> 02:39:58.130
<v Speaker 7>There's a couple of good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3545
02:39:58.500 --> 02:39:59.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3558
02:40:32.521 --> 02:40:34.890
<v Speaker 6>various spots on the sailboat and I was </v>

<v Speaker 6>backup and some pirates come up.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3564
02:40:47.470 --> 02:40:50.370
<v Speaker 6>the odds are pretty small if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many ships are out there,</v>

3565
02:40:50.371 --> 02:40:53.730
<v Speaker 6>but if it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fucked and it could happen.</v>

3572
02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:08.410

<v Speaker 5>of kind of like,</v>

3573
02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:14.070
<v Speaker 5>not overwhelmed but like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like humbled by the landscape some way </v>

3574
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:16.390
<v Speaker 5>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm so new to maritime stuff for me</v>

3575
02:41:16.391 --> 02:41:21.391
<v Speaker 5>to be out on the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I didn't grow up like looking out </v>

3576
02:41:21.391 --> 02:41:21.391
<v Speaker 5>at ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3577
02:41:21.391 --> 02:41:24.460
<v Speaker 5>And for like for me now when I'm on an </v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean and I'm always like,</v>

3578
02:41:24.850 --> 02:41:27.030
<v Speaker 5>this is serious business man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3579
02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:30.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean I get that feeling of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>holy cow.</v>

3580
02:41:30.140 --> 02:41:32.440
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievable when you get out where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't see land.</v>

3581
02:41:32.441 --> 02:41:34.020
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when I started getting that.</v>

3582
02:41:34.030 --> 02:41:37.300
<v Speaker 5>Like a very nice uncomfortable feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My buddy,</v>

3583
02:41:37.301 --> 02:41:40.390
<v Speaker 5>my buddy used to for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he used to take rich guys.</v>

3584
02:41:40.391 --> 02:41:44.740
<v Speaker 5>They buy a sailboat and then you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to sell it to them wherever they were,</v>

3585
02:41:45.460 --> 02:41:49.480
<v Speaker 5>but promise in that when you do a winter</v>
<v Speaker 5>run along the Atlantic,</v>

3586
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:52.570
<v Speaker 5>that storm season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So very few people want to actually take</v>

3587
02:41:52.571 --> 02:41:57.571
<v Speaker 5>the sailboat when you buy in the winter </v>
<v Speaker 5>and bring it to you because they're </v>

3588
02:41:57.571 --> 02:41:57.571
<v Speaker 5>going to get caught in storms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My buddy did that,</v>

3589
02:41:57.571 --> 02:42:02.490
<v Speaker 5>my buddies and he take a 32 foot yacht </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he got caught in a storm out off of </v>

3590
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:05.560
<v Speaker 5>San Francisco in the winter,</v>

3591
02:42:05.930 --> 02:42:08.900
<v Speaker 6>well at night and he had strapped </v>
<v Speaker 6>himself in and he was trying.</v>

3592
02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:13.930
<v Speaker 6>He was trying to turn the boat because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was gotten 20 foot swells that were </v>

3593
02:42:13.930 --> 02:42:18.191
<v Speaker 6>submerging the boat so he would get </v>
<v Speaker 6>submerged under the ocean and then pop </v>

3594
02:42:18.390 --> 02:42:23.390
<v Speaker 6>out for 14 hours and and now I didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 6>it 14 hours alone,</v>

3595
02:42:24.951 --> 02:42:29.951
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had his crew under under ground </v>

3596
02:42:29.951 --> 02:42:30.920
<v Speaker 6>because he was the cab for 14 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did that and they,</v>

3597
02:42:30.921 --> 02:42:33.080
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he radioed for a guy to get him,</v>

3598
02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:35.960
<v Speaker 6>but the guy wasn't experienced enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then they had the radio.</v>

3599
02:42:35.961 --> 02:42:40.961
<v Speaker 6>A guy who had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who did it a lot in Alaska to tow them </v>

3600
02:42:40.961 --> 02:42:42.020
<v Speaker 6>back in and they finally get that guy on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the phone.</v>

3601
02:42:42.021 --> 02:42:44.150
<v Speaker 6>I guess he flies in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gets in his boat now.</v>

3602
02:42:44.270 --> 02:42:47.660
<v Speaker 6>He goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hooks onto them and told them to safety.</v>

3603
02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.550
<v Speaker 6>Fourteen hours at night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

3604
02:42:49.551 --> 02:42:51.150
<v Speaker 6>how'd you know to look?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3605
02:42:51.151 --> 02:42:52.340
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would have to here.</v>

3606
02:42:52.341 --> 02:42:57.341
<v Speaker 6>I'd have to listen for when the swell </v>
<v Speaker 6>was gonna hit me because I couldn't see </v>

3607
02:42:57.341 --> 02:42:57.341
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'd have to listen.</v>

3608
02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:02.700
<v Speaker 6>I hear just and I go and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you and I said,</v>

3609
02:43:04.191 --> 02:43:04.670
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you call it.</v>

3610
02:43:04.671 --> 02:43:06.050
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah.</v>

3611
02:43:06.051 --> 02:43:07.520
<v Speaker 6>He was in a wetsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3612
02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:09.050
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're cold.</v>

3613
02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:10.580
<v Speaker 6>You're really cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3614
02:43:10.581 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 6>You're facing hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Feel like they're going to</v>

3615
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.310
<v Speaker 5>fall off growing up near the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get,</v>

3616
02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:17.260
<v Speaker 5>you get to use to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get,</v>

3617
02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:22.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't really take it into </v>

3618
02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:22.500
<v Speaker 5>consideration of how crazy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I had a friend from Oklahoma,</v>

3619
02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.930
<v Speaker 5>I never saw the ocean before and we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Texas and he went to the ocean and he</v>

3620
02:43:25.931 --> 02:43:30.931
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had just gotten back from the moon </v>

3621
02:43:30.931 --> 02:43:33.190
<v Speaker 5>who might as well plant wears a life </v>
<v Speaker 5>jacket.</v>

3622
02:43:33.191 --> 02:43:33.730
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3623
02:43:33.731 --> 02:43:35.190
<v Speaker 5>they're two different schools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

3624
02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:36.290
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody had done something.</v>

3625
02:43:36.310 --> 02:43:37.570
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3626
02:43:37.571 --> 02:43:38.710
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3627
02:43:38.711 --> 02:43:41.260
<v Speaker 5>I believe that if you get washed </v>
<v Speaker 5>overboard,</v>

3628
02:43:41.261 --> 02:43:42.910
<v Speaker 5>you're probably be injured to begin </v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

3629
02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:47.940
<v Speaker 5>It's much better just to drown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really to sit there and die of </v>

3630
02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:49.030
<v Speaker 5>hypothermia for 16 hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

3631
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:50.470
<v Speaker 5>or sharks come get you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

3632
02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:52.660
<v Speaker 5>they can be right on top of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to find you.</v>

3633
02:43:52.660 --> 02:43:54.070
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend who,</v>

3634
02:43:54.071 --> 02:43:56.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>went to my friend who went to the ocean,</v>

3635
02:43:56.410 --> 02:43:58.840
<v Speaker 5>he had a ticket cigarette before he </v>
<v Speaker 5>described it,</v>

3636
02:43:59.690 --> 02:44:00.770
<v Speaker 5>like you sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

3637
02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:02.920
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lit his cigarette,</v>

3638
02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.640
<v Speaker 5>took a big brother who was worried about</v>
<v Speaker 5>began man descriptive power him because </v>

3639

3707
02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:06.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like one word for be a trophy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that where it'd be like a memento or a </v>

3708
02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:06.680
<v Speaker 3>talisman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3709
02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just like you'll always look at and</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that a lot of cactus quilts for</v>

<v Speaker 3>that whole set of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3711
02:47:13.081 --> 02:47:14.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not some shadow thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3712
02:47:14.821 --> 02:47:17.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm such a man that I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pose his head up.</v>

3713
02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:18.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3714
02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:20.380
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't think of it that way at all.</v>

3715
02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:22.870
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's so much controversy attached.</v>

3716
02:47:22.871 --> 02:47:25.180
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to tell you this too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the hunting experience.</v>

3717
02:47:25.450 --> 02:47:30.450
<v Speaker 7>So the idea of killing your own food.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's so much craziness on both sides.</v>

3718
02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:31.330
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3719
02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:32.500
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the people that are,</v>

3720
02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:34.480
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>anti-hunting or the people that even,</v>

3721
02:47:34.490 --> 02:47:37.660
<v Speaker 7>that eat meat and wear leather and are </v>
<v Speaker 7>still anti hunting.</v>

3722
02:47:37.690 --> 02:47:42.690
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's shocking how many of those people </v>

3723
02:47:42.690 --> 02:47:44.060
<v Speaker 7>that it's such a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can completely understand your,</v>

3724
02:47:44.290 --> 02:47:49.290
<v Speaker 7>your wife's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not wanting to go and do the killing </v>

3725
02:47:49.290 --> 02:47:52.741
<v Speaker 7>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the idea that there's something </v>

3726
02:47:52.741 --> 02:47:55.741
<v Speaker 7>wrong with the people who do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of the things that I saw about this </v>

3727
02:47:55.741 --> 02:47:57.490
<v Speaker 7>new town Connecticut thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the tweets that I read,</v>

3728
02:47:57.491 --> 02:48:02.491
<v Speaker 7>I read a lot of crazy tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but one of them I read with this guy </v>

3729
02:48:02.491 --> 02:48:02.491
<v Speaker 7>said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're a hunter,</v>

3730
02:48:02.491 --> 02:48:02.890
<v Speaker 7>tough shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>get a new hobby,</v>

3731
02:48:02.891 --> 02:48:04.410
<v Speaker 7>no guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it was like tags,</v>

3732
02:48:04.610 --> 02:48:07.180
<v Speaker 7>like Hashtag no guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

3733
02:48:07.181 --> 02:48:08.920
<v Speaker 7>what kind of fucking.</v>

3734
02:48:09.310 --> 02:48:13.960
<v Speaker 7>What kind of crazy nonsense is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>hunter get a new hobby.</v>

3735
02:48:13.961 --> 02:48:18.280
<v Speaker 7>The idea that these people are willing </v>
<v Speaker 7>to get because of crazy people,</v>

3736
02:48:18.281 --> 02:48:21.940
<v Speaker 7>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Many to get all rights to own firearms,</v>

3737
02:48:21.941 --> 02:48:25.150
<v Speaker 7>stripped away to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can't hunt anymore,</v>

3738
02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:30.420
<v Speaker 7>and the idea that someone would just </v>
<v Speaker 7>propose that Tim Ferriss had problem </v>

3739
02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:34.231
<v Speaker 7>with voting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The problem voting is fat guy gets to </v>

3740
02:48:34.231 --> 02:48:36.760
<v Speaker 7>vote to well Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kosta cortical by somebody.</v>

3741
02:48:36.761 --> 02:48:39.520
<v Speaker 7>I can't remember who it was and I read </v>
<v Speaker 7>it and it was about said guns.</v>

3742
02:48:39.521 --> 02:48:43.210
<v Speaker 7>Actually I have a lot to do with why </v>
<v Speaker 7>there isn't a lot of violence.</v>

3743
02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:48.260
<v Speaker 7>They neutralized violence in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's sometimes in the sense that if you </v>

3744
02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:51.901
<v Speaker 7>don't have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you the guy with the biggest knife in </v>

3745
02:48:51.901 --> 02:48:51.901
<v Speaker 7>the strongest guy going to do what he </v>
<v Speaker 7>wants and guns are,</v>

3746
02:48:51.901 --> 02:48:56.671
<v Speaker 7>are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have always been sort of in a society </v>

3747
02:48:56.671 --> 02:48:56.671
<v Speaker 7>they keep.</v>

3748
02:48:56.671 --> 02:49:00.060
<v Speaker 7>They keep the strongest guy with a knife</v>
<v Speaker 7>from raping somebody in front of 12 </v>

3749
02:49:00.060 --> 02:49:03.001
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone's going to shoot that fucking </v>

3750
02:49:03.001 --> 02:49:03.001
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3751
02:49:03.001 --> 02:49:05.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't have society in this form </v>

3752
02:49:05.250 --> 02:49:07.531
<v Speaker 7>without some form of weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to be able to protect people </v>

3753
02:49:07.531 --> 02:49:09.270
<v Speaker 7>against aggressive people from somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 7>else.</v>

3754
02:49:09.330 --> 02:49:14.330
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whether it's a local thread or a thread </v>

3755
02:49:14.330 --> 02:49:15.240
<v Speaker 7>on a boat from another country like </v>
<v Speaker 7>Columbus and his boys.</v>

3756
02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:16.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's just.</v>

3757
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:19.770
<v Speaker 7>If you can't control them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you can't stop them,</v>

3758
02:49:19.771 --> 02:49:24.030
<v Speaker 7>they overcome the same way the Europeans</v>
<v Speaker 7>overcame the American Indians.</v>

3759
02:49:24.110 --> 02:49:29.110
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's really the same exact thing you're </v>

3760
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:30.831
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about people being </v>

3761
02:49:30.831 --> 02:49:32.541
<v Speaker 7>overcome by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's only one way to prevent with </v>

3762
02:49:32.541 --> 02:49:34.851
<v Speaker 7>technology people that are armed the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the only way to prevent that is </v>

3763
02:49:34.851 --> 02:49:38.131
<v Speaker 7>to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The threat of retaliation is too strong </v>

3764
02:49:38.131 --> 02:49:41.080
<v Speaker 7>for one band of evil people to just go </v>
<v Speaker 7>in and take over a town or whatever with</v>

3765
02:49:41.081 --> 02:49:46.081
<v Speaker 7>with guns because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how could you stop it if the whole </v>

3766
02:49:46.081 --> 02:49:48.180
<v Speaker 7>world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole world was disarmed a Wa,</v>

3767
02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:51.560
<v Speaker 7>then you're talking about like some sort</v>
<v Speaker 7>of Africa.</v>

3768
02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.140
<v Speaker 7>Look at the Congo right now with people </v>
<v Speaker 7>like Joseph Kony and his group and stuff</v>

3769
02:49:55.141 --> 02:49:57.180
<v Speaker 7>who come in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've got military grade weapons.</v>

3770
02:49:57.181 --> 02:49:59.160
<v Speaker 7>They come into a village where nobody </v>
<v Speaker 7>has any weapons,</v>

3771
02:49:59.390 --> 02:50:04.390
<v Speaker 7>do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the utopia obviously we'd be no </v>

3772
02:50:04.390 --> 02:50:05.880
<v Speaker 7>one has guns and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you go hunting,</v>

3773
02:50:05.881 --> 02:50:08.810
<v Speaker 7>then he used guns.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess the Utopia.</v>

3774
02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:13.840
<v Speaker 7>What if you did have that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then you'd have guys like chain carbon </v>

3775
02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:15.640
<v Speaker 7>and nate mark or who would be the kings </v>
<v Speaker 7>and call the shots because I'm not going</v>

3776
02:50:15.641 --> 02:50:17.910
<v Speaker 7>to fight those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'd have to band together.</v>

3777
02:50:17.911 --> 02:50:19.500
<v Speaker 7>It's like six guys and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's go.</v>

3778
02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:23.700
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's better to have a.</v>

3779
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:28.750
<v Speaker 7>it's sort of a balancing act and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>better to have some sort of an ability </v>

3780
02:50:28.750 --> 02:50:33.201
<v Speaker 7>to defend yourself physically and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>society can move on and if you can't </v>

3781
02:50:33.201 --> 02:50:37.611
<v Speaker 7>defend yourself physically just because </v>
<v Speaker 7>of your size and you're dealing with </v>

3782
02:50:37.611 --> 02:50:38.130
<v Speaker 7>some Shaquille o'neal type do that.</v>

3783
02:50:38.130 --> 02:50:39.900
<v Speaker 7>You just physically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's nothing you can do about it.</v>

3784
02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:41.310
<v Speaker 7>Then a gun comes into,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3785
02:50:41.311 --> 02:50:46.311
<v Speaker 7>they always say they say conflict </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution in any society becomes </v>

3786
02:50:46.311 --> 02:50:46.450
<v Speaker 7>paramount like in a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in.</v>

3787
02:50:46.451 --> 02:50:48.180
<v Speaker 7>In a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In a society,</v>

3788
02:50:48.181 --> 02:50:53.181
<v Speaker 7>you have to have a mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 7>conflict resolution because inevitably </v>

3789
02:50:53.181 --> 02:50:57.291
<v Speaker 7>there will be conflict among men and so </v>
<v Speaker 7>how you meet out justice and how you </v>

3790
02:50:57.361 --> 02:51:00.570
<v Speaker 7>keep order is very important for any </v>
<v Speaker 7>society.</v>

3791
02:51:00.571 --> 02:51:03.540
<v Speaker 7>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>inevitably there's going to be conflict.</v>

3792
02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:06.270
<v Speaker 7>I think the thing we're missing is </v>
<v Speaker 7>teaching young kids how to fight.</v>

3793
02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:11.360
<v Speaker 7>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a gigantic piece of the </v>

3794
02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:11.360
<v Speaker 7>puzzle that were missing in the way we </v>
<v Speaker 7>raise human beings.</v>

3795
02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:13.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying everybody needs it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying it should be required,</v>

3796
02:51:13.920 --> 02:51:18.920
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm saying that having it readily </v>

3797
02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:20.871
<v Speaker 7>available all the time for kids in </v>
<v Speaker 7>school to teach them a way to get out </v>

3798
02:51:20.871 --> 02:51:23.250
<v Speaker 7>their aggression and not just </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessarily defense,</v>

3799
02:51:23.251 --> 02:51:24.690
<v Speaker 7>but also just dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3800
02:51:24.691 --> 02:51:26.830
<v Speaker 7>let's stop again.</v>

3801
02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:29.070
<v Speaker 7>I think it would stop bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really do.</v>

3802
02:51:29.071 --> 02:51:34.071
<v Speaker 7>I think if you taught kids martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 7>would stop almost all bullying because </v>

3803
02:51:34.071 --> 02:51:35.970
<v Speaker 7>kids would be involved in competition </v>
<v Speaker 7>and when they're involved in competition</v>

3804
02:51:35.971 --> 02:51:40.971
<v Speaker 7>and not thinking about picking on weak </v>
<v Speaker 7>people thinking about how to advance a </v>

3805
02:51:40.971 --> 02:51:44.760
<v Speaker 7>game so they can compete in whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jujitsu or wrestling or boxing or any,</v>

3806
02:51:44.761 --> 02:51:45.330
<v Speaker 7>any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any,</v>

3807
02:51:45.331 --> 02:51:50.331
<v Speaker 7>any of those martial sports.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think if you teach as many people as </v>

3808
02:51:50.581 --> 02:51:51.810
<v Speaker 7>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how to do it,</v>

3809
02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:54.600
<v Speaker 7>you're gonna have a much more polite </v>
<v Speaker 7>society,</v>

3810
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:56.520
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that outlet is very strong.</v>

3811
02:51:56.521 --> 02:52:01.521
<v Speaker 7>That's where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why they say video games are so </v>

3812
02:52:01.521 --> 02:52:01.521
<v Speaker 7>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's an.</v>

3813
02:52:01.521 --> 02:52:02.610
<v Speaker 7>It's an outlet for our problem in this </v>
<v Speaker 7>country.</v>

3814
02:52:02.611 --> 02:52:03.620
<v Speaker 7>Countries,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not a gun problem.</v>

3815
02:52:03.940 --> 02:52:08.940
<v Speaker 7>Opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody keeps saying it's a gun </v>

3816
02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:08.940
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>

3817
02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:08.940
<v Speaker 5>Guns are a part of a mental health </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

3818
02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:11.410
<v Speaker 5>It's a mental health problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's these old people,</v>

3819
02:52:11.411 --> 02:52:14.200
<v Speaker 5>but people look at that as being </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that they can achieve easily,</v>

3820
02:52:14.201 --> 02:52:19.201
<v Speaker 5>but the thing that I've been thinking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot about lately on the issue is that </v>

3821
02:52:19.201 --> 02:52:21.580
<v Speaker 5>it's the way that people look at like </v>
<v Speaker 5>constitutional freedoms.</v>

3822
02:52:21.610 --> 02:52:26.200
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a reluctance on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right this traditionally this reluctance</v>

3823
02:52:26.201 --> 02:52:31.201
<v Speaker 5>to sort of disregard first amendment </v>
<v Speaker 5>liberties sometimes and and on the left </v>

3824
02:52:31.201 --> 02:52:35.500
<v Speaker 5>there's this tendency to want to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>disregard second amendment liberties in </v>

3825
02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:37.420
<v Speaker 5>the same way that someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy that said,</v>

3826
02:52:37.421 --> 02:52:38.020
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

3827
02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:39.730
<v Speaker 5>if you hunt tough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3828
02:52:39.770 --> 02:52:41.380
<v Speaker 5>figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could look and say,</v>

3829
02:52:41.381 --> 02:52:46.381
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Internet is used for all these </v>

3830
02:52:46.381 --> 02:52:48.841
<v Speaker 5>things and in like nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 5>plotters communicated over the Internet </v>

3831
02:52:48.841 --> 02:52:51.730
<v Speaker 5>and various things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you use the Internet for </v>

3832
02:52:51.730 --> 02:52:51.730
<v Speaker 5>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 5>screw you,</v>

3833
02:52:51.730 --> 02:52:51.940
<v Speaker 5>we're getting rid of it.</v>

3834
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:55.930
<v Speaker 5>It was like no one would ever make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>case like we can be used for evil,</v>

3835
02:52:55.931 --> 02:52:57.170
<v Speaker 5>therefore it should go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3836
02:52:57.230 --> 02:53:02.230
<v Speaker 5>it's just not a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to be in a situation where I'm </v>

3837
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:05.341
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me it's like first amendment stuff </v>

3838
02:53:05.341 --> 02:53:09.030
<v Speaker 5>extremely important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Second Amendment issues are extremely </v>

3839
02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:09.030
<v Speaker 5>important to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

3840
02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:12.220
<v Speaker 5>I feel that just to do reactionary </v>
<v Speaker 5>measures against our amendment rights in</v>

3841
02:53:12.221 --> 02:53:14.990
<v Speaker 5>thinking we're going to solve some </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem isn't right the same way.</v>

3842
02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:20.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's the right to suppress</v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom of speech in order to in order </v>

3843
02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.921
<v Speaker 5>to like solve a problem that might have </v>
<v Speaker 5>come out of the right of assembly or </v>

3844
02:53:22.921 --> 02:53:26.341
<v Speaker 5>that might've come out of freedom of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>press that someone incited violence to </v>

3845
02:53:26.341 --> 02:53:28.961
<v Speaker 5>the press so they should be shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nor do I think that firearms owners </v>

3846
02:53:28.961 --> 02:53:28.961
<v Speaker 5>should be shut down.</v>

3847
02:53:28.961 --> 02:53:33.180
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a very complicated issue </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it also fosters some cookie </v>

3848
02:53:33.180 --> 02:53:36.571
<v Speaker 5>cutter type thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes the people on the left just </v>

3849
02:53:36.571 --> 02:53:39.931
<v Speaker 5>follow that predetermined pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior and people in the right follow </v>

3850
02:53:39.931 --> 02:53:40.750
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one is excited.</v>

3851
02:53:41.170 --> 02:53:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's taking a side on it and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>suppose we're pushing it as a problem to</v>

3852
02:53:44.111 --> 02:53:45.200
<v Speaker 5>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3853
02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:47.800
<v Speaker 5>there's obviously something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the problem?</v>

3854
02:53:47.801 --> 02:53:49.180
<v Speaker 5>It's the problem is that everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 5>guns.</v>

3855
02:53:49.181 --> 02:53:52.210
<v Speaker 5>That way you can't stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone would shoot the guy if he tried</v>

3856
02:53:52.211 --> 02:53:54.040
<v Speaker 5>to run into a school and shoot people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

3857
02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:59.100
<v Speaker 5>is that the solution or is this solution</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have to pull all the guns out </v>

3858
02:53:59.100 --> 02:53:59.860
<v Speaker 5>of people's homes and then the only the </v>
<v Speaker 5>military has the guns.</v>

3859
02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are going to be comfortable with </v>

3860
02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:05.280
<v Speaker 5>that either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

3861
02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:07.601
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the correct solution and how </v>

3862
02:54:07.601 --> 02:54:07.601
<v Speaker 5>much is mental health taken into it?</v>

3863
02:54:07.601 --> 02:54:11.490
<v Speaker 5>How much are SSR,</v>
<v Speaker 5>i's and whatever these fucking </v>

3864
02:54:11.490 --> 02:54:11.490
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants are doing to disturbed </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

3865
02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:16.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people out there that </v>

3866
02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:16.760
<v Speaker 5>need antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes their life better.</v>

3867
02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:16.760
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard that.</v>

3868
02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:18.820
<v Speaker 5>I believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also know Phil Hartman,</v>

3869
02:54:18.850 --> 02:54:23.850
<v Speaker 5>I knew Phil Hartman very well and his </v>
<v Speaker 5>wife was on antidepressants when she </v>

3870
02:54:23.850 --> 02:54:23.860
<v Speaker 5>shot and killed him and then kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>herself.</v>

3871
02:54:24.310 --> 02:54:26.260
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that it is.</v>

3872
02:54:26.290 --> 02:54:31.290
<v Speaker 5>They want a settlement with Zoloft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that stuff creates psychotic </v>

3873
02:54:31.290 --> 02:54:31.300
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it does.</v>

3874
02:54:31.570 --> 02:54:32.350
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty,</v>

3875
02:54:32.590 --> 02:54:34.980
<v Speaker 5>pretty much proven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3876
02:54:34.981 --> 02:54:39.981
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you start having to pay off giant </v>

3877
02:54:39.981 --> 02:54:42.781
<v Speaker 5>sums,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty proven that there's </v>

3878
02:54:42.781 --> 02:54:44.761
<v Speaker 5>something fucked up going on with </v>
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants and the human mind and </v>

3879
02:54:44.761 --> 02:54:47.110
<v Speaker 5>it's not always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not everybody.</v>

3880
02:54:47.111 --> 02:54:52.111
<v Speaker 5>I think there's people that their brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>is just not set up correctly.</v>

3881
02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:58.680
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a whole bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>in this world where they got a shitty </v>

3882
02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:02.500
<v Speaker 5>roll the dice and their brain is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>not working good and I think if you want</v>

3883
02:55:02.501 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 5>to medicate people and</v>

3884
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:06.500
<v Speaker 7>just start throwing chemicals at the </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem,</v>

3885
02:55:06.770 --> 02:55:11.770
<v Speaker 7>you might not always be doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing and when you do that and you have </v>

3886
02:55:11.770 --> 02:55:15.521
<v Speaker 7>a really disturbed individual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like it's in the case of over and over </v>

3887
02:55:15.521 --> 02:55:15.521
<v Speaker 7>again with some of these shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

3888
02:55:15.521 --> 02:55:20.220
<v Speaker 7>the hypothesis is that these drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 7>allowing these kids to much more easily </v>

3889
02:55:20.871 --> 02:55:24.700
<v Speaker 7>performed horrific tasks because they've</v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of changed reality.</v>

3890
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:26.750
<v Speaker 7>That body's chemistry or.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3891
02:55:26.751 --> 02:55:29.330
<v Speaker 7>well the blade,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way they interact with the mind that</v>

3892
02:55:29.331 --> 02:55:34.331
<v Speaker 7>they allow you to accept things in a way</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you would normally have like giant </v>

3893
02:55:34.331 --> 02:55:35.630
<v Speaker 7>red psychological flags going off left </v>
<v Speaker 7>and right.</v>

3894
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:38.270
<v Speaker 7>And instead it just allows you to like </v>
<v Speaker 7>deal with shit.</v>

3895
02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:42.290
<v Speaker 7>And that's one of the ways that for some</v>
<v Speaker 7>folks it helps them overcome depression.</v>

3896
02:55:42.620 --> 02:55:47.620
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like these things are very unusual </v>

3897
02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:48.020
<v Speaker 7>because one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>learned talking to my friends that,</v>

3898
02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:50.870
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Romney's antidepressants,</v>

3899
02:55:51.050 --> 02:55:56.050
<v Speaker 7>including people that absolutely need </v>
<v Speaker 7>them and then people who've tried them </v>

3900
02:55:56.050 --> 02:55:58.940
<v Speaker 7>and gave them away is that they never </v>
<v Speaker 7>know exactly which one's going to work </v>

3901
02:55:58.940 --> 02:55:59.770
<v Speaker 7>for you and they'll switch medications </v>
<v Speaker 7>on your like,</v>

3902
02:55:59.790 --> 02:56:00.680
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's try this.</v>

3903
02:56:00.770 --> 02:56:03.380
<v Speaker 7>How's that one?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then a lot of it is just everybody's</v>

3904
02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:08.440
<v Speaker 7>got a different setup and what works for</v>
<v Speaker 7>you might not work for him and the only </v>

3905
02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:09.290
<v Speaker 7>way to tell is they gotta fucking try </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit out on you.</v>

3906
02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:14.860
<v Speaker 7>I have a real hard problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you're dealing with psychotic </v>

3907
02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:14.860
<v Speaker 7>people that might have access to assault</v>
<v Speaker 7>rifles.</v>

3908
02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:19.780
<v Speaker 7>Like when you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those things together and then you find </v>

3909
02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:22.421
<v Speaker 7>out that 90 percent of all these school </v>
<v Speaker 7>shootings are either someone is on </v>

3910
02:56:22.421 --> 02:56:24.200
<v Speaker 7>withdrawal from Ssri or someone who's on</v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

3911
02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:28.250
<v Speaker 7>Ninety percent of that they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 7>that these mental health experts on.</v>

3912
02:56:28.251 --> 02:56:30.120
<v Speaker 7>They were talking about like jared </v>
<v Speaker 7>lauffner,</v>

3913
02:56:30.121 --> 02:56:34.880
<v Speaker 7>the guy who shot the Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had been symptomatic for 10 years.</v>

3914
02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:38.750
<v Speaker 7>He was psychotic and symptomatic and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>was very clear that,</v>

3915
02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:40.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the problem was he said that there's</v>

3916
02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:45.820
<v Speaker 7>in the law,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't incarcerate somebody against </v>

3917
02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:45.820
<v Speaker 7>their will unless they are.</v>

3918
02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:46.100
<v Speaker 7>Would love to hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're going to wrap this up.</v>

3919
02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:47.520
<v Speaker 7>It's 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 7>hurts.</v>

3920
02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:51.400

<v Speaker 7>three hours in the show.</v>

<v Speaker 7>We go.</v>

3922
02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:54.680

3923
02:56:54.681 --> 02:56:56.480
<v Speaker 7>the audio,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it gets too long,</v>

3924
02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:01.840
<v Speaker 7>gets fucked somehow in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the only way we could do is three </v>

3925
02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:01.840
<v Speaker 7>hours.</v>
