WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>The call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that okay?</v>

2
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that comfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>That's where there's a constant debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to whether or not the headphones on</v>

6
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:15.561
<v Speaker 1>the way to go because the headphones or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you can hear exactly</v>

7
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>what other people are going to hear when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they listen to the podcast so you can</v>

8
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:23.541
<v Speaker 1>kind of review it while it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if only I wear headphones than it</v>

9
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>feels weird like I'm interviewing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems kind of to focus my</v>

11
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>attention just on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

14
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Good to see Dublin from maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for whatever reason,</v>

15
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always stumble with Multidisciplinary</v>

16
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.173
<v Speaker 1>Association for Psychedelic Studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

17
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually I was just yesterday with</v>

18
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>and today with Ralph Metzner and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name from him in a way.</v>

19
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of consciousness and I needed a</v>

20
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>name for the organization that had a p</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it for a psychedelic and so I was</v>

21
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>looking around for words that had a p in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and maps and I really liked what</v>

22
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Ralph did and with Tim and robbed us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest and say,</v>

23
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought maps.</v>

24
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>It helps</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain a territory.</v>

25
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you guys are so important when it</v>

26
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:19.491
<v Speaker 1>comes to the dialogue of psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 1>because from an outsider,</v>

27
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>this is how I always viewed maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maps is always like,</v>

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the actual really smart dudes</v>

29
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>during the psychedelics because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who wacky fuckers out there in</v>

30
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the world of psychedelics and they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring you crystals and talk to you</v>

31
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>about channeling and I know a healer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much going on.</v>

32
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was science and then</v>

33
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>there was people doing actual peer</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewed studies.</v>

34
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>There's actual scientists involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was real data and you guys were</v>

35
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>pursuing it the right way and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

36
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are so important because</v>

37
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of people that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weird things about</v>

38
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell people that you went out</v>

39
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and drank whiskey until your feet went</v>
<v Speaker 1>numb and you shit your pants and no one</v>

40
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>cares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you tell people that you got</v>

41
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>together with some friends and you took</v>
<v Speaker 1>a naturally occurring psychedelic drug</v>

42
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>and you explored your consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so much happier now and you feel</v>

43
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>better about life and you're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic if you do that,</v>

44
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>you're some fucking wacky hippy Druggie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some loser.</v>

45
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the perception and so we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got this coming out and we've looked at</v>

46
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>other social change movements like gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage and gay rights and it comes</v>

47
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>from people coming out because there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>loads of smart people that do</v>

48
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.901
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics or talented or emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise and they just keep it quiet so</v>

49
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>people don't really know who in society</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had these influences and they don't</v>

50
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>have to keep it quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>

51
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>It's jobs think that their employees for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason would be better off if they</v>

52
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>didn't do certain drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain jobs.</v>

53
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that they get to control your</v>

54
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>body when you're not there is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

55
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the companies like</v>

56
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>facebook and Google</v>

57
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 3>and all these tech companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't do drug tests.</v>

58
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 3>They're better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

59
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 3>they don't lose everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:11.611
<v Speaker 3>They know the pot test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good Lord.</v>

61
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would lose.</v>

62
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 3>The entire company would come back with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real straight laced republican trump</v>

63
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 3>supporting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

65
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 3>the innovation and psychedelics and</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and looking at things in</v>

66
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are getting to appreciate that.</v>

67
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 3>I think more the culture is changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we're in these camps.</v>

68
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have these camps,</v>

69
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 3>the do's and the don'ts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you take drugs,</v>

70
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 3>do not take drugs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of people that pride</v>

71
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 3>themselves on one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're a perturber or non</v>

72
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 3>perturbed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there's,</v>

73
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 3>there's people that get weird about</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are doing things other than</v>

74
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like it.</v>

75
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we need this kind of</v>

76
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:52.640
<v Speaker 3>coming out.</v>

77
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were having these global</v>

78
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic dinners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is our 30th anniversary</v>

79
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow is the 30th year that I started</v>

80
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:07.021
<v Speaker 3>maps in 1986 and we're asking people to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

81
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 3>in their own homes or with their friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>to invite people over and then have them</v>

82
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 3>tell stories of what psychedelics have</v>
<v Speaker 3>meant to them or what their hopes are</v>

83
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 3>for psychedelic research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're inviting everyone to do it,</v>

84
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 3>like on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to make a night of it.</v>

85
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like a Holiday Inn.</v>

86
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.093
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 3>During April,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the month of April.</v>

88
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Generally you're creating your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>holiday.</v>

89
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.291
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

90
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 3>there's people that have done this</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

91
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with conversations about death with</v>

92
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:38.281
<v Speaker 3>dinner and drugs with dinner event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they try to promote conversations in</v>

93
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 3>safe places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where people feel comfortable to</v>

94
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 3>really be more honest and they can open</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

95
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 3>And so it's kind of modeling on that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it hopefully helps people to come</v>

96
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 3>out even more.</v>

97
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we even have like a twitter,</v>

98
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

99
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 3>it's a Hashtag psychedelics because so</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can write in and just say</v>

100
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics matter to me because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

101
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

102
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 3>I am more hopeful or I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

103
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 3>feeling that multigenerational trauma</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be addressed through.</v>

104
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that incredible that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is one of the best things for it.</v>

105
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:20.581
<v Speaker 3>Is Mtma one of the best things as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting over traumatic experiences is an</v>

106
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 3>illegal drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>And yet there's a carved out area that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been able to make legal which is</v>

108
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>the research area and it's because</v>
<v Speaker 3>science is the vehicle in our culture</v>

109
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 3>that we trust more religion than our</v>
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>

110
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 3>And so it felt like science and healing</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the ways into the culture that was</v>

111
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.870
<v Speaker 3>freaked out by psychedelics in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties and now because of these crises</v>

112
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 3>we're in and also these tools that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be shown to be really helpful and that</v>

113
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 3>people have made life's out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not hurt them.</v>

114
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 3>It's helped them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people don't it.</v>

115
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's where we think the research is</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping people create a space where they</v>

116
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.274
<v Speaker 3>can talk about it.</v>

117
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's people are starting to</v>

118
00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:11.490
<v Speaker 4>understand the true nature of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things instead of the propaganda.</v>

119
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Then they're doing it from people like</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself being really honest about their</v>

120
00:06:15.871 --> 00:06:19.260
<v Speaker 4>experiences and people like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even more importantly,</v>

121
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.580
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of people like you</v>

122
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.680
<v Speaker 4>that have actually gone out and pursued</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the significant scientific data</v>

123
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.490
<v Speaker 4>on psychedelics and the beneficial</v>
<v Speaker 4>properties to it so that we can</v>

124
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:32.370
<v Speaker 4>understand like we have this idea about</v>
<v Speaker 4>a thing.</v>

125
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put all your ideologies.</v>

126
00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Decide whether you're a right wing or</v>
<v Speaker 4>left wing.</v>

127
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.670
<v Speaker 4>We have an idea about a thing that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct and this idea about a thing is</v>

128
00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:46.671
<v Speaker 4>that there's a certain group of</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness adjusting substances that</v>

129
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:50.700
<v Speaker 4>are for losers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're for dumb people there for fools</v>

130
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.900
<v Speaker 4>and don't you mess with those and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody who does those is lazy and</v>

131
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 4>Stinky and wet and you'll lock there</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people.</v>

132
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.340
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>automatically lock into that pattern of</v>

133
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:05.640
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's their go to for for any drugs.</v>

134
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Anything that's not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet those same people oftentimes</v>

135
00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.060
<v Speaker 4>will drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have no problem doing that,</v>

136
00:07:12.061 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 4>and they allowed times they'll take</v>
<v Speaker 4>pills to which,</v>

137
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 4>which is even more bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 3>There was this idea that drugs are</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana hurts.</v>

139
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:25.571
<v Speaker 3>Your Iq says there has been to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

140
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arrows,</v>

141
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 3>a study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the national institutes of health just</v>

142
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 3>two weeks ago had a conference in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington at the NIH headquarters.</v>

143
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 3>The head of Nih was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head of night at the head of Nih,</v>

144
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 3>national institute mental health about</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and cannabinoids,</v>

145
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 3>and it was a neuroscience review and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they presented results that suggested</v>

146
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:50.951
<v Speaker 3>that there was a heavy marijuana smokers</v>
<v Speaker 3>that started early in their lives over,</v>

147
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was done in New Zealand over like a</v>

148
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 3>20 year period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had some differences.</v>

149
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Lower Iq than there</v>

150
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.100
<v Speaker 4>control groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

151
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:05.580
<v Speaker 4>if you're talking about people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking marijuana heavily,</v>

152
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.150
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I would say is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you're smoking marijuana</v>

153
00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.070
<v Speaker 4>heavily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to do a whole lot of</v>

154
00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:13.890
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to zone the fuck out.</v>

155
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 4>You're going to do a lot of zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And out and while sober people might be</v>

156
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.260
<v Speaker 4>absorbing more information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're probably often worldly Iran all</v>

157
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.090
<v Speaker 4>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not necessarily healthy.</v>

158
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 4>I think all psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>C should be an enhancer,</v>

159
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.300
<v Speaker 4>but they shouldn't be in replace of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

160
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.010
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

161
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to be high from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment I wake up to the moment I go to</v>

162
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.500
<v Speaker 4>sleep every single day and this is how I</v>
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>

163
00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm just high all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

164
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

165
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take a break,</v>

166
00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:42.180
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

167
00:08:42.181 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I had that</v>

168
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 3>sense of as in my early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so smoking all the time to be high,</v>

169
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

170
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.600
<v Speaker 3>And I enjoyed it and I felt that got me</v>
<v Speaker 3>into things that got me really into</v>

171
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:54.610
<v Speaker 3>physical work and labor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

172
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fun and exercise.</v>

173
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the opposite of the couch</v>

174
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>potato idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But pod and exercise.</v>

176
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm just men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran the New York marathon.</v>

177
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Willow stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

178
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tired in the middle.</v>

179
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:15.351
<v Speaker 1>And I walked into a Porta potty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke some.</v>

180
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 1>We jump back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

181
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delirious lot of Jujitsu people smoked</v>

182
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>pot for Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one.</v>

183
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Snowboarders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snowboarders.</v>

184
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Snowboarders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say basketball players.</v>

186
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that.</v>

187
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things about the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you better not be testing for</v>

188
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>weed because these dudes it when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make sense too,</v>

189
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>because I don't play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I play pool and it's,</v>

190
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

191
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>one similarity that they share is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about touch and feel and touch and</v>

192
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>feel is way enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the best pool player is also</v>

193
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:55.554
<v Speaker 1>smoked pot.</v>

194
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

195
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:02.151
<v Speaker 1>a full blown up his spot to spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a video of me doing an</v>

196
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 1>impression of him and he's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>

197
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say it seems earl strickland,</v>

198
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 1>he's a genius pool player and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have occasionally enjoyed</v>

199
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying.</v>

200
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>

201
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>like they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

202
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're smoking pot and playing,</v>

203
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>you can see things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a better sense of where the</v>

204
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>ball's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have more sensitivity as far as how</v>

205
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 1>far it rolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:32.811
<v Speaker 1>I used to play racquetball a lot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>handball and a lot and sometimes I would</v>

207
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 1>play stoned and sometimes I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>

208
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 1>she did have that deeper sense of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the moment.</v>

209
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>You were just one step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instant more into the moment as and</v>

210
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>predicting and knowing and just um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could never,</v>

211
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>there was an unpredictability about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could never really tell if I would</v>

212
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 1>play better or worse.</v>

213
00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why you play good</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're never sure and you just</v>

214
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>stayed on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an ego dissolve in quality of</v>

216
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 1>any of these psychoactive substances and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that ego dissolve in quality</v>

217
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 1>gives you more space to move around with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your other focuses.</v>

218
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>That's my theory about it because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>always felt like,</v>

219
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.270
<v Speaker 1>like with Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely feel better at Jujitsu</v>

220
00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:24.240
<v Speaker 1>when you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to figure out why.</v>

221
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also feel like you somehow or</v>

222
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 1>another you feel more more vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet you do better.</v>

223
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you're more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of freaked out by any</v>

224
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>aggression or more trying to avoid any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of conflict.</v>

225
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what the driving studies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and drivers show that people</v>

226
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 1>know that they're slightly impaired and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take defensive measures and they</v>

227
00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>drive slower and more aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of error as well.</v>

228
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>And you're correcting for it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive more carefully.</v>

230
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the part that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to really be the experts on the</v>

231
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.310
<v Speaker 1>risks as well as the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

232
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we can't ignore that.</v>

233
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>There are both sides of it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With edibles,</v>

234
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>edibles and driving settled down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>police settle down.</v>

235
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sure that's a good idea.</v>

236
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I think the idea we need to do</v>

237
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 1>is more move to performance tests rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than drug tests and then that's really</v>

238
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 1>directly what you're concerned about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you need people's behaviors to</v>

239
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you checked their real performance,</v>

240
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 1>not these indicators or predictors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

241
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 1>From my personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference between how you</v>

242
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:51.061
<v Speaker 1>understand and operate under it as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's been smoking pot for like</v>

243
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.120
<v Speaker 1>15 years versus someone who's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pot for like a week or a month</v>

244
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>or even a year.</v>

245
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference in sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to handle being really high</v>

246
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your anxiety takes hold of you because</v>

247
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

248
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.270
<v Speaker 1>and you start freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can't drive,</v>

249
00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 1>you can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people who that are</v>

250
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Geez,</v>

251
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>like that action Bronson Character</v>
<v Speaker 1>Action Bronson came in here.</v>

252
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:21.510
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker smoked like nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>joints in the entire time he was here.</v>

253
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>He just kept smoking and I had to tap</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

254
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I sit back and watch and he just never</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowed down.</v>

255
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:29.640
<v Speaker 1>He kept going in and kept lighting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker up.</v>

256
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's insane.</v>

257
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 1>But like a dude like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy can handle being high.</v>

258
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.800
<v Speaker 1>He understands how to be high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for someone who's not really that</v>

259
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 1>experienced that it man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a car,</v>

260
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

261
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:44.440
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be.</v>

262
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can just focus on performance and</v>

263
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a while to get used to it.</v>

264
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I think what my point was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the performance varies considerably</v>

265
00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think you could even do like</v>

266
00:13:56.111 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>an across the board performance tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say,</v>

267
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've shown that this guy under five</v>

268
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>joints can do BMX flips because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those bmx dudes,</v>

269
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>they could do that shit drunk too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

270
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to be an individual</v>

271
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 1>examination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>The the part that I really liked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising and playing racquetball with</v>

273
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:20.131
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is that sometimes it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>so easy to forget the score and then you</v>

274
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>realize you're not really playing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the score.</v>

275
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>so into the moment and playing.</v>

276
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Just Joanne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

277
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>just enjoying their movements and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this competition,</v>

278
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:35.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's about helping each other do</v>
<v Speaker 1>your best and then the score.</v>

279
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one downside of,</v>

280
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your height.</v>

281
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll try and keep track of the score.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You needed someone there who's sober to</v>

282
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.500
<v Speaker 1>hire someone to do with a clicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't be bothered.</v>

283
00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you just give each of the</v>

284
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>participation trophies like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with kids today where everybody</v>

285
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>gets a trophy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about the score.</v>

286
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Just play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep playing.</v>

287
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

288
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I think this idea though of science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the being rigorous about things.</v>

289
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

290
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean I saw something that you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the aliens and I thought you did.</v>

291
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a TV documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you did great about it.</v>

292
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Thank very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

293
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alien.</v>

294
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.361
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

295
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to believe more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to be more than me.</v>

296
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking want to believe,</v>

297
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm honest and I look at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence,</v>

298
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not their folks.</v>

299
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing there.</v>

300
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 1>There's like a few people have seen some</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

301
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>affidavits.</v>

302
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got nothing.</v>

303
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>You got some shaky ass pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be anything.</v>

304
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Could be a bird that got shot out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannon.</v>

305
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 1>We some of these photos that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced or from another planet like,</v>

306
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.320
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

307
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows what that is.</v>

308
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the bigger question is if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

309
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

310
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I've tried to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for me,</v>

311
00:15:57.051 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 1>if it's true that there's aliens from</v>
<v Speaker 1>here somewhere else that are here,</v>

312
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 1>what would I do differently in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I really need to solve that mystery?</v>

313
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Which doesn't seem very compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem likely,</v>

314
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a way to be connected to</v>

315
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 1>something broader.</v>

316
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like a spiritual urging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a.</v>

317
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like a secular Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

318
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.870
<v Speaker 1>that's a really think it is and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm the only one.</v>

319
00:16:21.871 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I don't even think this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>my theory.</v>

320
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I think other people definitely thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>this up that there's some sort of a</v>

321
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:32.540
<v Speaker 1>connection between people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to believe in religion and don't</v>

322
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>want to believe in any sort of ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies,</v>

323
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but they desperately want some superior</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they reach out to the skies and</v>

324
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:47.471
<v Speaker 1>some of them get fixated on the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even they have been personally</v>

325
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:50.270
<v Speaker 1>visited because it makes them more</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>

326
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.080
<v Speaker 1>It gives her life a bit more meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you were chosen,</v>

327
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>were testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were trying you out conveniently,</v>

328
00:16:56.751 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 1>always while you're dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trust me,</v>

329
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really happening.</v>

330
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not just sleeping and dreaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy.</v>

331
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are actually on a spaceship and so</v>

332
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you get these people that are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>delusional and when you look at the</v>

333
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:11.900
<v Speaker 1>sheer raw numbers of people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and then you look at the Ufo</v>

334
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 1>story stories and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of these people could be</v>

335
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>delusional?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could it be all of them?</v>

336
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Could it be some of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could it be most of them?</v>

337
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.060
<v Speaker 1>What's the real number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the the cold hard thing</v>

338
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>that we got to on that Scifi show</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't discount the</v>

339
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 1>possibility of definitely not of</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraterrestrial life and definitely not</v>

340
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 1>of people being visited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that</v>

341
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>extraterrestrial life has visited or</v>
<v Speaker 1>observed us and there was a unique</v>

342
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>unique moment where someone was there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and witnessed it and maybe even those in</v>

343
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 1>contact with them and then they took off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were gone and they never</v>

344
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 1>returned again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is entirely possible because that's</v>

345
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>entirely</v>

346
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.400
<v Speaker 4>what we would do if we could just go</v>
<v Speaker 4>from planet to planet as dumb as we are</v>

347
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we could just go from planet to</v>

348
00:17:57.571 --> 00:17:59.810
<v Speaker 4>planet and do studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah,</v>

349
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 4>we would do it and if we found an</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent life form that was like more</v>

350
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 4>primitive than us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cave people,</v>

351
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.120
<v Speaker 4>like some 2001 with the monolith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

352
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 4>if we found something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think we'd go say hi.</v>

353
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Of course we would say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would definitely say hi,</v>

354
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 4>and then we jet back off at our fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep machine off into the skies.</v>

355
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 4>We would do exactly what we think they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would do.</v>

356
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

357
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 3>you could make the case that we already</v>
<v Speaker 3>know by looking at these tribes in the</v>

358
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:29.211
<v Speaker 3>Amazon that are as if living cave men</v>
<v Speaker 3>without much contact and we try more and</v>

359
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:33.400
<v Speaker 3>more now just to let them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you go there,</v>

360
00:18:33.401 --> 00:18:38.401
<v Speaker 3>they're wearing Nike's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Koby Bryant tee shirts on Dev.</v>

361
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Like mickey mouse hats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

362
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see these people in the jungle and</v>

363
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 3>they have all this western clothing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

364
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird,</v>

365
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 3>but yet they're living like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>indigenous tribe.</v>

366
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very few that are still pretty</v>

367
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:57.951
<v Speaker 3>uncontacted primitive and I actually did</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pod ceremony one time with some native</v>

368
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 3>American church Shaman to how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can say that and,</v>

369
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.283
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

370
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this was,</v>

371
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they wanted to see what a friend of</v>

372
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:13.270
<v Speaker 3>mine who was helping them with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep was,</v>

373
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using [inaudible].</v>

374
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.770
<v Speaker 3>It seemed to help him get stronger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was Mtma and so some novel,</v>

375
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they would go off and do a pod</v>

376
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 3>ceremonies somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would tend to their animals,</v>

377
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 3>sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy.</v>

378
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.091
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

379
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:30.480
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

380
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

381
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it,</v>

382
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 3>did you understand what he was saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

383
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I skipped those.</v>

384
00:19:35.691 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we might've gone too deep for</v>

385
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:43.611
<v Speaker 3>this episode that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine was living out with the</v>

386
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Navajos to kind of get his head</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>

387
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he would help take care of their</v>

388
00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 3>animals when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this male female shamans both would go</v>

389
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:56.530
<v Speaker 3>off to do pod ceremonies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

390
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 3>He stayed out there for about a year and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kind of put himself together and they</v>

391
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:03.630
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what helped you and we're interested in</v>

392
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:06.270
<v Speaker 3>what your medicine is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said it was Mtma.</v>

393
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we'd be interested in trying to</v>

394
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.050
<v Speaker 3>experience Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was invited out there and we ended</v>

395
00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:21.231
<v Speaker 3>up doing this ceremony in a Navajo and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only spoke Navajo.</v>

396
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:26.751
<v Speaker 3>They didn't speak English at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was this like in the western</v>

397
00:20:26.821 --> 00:20:30.230
<v Speaker 3>movies there was try a trail of dust</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming in.</v>

398
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Somebody came on horseback to be our</v>
<v Speaker 3>translator and it was there.</v>

399
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 3>It was their 17 year old niece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

400
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.830
<v Speaker 3>And she came</v>
<v Speaker 3>to mediate during this mtma experience</v>

401
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:51.650
<v Speaker 3>and it became clear that this was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>for her,</v>

402
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 3>not so much for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

403
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them to show their seminar,</v>

404
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's torn between the different</v>

405
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 3>cultures that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that something about our culture.</v>

406
00:21:00.881 --> 00:21:04.540
<v Speaker 3>We wanted what they had or was we saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>and respected it.</v>

407
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the and a lot happened in and the,</v>

408
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 3>it was wonderful in all different ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are some important healings,</v>

409
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:16.490
<v Speaker 3>but in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

410
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 3>when we were going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this young woman</v>

411
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.300
<v Speaker 3>was going to get back on her horse and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had 17 magazine and was reading it</v>

412
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 3>and that's where I started figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

413
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even out in the reservation in these</v>

414
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 3>protected culture is that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>globalization of ideas and Internet and</v>

415
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.160
<v Speaker 3>five casts and people are being exposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ideas that they wouldn't have</v>

416
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 3>normally been exposed to even in China.</v>

417
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having to do so much just kind</v>

418
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:50.830
<v Speaker 3>of sensor stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

419
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 3>There's an explosion of thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas going on right now.</v>

420
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange time.</v>

421
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to come to that and I think</v>

422
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 3>people are getting unsettled because</v>
<v Speaker 3>things they had thought were true and</v>

423
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 3>rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of their frameworks are,</v>

424
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 3>are different than other places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many people speak Navajo?</v>

425
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Exclusively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch.</v>

426
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that that existed.</v>

427
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:15.150
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that inside of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>country's,</v>

428
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 4>there were entire cultures of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that speak in the original native</v>

429
00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:21.820
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

430
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that existed.</v>

431
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably very,</v>

432
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thin at these upper generations because</v>

433
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:28.131
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

434
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:29.460
<v Speaker 3>your younger ones are</v>

435
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.790
<v Speaker 4>arguably the best sounding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their language is like the coolest</v>

436
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.520
<v Speaker 4>sounding language ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got that vendor,</v>

437
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a,</v>

438
00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:41.690
<v Speaker 4>a sound to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something to their accent</v>

439
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.900
<v Speaker 4>that just A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's like we're programmed to</v>

440
00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:49.370
<v Speaker 4>think of native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like spiritual and authentic,</v>

441
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like this sound to it.</v>

442
00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember that scene with Clint</v>

443
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Eastwood?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it the outlaw Josey Wales where he</v>

444
00:22:57.561 --> 00:23:01.190
<v Speaker 4>met that Indian chief and they got</v>
<v Speaker 4>together and these are my words of life</v>

445
00:23:01.191 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 4>and also my words of death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that speech Jamie did?</v>

446
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to find the.</v>

447
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Is so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of my favorite moments in</v>

448
00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:11.960
<v Speaker 4>a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

449
00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:14.060
<v Speaker 4>those clinics should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Movies were all ridiculous,</v>

450
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:16.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you stop and look at it is</v>

451
00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.580
<v Speaker 4>they're all ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was something to that genre</v>

452
00:23:19.581 --> 00:23:24.581
<v Speaker 4>that spaghetti western genre because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't just that it was,</v>

453
00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:29.711
<v Speaker 4>there were cool action movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was cool action movies that were</v>

454
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 4>in some ways reminding you of how people</v>
<v Speaker 4>lived just a hundred years ago because</v>

455
00:23:37.431 --> 00:23:41.090
<v Speaker 4>these were all in the 19 sixties and</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies and shit.</v>

456
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when they did these fucking</v>

457
00:23:42.801 --> 00:23:47.801
<v Speaker 4>movies will visit the 19 in 1870.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were riding fucking horses</v>

458
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this literally is a hundred years</v>

459
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.571
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

460
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 4>18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>65,</v>

461
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 4>they abolished slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only talking about a hundred years</v>

462
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 4>and this cowboy western shit was going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and for us it,</v>

463
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 4>it almost like hearkens to a time right</v>
<v Speaker 4>before we fucked up the country.</v>

464
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:13.090
<v Speaker 4>Right when the first barometers on</v>
<v Speaker 4>wooden wheels rolled their platforms</v>

465
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:18.731
<v Speaker 4>covered in tarp across the entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>continent to find a spot to have babies.</v>

466
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Not that it was like this perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>paradise for got here.</v>

467
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 4>Definitely wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

468
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 4>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting perspective that</v>

469
00:24:27.081 --> 00:24:32.060
<v Speaker 4>some people grab onto that the native</v>
<v Speaker 4>American people were completely a piece</v>

470
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:33.860
<v Speaker 4>where each with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they definitely weren't.</v>

471
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.280
<v Speaker 4>There are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing to take away from their</v>

472
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 4>cultures and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by native American</v>

473
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:41.684
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

474
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.780
<v Speaker 4>It's just an amazing place that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>existed on and for so long without any</v>

475
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 4>European influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while all this stuff was going on in the</v>

476
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were living here in a very,</v>

477
00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 4>very different way in a lot of ways and</v>
<v Speaker 4>intensely harmonious way with their</v>

478
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

479
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 4>with nature itself and I think we like</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that and we have all these deep</v>

480
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 4>spiritual attachments to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's like it means it's very</v>

481
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 4>significant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they fought amongst each other so</v>

482
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 4>much and that was their sport in a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they had that as killing.</v>

483
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a way of becoming trained as a</v>

484
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:20.591
<v Speaker 4>Predator and somehow that's so deep in</v>
<v Speaker 4>us and that's part of the question.</v>

485
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:27.510
<v Speaker 4>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelics and therapy is.</v>

486
00:25:27.511 --> 00:25:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Is there a way to get that out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>human heart?</v>

487
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 4>In a way?</v>

488
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.160
<v Speaker 4>I think the way to get it out as the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's getting out right now,</v>

489
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.970
<v Speaker 4>and it's through information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that when even you look at these</v>

490
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Speaker 4>native American tribes that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmonious with each other,</v>

491
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:42.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have these very close knit bonds</v>

492
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 4>and close tribes and they're very</v>
<v Speaker 4>communal,</v>

493
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.400
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't know these other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were exactly like damn.</v>

494
00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 4>There were a hundred miles away and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>assume the worst and they assume the</v>

495
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:53.600
<v Speaker 4>worst too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they looked at each other and there</v>

496
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:55.370
<v Speaker 4>was not enough communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't.</v>

497
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.620
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't interact with each other</v>
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously.</v>

498
00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't get to understand each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

499
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Like we've talked about this on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast before,</v>

500
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:06.941
<v Speaker 4>but if it wasn't until like about a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years ago where a boat showing</v>

501
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:12.341
<v Speaker 4>up didn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you were in the 18 hundreds</v>

502
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 4>and a strange boat pulled up on shore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're Foxville right?</v>

503
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.210
<v Speaker 4>This is a terrible problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are monsters with swords and</v>

504
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna jump off and they got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot arrows at us.</v>

505
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 4>That was really common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you got a boat that showed up a giant</v>

506
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 4>boat and a bunch of people got off your</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

507
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:33.790
<v Speaker 4>you just got invaded now that means</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorists and you want tourist dollars</v>

508
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 4>and people have translators on their</v>
<v Speaker 4>phones so they could speak to each other</v>

509
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:39.980
<v Speaker 4>that people that speak different</v>
<v Speaker 4>languages,</v>

510
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an amazing time.</v>

511
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.560
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot amazingly strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're experiencing each other on a</v>

512
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 4>much more even playing field than ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the past.</v>

513
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.920
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's how we can exist with</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many of them.</v>

514
00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think if we can see that really</v>

515
00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.460
<v Speaker 3>we're all more in common than we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>different and we can appreciate the</v>

516
00:27:01.461 --> 00:27:04.250
<v Speaker 3>differences rather than be fearful of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

517
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:09.310
<v Speaker 3>And that what we have in common is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental sense of connection of being</v>

518
00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:15.041
<v Speaker 3>this web of life that really were not</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually were pretty similar to</v>

519
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.370
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

520
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.970
<v Speaker 3>her way close the people at different</v>
<v Speaker 3>skin or different cultures</v>

521
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 3>to be able to see that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is who we really are.</v>

522
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.620
<v Speaker 3>And that acting from that and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

523
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 3>work on cooperative solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's,</v>

524
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:40.190
<v Speaker 3>if we can have lots of people having</v>
<v Speaker 3>these direct experiences so that they</v>

525
00:27:41.381 --> 00:27:46.381
<v Speaker 3>can't be manipulated by politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's about grounding this kind of</v>

526
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.760
<v Speaker 3>globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but comfort with</v>

527
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.980
<v Speaker 3>the sense of a connection that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were</v>

528
00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.360
<v Speaker 4>able to find these bonds that they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>exist and that they can be built.</v>

529
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.650
<v Speaker 4>But I think one of the things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing in this extreme oversensitivity</v>

530
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.020
<v Speaker 4>that we're experiencing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

531
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:12.820
<v Speaker 4>this is like a really interesting time</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as like pc culture and what's,</v>

532
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.160
<v Speaker 4>what you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you can't do,</v>

533
00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:17.440
<v Speaker 4>and cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

534
00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:20.500
<v Speaker 4>people are going after people for</v>
<v Speaker 4>cooking Mexican food that aren't</v>

535
00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

536
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.520
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to call that guy cultural</v>
<v Speaker 4>appropriation.</v>

537
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.150
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to do,</v>

538
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 3>take a Iowasca out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

539
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca rituals and out of the jungles</v>
<v Speaker 3>and turn it into a therapy drug.</v>

540
00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.270
<v Speaker 3>But that's out of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not out of.</v>

541
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:38.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

542
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.570
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different thing and in a lot of</v>

543
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:42.410
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>

544
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

545
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 3>culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can evolve.</v>

546
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be acknowledging where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from and try to bring you back.</v>

547
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.510
<v Speaker 4>You're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

548
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.360
<v Speaker 4>What I was gonna say though is that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>oversensitivity is just a,</v>

549
00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.470
<v Speaker 4>it's just a side effect of this expanded</v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding and in this expanded</v>

550
00:29:00.801 --> 00:29:05.050
<v Speaker 4>understanding now all of the different</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are injustices in the world</v>

551
00:29:05.051 --> 00:29:07.400
<v Speaker 4>of being highlighted in a way that never</v>
<v Speaker 4>been highlighted before.</v>

552
00:29:07.401 --> 00:29:11.420
<v Speaker 4>So then people start going after them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then pushing the line further back</v>

553
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.980
<v Speaker 4>and then they start looking for other</v>
<v Speaker 4>slights that might be around,</v>

554
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

555
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>microaggressions,</v>

556
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.320
<v Speaker 4>microaggressions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

557
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.570
<v Speaker 4>What is this white people with</v>
<v Speaker 4>dreadlocks.</v>

558
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:26.450
<v Speaker 4>Justin Bieber adds fuel to the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 4>appropriation debate.</v>

559
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.670
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

560
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.910
<v Speaker 4>all you have to do is Google dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I did.</v>

561
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:36.290
<v Speaker 4>And I found out that the fucking ancient</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greeks were like the oldest people that</v>

562
00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:40.190
<v Speaker 4>wore greg dreadlocks like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe it might have come from the</v>

563
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:43.650
<v Speaker 4>ancient Greeks also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of other cultures work,</v>

564
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 4>dreadlocks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vikings,</v>

565
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:45.990
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dreadlocks.</v>

566
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:46.870
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

567
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cross the board with hair folks.</v>

568
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not a black thing.</v>

569
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not what cultural appropriation</v>

570
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.081
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

571
00:29:55.081 --> 00:29:58.910
<v Speaker 4>That's just style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What cultural appropriation is is like</v>

572
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:03.930
<v Speaker 4>save these native Americans had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific style of clothing that you.</v>

573
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 4>If you wore it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were a woman and you were a sacred</v>

574
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 4>person or you had a head dress that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>wore during very intense spiritual</v>

575
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 4>ceremonies and someone just started</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing that for fun.</v>

576
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Someone thought it was cool to wear that</v>
<v Speaker 4>for fun.</v>

577
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Well then it becomes offensive and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cultural appropriation because</v>

578
00:30:20.721 --> 00:30:24.610
<v Speaker 4>you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people have this ritual is very</v>

579
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sacred ritual in this one,</v>

580
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:30.460
<v Speaker 4>part of that ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are defacing your mocking it openly</v>

581
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.080
<v Speaker 4>and it's offensive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hurts them,</v>

582
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.680
<v Speaker 4>and even that's arguable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cultural appropriation and I</v>

583
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:36.800
<v Speaker 4>agree that there.</v>

584
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.860
<v Speaker 4>I think if someone has something that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacred,</v>

585
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 4>like a head dress or something that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically were,</v>

586
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 4>and then you walk around and wear it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of a Dick move,</v>

587
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have to earn that</v>

588
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.163
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

589
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like being a fake black belts or</v>

590
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 4>having a fake phd or pretending that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>went to Vietnam and you didn't.</v>

591
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

592
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:02.911
<v Speaker 4>They're all equally offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's cultural appropriation is not</v>

593
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:05.800
<v Speaker 4>a white guy were in dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not okay.</v>

594
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 4>That's a kid who likes to wear his hair</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

595
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a fuck and the only reason why</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give a fuck is because you've run</v>

596
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 4>out of things that are really important</v>
<v Speaker 4>to care about in your life because if</v>

597
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:18.280
<v Speaker 4>you cared about really important shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would concentrate on that.</v>

598
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 4>That is a massive distraction.</v>

599
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 4>If a white kid with dreadlocks is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go out of your way to</v>

600
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 4>find anger in a white kid with</v>
<v Speaker 4>dreadlocks.</v>

601
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.470
<v Speaker 4>All that says to me is you need more</v>
<v Speaker 4>interests.</v>

602
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 4>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need more things that are</v>

603
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:32.610
<v Speaker 4>interesting to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

604
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.930
<v Speaker 4>That's called work avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

605
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:37.960
<v Speaker 4>you're just focusing on the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are of work avoidance.</v>

606
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

607
00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

608
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 4>That is a great way of approaching it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly what it is and people do do</v>

609
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.710
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

610
00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:48.140
<v Speaker 4>there's a class at leadership at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kennedy school that I taught.</v>

611
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 4>It was taught by the only psychiatrist</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on the faculty,</v>

612
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Ron Heifetz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was a big concept was that,</v>

613
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a leader,</v>

614
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 4>there's just so much work avoidance</v>
<v Speaker 4>being done in different ways and how do</v>

615
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 4>you help people focus on the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are</v>

616
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 4>tearing them apart or that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>avoiding.</v>

617
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.510
<v Speaker 4>But it would be better if they try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>work on it and you know,</v>

618
00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 4>that word work is weird because work</v>
<v Speaker 4>avoidance doesn't just mean like actual</v>

619
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like working on your job.</v>

620
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.040
<v Speaker 4>It could be working on yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

621
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.220
<v Speaker 4>it could mean like there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that get involved in wacky</v>

622
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 4>behavior because they also are addicted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cigarettes and maybe they drink too</v>

623
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 4>much so they start getting addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>wacky behavior as well,</v>

624
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:34.630
<v Speaker 4>not just as a side effect of the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also to distract them from dealing</v>

625
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 4>with the work they create.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dramas they treat bullshit and all,</v>

626
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 4>almost like to dis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just</v>

627
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:45.370
<v Speaker 1>to drown out the nagging poking of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit you actually need to get done.</v>

628
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So then he just fucking tank your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>again in this way.</v>

629
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Tank your life again and that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 1>My favorite approach to a work avoidance</v>
<v Speaker 1>is doing lots and lots of other work</v>

631
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.040
<v Speaker 1>other than what's the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

632
00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:58.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

633
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Do put off everything except like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really need to do.</v>

634
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

635
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I catch myself doing that now and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

636
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird how your brain will just</v>

637
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:13.241
<v Speaker 1>play little tricks on you like is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's this anxiety a bit about</v>

638
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.060
<v Speaker 1>this is a big challenge and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know until you start how it's going to</v>

639
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 1>turn out and there's lots at stake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

640
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of what you tolerate from</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to.</v>

641
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's a weird line in the sand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta kind of learn to draw.</v>

642
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.270
<v Speaker 1>If you want to actually get things done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to say,</v>

643
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now from,</v>

644
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7:00 PM to 9:00 PM,</v>

645
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm going to do.</v>

646
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to sit down and we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

647
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.770
<v Speaker 1>And you beat the boss of yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you sit down and you stare at the</v>

648
00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 1>computer screen or stare at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notebook.</v>

649
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 1>And you do the writing that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really trying to put off this hard for</v>

650
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 1>people to do though because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times your brain is very wishy washy and</v>

651
00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 1>we see for our choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we receive our ability to open up our</v>

652
00:33:56.211 --> 00:34:00.290
<v Speaker 1>websites and just start going and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and dig.com today.</v>

653
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

654
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 45 minutes after you were supposed</v>

655
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 1>to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I call it the tyranny of the empty page.</v>

657
00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's so nothing.</v>

658
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of a weird thing to be terrified</v>

659
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:20.060
<v Speaker 1>of what really put me at ease was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor when I was working on my</v>

660
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.200
<v Speaker 1>dissertation at the Kennedy School at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and,</v>

661
00:34:23.201 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 1>and I just had this idea that you had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it so good that you know,</v>

662
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were they and what I was doing,</v>

663
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't start that way.</v>

664
00:34:34.851 --> 00:34:39.851
<v Speaker 1>So I had three professors but he needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fourth on my committee and he was the</v>

665
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.860
<v Speaker 1>academic dean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's terrific.</v>

666
00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:44.190
<v Speaker 1>But I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

667
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.750
<v Speaker 1>should I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

668
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.710
<v Speaker 1>because you're so busy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I just worked through with the</v>

669
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 1>other professors and then just give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and the final phase just for you</v>

670
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:54.890
<v Speaker 1>to read over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

671
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to me in the junk phase because</v>

672
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that's when your comments are the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

673
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 1>But what it was got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he acknowledged that there was a junk</v>

674
00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 1>phase and that helped me feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

675
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I can start because I'm producing Janet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

676
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just keep trying to refine it or</v>

677
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:11.871
<v Speaker 1>fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

678
00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

679
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 1>should fear has this little piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper that he has glued or taped to his</v>

680
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Speaker 1>laptop and it says the first draft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first draft of everything is Shit.</v>

681
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 1>It's Ernest Hemingway and it's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the screen.</v>

682
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.100
<v Speaker 1>That's such a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really have to go over things.</v>

683
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Writing is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whenever I read something that's</v>

684
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:36.940
<v Speaker 1>like ponderous and just labored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this.</v>

685
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You read this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to read it after you write it,</v>

686
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.280
<v Speaker 1>you got to write it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to read it.</v>

687
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to rewrite it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

688
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 1>for me getting stone and editing stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've written,</v>

689
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 1>it's harder sometimes I can write when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stoned,</v>

690
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's very early and it sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be like,</v>

691
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:54.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

692
00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:58.080
<v Speaker 1>a half hour for a paragraph or so</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm thinking about all the</v>

693
00:35:58.081 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>different words in ways and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to write with.</v>

694
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write with.</v>

695
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like particular software?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you write with?</v>

696
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you have anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just Microsoft word.</v>

697
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever try right room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what right room is?</v>

698
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no right room is this program where the</v>

699
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:21.570
<v Speaker 1>entire screen goes black and I'll show</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the entire screen,</v>

700
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 1>goes black and all you get is these</v>
<v Speaker 1>green letters and you can't access your</v>

701
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 1>browser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

702
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you can't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it looks like when I write.</v>

703
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's green letters there.</v>

704
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>You could see it up on the big screen as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

705
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's green letters,</v>

706
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 1>black background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I write like that man,</v>

707
00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it just owns me in and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything else.</v>

708
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

709
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just shut the Wifi off and Ram.</v>

710
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 1>That's for me the best way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best way to get into it,</v>

711
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.900
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 1>For me it usually takes a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being like midnight or something</v>

713
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen scrivener?</v>

714
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Scrivener?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is scribner's pretty cool too.</v>

715
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It's something I've been using for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

716
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 1>It's this program that you can set it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

717
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he set it up a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different views,</v>

718
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but the one I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a cork board.</v>

719
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So you have like index cards and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>write on index cards,</v>

720
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 1>see them up there like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were all those index cards are</v>

721
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:27.120
<v Speaker 1>expandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So each one of those index cards can be,</v>

722
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an essay and you click on each one of</v>

723
00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:32.880
<v Speaker 1>them and then you get to notes and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

724
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.520
<v Speaker 1>you can open them up and read the full</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent of it.</v>

725
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:38.550
<v Speaker 1>You can highlight things and make notes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the highlights.</v>

726
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot.</v>

727
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool too because I liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

728
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I like cork boards and I use them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real life and um,</v>

729
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned that from watching Sitcom</v>

730
00:37:50.821 --> 00:37:53.520
<v Speaker 1>writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you can you have it where you've got</v>

731
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:58.100
<v Speaker 1>like the different columns or different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of tasks and then you have them</v>

732
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 1>prioritized so you can kind of in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>glance look at.</v>

733
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to explore that.</v>

734
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Only use it for notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure I'm sure it's pretty</v>

735
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:11.631
<v Speaker 1>flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's mostly a wow who,</v>

736
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 1>who started using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a screenwriting tool</v>

737
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.720
<v Speaker 1>initially I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people use it because it's</v>

738
00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:21.270
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool of you.</v>

739
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>What kind of stuff are you writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mostly just bullshit.</v>

740
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Just my thoughts on things then extract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up out of it,</v>

741
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

742
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll write like long form things.</v>

743
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying that I'm going to get back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to writing a blog,</v>

744
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:38.391
<v Speaker 1>but I just never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have the real itch to just tee.</v>

745
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

746
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 1>like these half process things that then</v>
<v Speaker 1>become bits,</v>

747
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like use it as a farm I guess.</v>

748
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to try to like write a joke</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he used to try to write like</v>

749
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 1>beginning punchline setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I realized like the best way</v>

750
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 1>for me at least with my styles to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of shit and then find out what's</v>

751
00:38:58.751 --> 00:39:00.540
<v Speaker 1>funny about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

752
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 1>is tweeting sorted for you like notes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>blog something useful?</v>

753
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

754
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like tweet.</v>

755
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I like texting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting rather because you only get 140</v>

756
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>text characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those 140 characters.</v>

757
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that's good because it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>economize and it makes you edit and then</v>

758
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 1>it makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you a better joke writer and a</v>

759
00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:25.160
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways like the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>

760
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:29.620
<v Speaker 1>the figuring out the slams and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches in a joke.</v>

761
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get to them better when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn how to say funny shit on</v>

762
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:38.911
<v Speaker 1>twitter because you only have 140</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters that small amount of text in</v>

763
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 1>this little box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to figure out a way to</v>

764
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 1>get your point across and hopefully be</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny too,</v>

765
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's just stupid texts to me.</v>

766
00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Like someone will say something really</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>

767
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:51.630
<v Speaker 1>just so silly and I just can't stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

768
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

769
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting like how tweets have</v>

770
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:59.430
<v Speaker 1>like a time where they work to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

771
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 1>like something could have just happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news and then some will have the</v>

772
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:06.880
<v Speaker 1>perfectly time ridiculous tweet and like</v>

<v Speaker 1>like that dude like cracked up the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>Party of,</v>

774

<v Speaker 1>she's become famous and a working comic</v>

777

790
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>it's so important to balance out people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like meat.</v>

791
00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You want balance out like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what we're in the stage of the,</v>

792
00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm considering our major reality</v>

793
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:09.121
<v Speaker 1>check of our 30 years of existence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's submitting the data from Mtma</v>

794
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 1>assisted psychotherapy for ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These phase two studies that we've been</v>

795
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 1>working on for the last 15 years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>submitting that to first off to our FDA</v>

796
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:24.241
<v Speaker 1>consultants and then to Fda about going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next step about going from</v>

797
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 1>exploratory studies to studies that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work then you get approval as a</v>

798
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 1>prescription medicine as a prescription</v>

799
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.300
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

800
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.360
<v Speaker 3>we're bringing all of these data points</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've gotten roughly just in this</v>

801
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 3>bunch of studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around $7,000,000 studies over a 105</v>

802
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:51.580
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're able to tell is a story</v>

803
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 3>about risk and a story about benefit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic stress disorder from any</v>

804
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:01.601
<v Speaker 3>cause with Mtma assisted psychotherapy</v>
<v Speaker 3>as compared to a placebo and also from</v>

805
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 3>the literature and working with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have failed other medications.</v>

806
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird subjective subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

807
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Like how people feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about,</v>

808
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life because it's,</v>

809
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:22.080
<v Speaker 3>it's assisted psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how much of an impact you</v>

810
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.380
<v Speaker 3>specifically can you attribute to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug,</v>

811
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

812
00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the test will actually determine that</v>

813
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 3>because one group of people will get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy with a placebo.</v>

814
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is how we're thinking of for</v>
<v Speaker 3>phase three and this is how some of the</v>

815
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:41.150
<v Speaker 3>studies we did with phase two.</v>

816
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:46.450
<v Speaker 3>So I think being rigorous and skeptical</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really important.</v>

817
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Super important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first point is if you can do this</v>

818
00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 3>with the therapy without the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then why do you need the drug?</v>

819
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.020
<v Speaker 3>But there's so many variables when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to therapy as well,</v>

820
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:01.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the relationship between the</v>

821
00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:03.290
<v Speaker 3>therapist and the patient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

822
00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>There's so many variables and ranges of</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual responses.</v>

823
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 3>So there's these massive tables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>statistical tables for sample size</v>

824
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:16.340
<v Speaker 3>calculations that help you figure out on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basis of all these assumptions,</v>

825
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 3>how many people you need in this study</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get statistically significant</v>

826
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many do you need?</v>

827
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're still working through the</v>

828
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:25.910
<v Speaker 3>different assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say I'm an alien.</v>

829
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Let's get a million people highs.</v>

830
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just think of the cost though.</v>

831
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Speaker 3>That's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be some billionaire</v>

832
00:43:34.041 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 3>character out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

833
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Once they're like Richard Branson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Branson started stitching out</v>

834
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.000
<v Speaker 3>them Dma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we've got a party there.</v>

835
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

836
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 3>support that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting.</v>

837
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:48.620
<v Speaker 3>That makes me very hopeful about our</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to raise the money for phase</v>

838
00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think it's going to cost around 24 or</v>

839
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:52.250
<v Speaker 3>$5.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million Dollars.</v>

840
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have about half of it already.</v>

841
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either enhanced or committed a serious</v>

842
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:00.140
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

843
00:44:00.141 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences if it works is that</v>

844
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:09.821
<v Speaker 3>then we can start setting up psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapy clinics for Mtma for ptsd.</v>

845
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:14.090
<v Speaker 3>We can start negotiating with the va and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Defense with their</v>

846
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:16.410
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

847
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.560
<v Speaker 3>The enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

848
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:27.010
<v Speaker 3>last year was about $6,000,000,000 that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the va spent in disability payments for</v>

849
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:32.141
<v Speaker 3>about 600,000 veterans that are disabled</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree with ptsd just for Ptsd,</v>

850
00:44:35.871 --> 00:44:39.210
<v Speaker 3>just for bdsd around $6,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>

851
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just in disability payments for,</v>

852
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.410
<v Speaker 3>that's why the human sufferings who the</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

853
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the.</v>

854
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:53.870
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when people are traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've never guessed it was that</v>

855
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:58.830
<v Speaker 3>high $6,000,000,000 just for ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have thought just for disability</v>

856
00:44:58.831 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 3>payments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

857
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>that's not cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One other thing.</v>

858
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're able to,</v>

859
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.770
<v Speaker 3>what we've been able to show what we say</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this group of a hundred and five</v>

860
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 3>people is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is ptsd from any cause,</v>

861
00:45:15.061 --> 00:45:16.640
<v Speaker 3>not just war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

862
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:21.710
<v Speaker 3>childhood sexual abuse or rape or</v>
<v Speaker 3>workplace accident trauma of any kind</v>

863
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:28.041
<v Speaker 3>that a substantial percentage of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can have significant improvement.</v>

864
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 3>And how that's valuated is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately for us,</v>

865
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:38.150
<v Speaker 3>there is a independent rater</v>
<v Speaker 3>administered scale for not for symptoms</v>

866
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:45.030
<v Speaker 3>of ptsd and it's called the cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the clinician administered PTSD</v>

867
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 3>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the gold standard developed by the</v>

868
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Va,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used by the FDA to approve Zoloft and</v>

869
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:56.661
<v Speaker 3>Paxil for ptsd and it's just been</v>
<v Speaker 3>revised from caps for to campus five,</v>

870
00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:02.230
<v Speaker 3>so it's a work in progress over decades</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so this.</v>

871
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 3>This is the objective scale and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>do have to tell their story to an</v>

872
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:14.061
<v Speaker 3>independent rater and the way that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent rating system is going to be</v>

873
00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:18.690
<v Speaker 3>done is going to be a whole pool of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are calibrated with each other.</v>

874
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Interrater reliability and they know how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to administer this and they were</v>

875
00:46:22.421 --> 00:46:27.421
<v Speaker 3>randomly assigned to what we think will</v>
<v Speaker 3>be about 230 people for one phase three</v>

876
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:31.050
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably what we're going to be</v>

877
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:36.051
<v Speaker 3>proposing and we need to have those</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies to large scale phase three</v>

878
00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:41.061
<v Speaker 3>studies and what we're going to have is</v>
<v Speaker 3>these raiders will be randomly assigned</v>

879
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 3>to one of the subjects and they won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily know is this the one year</v>

880
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 3>follow up the two month follow up.</v>

881
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 3>That really is the primary outcome</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure or the baseline.</v>

882
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.870
<v Speaker 3>So the independent raters are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important because for skeptical people</v>

883
00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 3>in science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the double blind is a key development.</v>

884
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.560
<v Speaker 3>How you do an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't know the two conditions</v>

885
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 3>she shouldn't know which is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experimental one in which isn't because</v>

886
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:16.220
<v Speaker 3>your biases might make you suddenly see</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want to see.</v>

887
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's very hard not to do that.</v>

888
00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:23.340
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of a human tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea has been these placebo</v>

889
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 3>controlled double blind studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's good in theory,</v>

890
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but with a psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>use,</v>

891
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.140
<v Speaker 3>people tell if they've got a placebo</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does nothing or a psychedelic drug.</v>

892
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a fundamental problem of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>research and that's why these</v>

893
00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 3>independent raters are even more</v>
<v Speaker 3>important for people to have confidence</v>

894
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 3>in the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we've tried is a series of</v>

895
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 3>studies giving low dose Mtma and</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparing it to medium and full dose.</v>

896
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.770
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea we thought was that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are confused about which dose</v>

897
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 3>they're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then we can show a dose response</v>

898
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's the double blind.</v>

899
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:09.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the solution to the double blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is that everybody knows they're</v>

900
00:48:09.951 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 3>getting Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't know what dose they're</v>

901
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:15.700
<v Speaker 3>getting and so you have to show the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to get the higher dose,</v>

902
00:48:15.701 --> 00:48:20.701
<v Speaker 3>do better than the people that get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower dose and the people patients might</v>

903
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 3>not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therapists could be confused that that's</v>

904
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:26.100
<v Speaker 3>the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

905
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.140
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're heading for and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we've spent the last 10 years or so</v>

906
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:35.280
<v Speaker 3>researching with different low doses of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mtma,</v>

907
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.300
<v Speaker 3>25 milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 milligrams,</v>

908
00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:40.920
<v Speaker 3>40 milligrams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>75 milligrams,</v>

909
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.960
<v Speaker 3>101 slash 25 and we would always have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this possibility of half the initial</v>

910
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 3>dose administered one and a half to two</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half hours later to prolong the</v>

911
00:48:52.271 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 3>experience and make it an eight hour</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy session.</v>

912
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 3>So when these people were getting this a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sec,</v>

913
00:48:57.671 --> 00:49:00.790
<v Speaker 3>they're getting it or Mtma they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it in a clinical setting.</v>

914
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting it in a clinical</v>

915
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:07.231
<v Speaker 3>setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How often a w s three times three to</v>

916
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 3>five weeks apart in case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>

917
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 3>And it's a three and a half month</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy process of weekly psychotherapy.</v>

918
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:20.310
<v Speaker 3>So the emphasis is on the psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the preparation,</v>

919
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.860
<v Speaker 3>the therapeutic alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then after three weeks there's the</v>

920
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:31.201
<v Speaker 3>initial MTMA session and it takes place</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a special treatment center treatment</v>

921
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 3>room where there's a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female co therapist team with the</v>

922
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:38.660
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person,</v>

923
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.470
<v Speaker 3>the patient is having their blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure monitored,</v>

924
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 3>they're having their temperature</v>
<v Speaker 3>monitored,</v>

925
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.190
<v Speaker 3>they're being videotaped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>

926
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:47.710
<v Speaker 3>And there's video tapes on the therapist</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

927
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:52.660
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to understand about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>method and the experiment.</v>

928
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.500
<v Speaker 3>This portion of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the session is about eight hours</v>

929
00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.653
<v Speaker 3>treasonous.</v>

930
00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.880
<v Speaker 3>Who's auditing all this footage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

931
00:49:59.881 --> 00:50:03.580
<v Speaker 3>we've loading it up or we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

932
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.373
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

933
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.960
<v Speaker 3>we're not having somebody audit all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

934
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:12.160
<v Speaker 3>We have the therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of note which are the decisive</v>

935
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I stuff on youtube,</v>

936
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:15.780
<v Speaker 3>we're developing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

937
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

938
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:20.590
<v Speaker 3>So in order to train therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to train therapists is to</v>

939
00:50:20.591 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 3>show here's videotapes of actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>patients under MTMA.</v>

940
00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 3>And this is how they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's poetry,</v>

941
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Po,</v>

942
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.120
<v Speaker 3>it's symbolic poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People talk in terms of imagery because</v>

943
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 3>half the time their eyes are closed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm listening to music having just their</v>

944
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 3>own private experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other half of the time and more or</v>

945
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:44.160
<v Speaker 3>less they're communicating with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapists</v>

946
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.840
<v Speaker 3>and it varies and there's no particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>order of things.</v>

947
00:50:49.841 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 3>So it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what I felt with the native</v>

948
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Americans with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we did Mtma with the pod circle,</v>

949
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 3>that they had these elaborate rituals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

950
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went through the whole night that</v>

951
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 3>were beautiful and filled with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich symbols.</v>

952
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they went,</v>

953
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.540
<v Speaker 3>so they did some of their opening</v>
<v Speaker 3>prayers and they want to know what we're</v>

954
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.060
<v Speaker 3>going to do and we didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

955
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just sit around and somebody says</v>

956
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:21.140
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a more free form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt that we had like a poverty of</v>

957
00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:25.210
<v Speaker 3>ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also freedom to,</v>

958
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 3>to explore like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we try to provide in</v>

959
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:34.061
<v Speaker 3>this mtma experience that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>their unconscious as the guide.</v>

960
00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 3>And we're not the guide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not steering them anywhere.</v>

961
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:40.720
<v Speaker 3>There's all these techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know we're not a,</v>

962
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:46.210
<v Speaker 3>we're responding to this emergence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>material that's been catalyzed by the</v>

963
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:47.720
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the setting.</v>

964
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:52.721
<v Speaker 3>And then the drug and we're supporting</v>
<v Speaker 3>this emergence and different people will</v>

965
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:58.640
<v Speaker 3>sometimes go to the trauma first or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about it till the fifth hour or</v>

966
00:51:58.641 --> 00:52:03.641
<v Speaker 3>they'll go to childhood experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were supportive to build strength or</v>

967
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:08.390
<v Speaker 3>they'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but often it's in the symbolic language</v>

968
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.360
<v Speaker 3>and they're sort of telling themselves a</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

969
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that story can reorder the neural</v>

970
00:52:16.521 --> 00:52:21.521
<v Speaker 3>networks and their brain and deemphasize</v>
<v Speaker 3>activity in certain fear centers of the</v>

971
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Medola and can change how memories are</v>
<v Speaker 3>stored.</v>

972
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 3>We're just sending Mtma to Rockefeller</v>
<v Speaker 3>University where one of the leading</v>

973
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 3>scientists and anxiety is going to start</v>
<v Speaker 3>some studies when animals,</v>

974
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:35.760
<v Speaker 3>mice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats,</v>

975
00:52:35.761 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

976
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.820
<v Speaker 3>and trying to look at fear extinction</v>
<v Speaker 3>and memory reconsolidation and how mtma</v>

977
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.020
<v Speaker 3>effects that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

978
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're starting to get,</v>

979
00:52:46.521 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I fear extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but through giving someone mdm may at</v>

980
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.990
<v Speaker 3>least lessons anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

981
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:57.590
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that when you have memory,</v>

982
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.160
<v Speaker 3>you react with fear all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

983
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fear has never fully been</v>

984
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 3>processed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always like,</v>

985
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:09.410
<v Speaker 3>it's about happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not been fully processed because</v>

986
00:53:09.411 --> 00:53:11.430
<v Speaker 3>it's been so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

987
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.240
<v Speaker 3>More emotionally rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>

988
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:19.630
<v Speaker 3>so with the Mtma you can help people</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this way of reducing the fear</v>

989
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:22.600
<v Speaker 3>response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their activity and they mingle is</v>

990
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 3>reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

991
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.290
<v Speaker 3>And so people can</v>

992
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.550
<v Speaker 1>have the content without the fearful</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

993
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:33.180
<v Speaker 1>So as some sort of a bridge or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocker,</v>

994
00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.710
<v Speaker 1>a yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

995
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but it changes the structure of a memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that person because</v>

996
00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it changes how the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ma'Am,</v>

997
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:47.820
<v Speaker 1>every time you have a memory you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consolidate from different parts of your</v>

998
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:49.980
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you reconsolidate the memory.</v>

999
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people have weird false</v>

1000
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:52.681
<v Speaker 1>memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1001
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would swear were real.</v>

1002
00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1003
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Your memories change over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a memory of a memory that</v>

1004
00:53:58.741 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you're retelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you're like,</v>

1005
00:54:00.841 --> 00:54:04.080
<v Speaker 1>if someone you know that had a story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did something and they told it to</v>

1006
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:06.810
<v Speaker 1>you and then you tell your friends about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story,</v>

1007
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1008
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I know Bob's story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you Bob Story,</v>

1009
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really know Bob's story</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you only know it from him.</v>

1010
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1011
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you weren't there when it happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's some of what happens</v>

1012
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:19.320
<v Speaker 1>with Lee's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my memories as they get older and older.</v>

1013
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

1014
00:54:20.391 --> 00:54:23.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a memory of a memory that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1015
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.050
<v Speaker 1>You have to double check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.200
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that people's memory</v>

1017
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 1>for the trauma actually gets better with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mtma.</v>

1018
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.330
<v Speaker 1>You can somehow another change what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory is.</v>

1019
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:43.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the beauty part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you change your reaction to them?</v>

1021
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>But I mean with that is to you like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling tone.</v>

1022
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1023
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 1>so because these memories were so scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been suppressed but,</v>

1024
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but not successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not fully integrated.</v>

1025
00:54:56.911 --> 00:55:01.911
<v Speaker 1>Still activating fury actions on</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently and so when you can feel</v>

1026
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:08.541
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and then bringing up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories and then because you're feeling</v>

1027
00:55:09.151 --> 00:55:11.790
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people remember even better.</v>

1028
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what you guys should really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to prove the effect</v>

1029
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:19.431
<v Speaker 1>of city of effectiveness of Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go to Worldstar hip hop.com</v>

1030
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:23.670
<v Speaker 1>and find all those people that got</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and give them ecstasy and see</v>

1031
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:25.830
<v Speaker 1>if it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's so many people that got</v>

1032
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.800
<v Speaker 1>punted in the head and thrown off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking building.</v>

1033
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 1>We have the Zendo project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that for Worldstar hip hop.com</v>

1034
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:39.680
<v Speaker 1>exclusively for electronic dance music</v>
<v Speaker 1>festivals and burning man.</v>

1035
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely different.</v>

1036
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Definitely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1037
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:48.950
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the idea of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>better process trauma is universally</v>

1038
00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:51.600
<v Speaker 1>appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all of us have had bad moments</v>

1039
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:54.920
<v Speaker 1>in our life that probably overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

1040
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have some character because</v>

1041
00:55:57.181 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 1>of those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be nice if you had a full</v>

1042
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 1>handle on how it makes you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1044
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's where this memory enhancement</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in handy because then you can</v>

1045
00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:12.110
<v Speaker 1>really learn from what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you how you chose Mtma out of</v>

1046
00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 1>all the different psychoactive</v>
<v Speaker 1>substances?</v>

1047
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1048
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I felt that MTMA had a chance of being</v>

1049
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:29.580
<v Speaker 3>welcomed into the culture as the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the different psychedelics because it</v>

1050
00:56:30.311 --> 00:56:33.640
<v Speaker 3>has that fear reducing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so psychedelic.</v>

1051
00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not a classic psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make you feel like you're</v>

1053
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 3>losing control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it so that you feel a subtle</v>

1054
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:48.331
<v Speaker 3>shift of openness to self acceptance and</v>
<v Speaker 3>self love and self acceptance I think is</v>

1055
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 3>like the core of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your muscles relax.</v>

1056
00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:02.130
<v Speaker 3>People can stretch a couple inches more</v>
<v Speaker 3>really when are more limber on Mtma.</v>

1057
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1058
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.631
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you,</v>

1059
00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:06.660
<v Speaker 3>have they ever done that with athletes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1060
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should do it with athletes like</v>

1061
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:12.180
<v Speaker 3>people that are already really flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe jazz or something like,</v>

1062
00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:14.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's the Yoga people and I've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts people.</v>

1063
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do.</v>

1064
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of the muscles relax</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that part of your attention is,</v>

1065
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:27.070
<v Speaker 3>or it's tense because of parts of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain and so that the way in which you</v>

1066
00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:32.821
<v Speaker 3>can then have this full memory when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're feeling peaceful and you're</v>

1067
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 3>looking at it as if it's happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>

1068
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:37.480
<v Speaker 3>which it did.</v>

1069
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.070
<v Speaker 3>So you finally got this perspective on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it because this piece makes it so that</v>

1070
00:57:42.071 --> 00:57:44.080
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not seeing it as happening right</v>

1071
00:57:44.081 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 3>now because you realize it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening right now.</v>

1072
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:52.110
<v Speaker 3>It happened then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're creating this longer,</v>

1073
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.740
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of memory storage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that was clearly in the past</v>

1074
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 3>and it's connected now to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflective,</v>

1075
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 3>peaceful tone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the memory has reconsolidated</v>

1076
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.630
<v Speaker 3>restored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next time you call it,</v>

1077
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you'd get the incident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get the emotional tone of this</v>

1078
00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:15.841
<v Speaker 3>peacefulness and that it's in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you can do work within a period</v>

1079
00:58:16.691 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 3>of minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes hours of seeing a shift,</v>

1080
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking at something differently and</v>

1081
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:28.441
<v Speaker 3>processing these traumatic memories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rare,</v>

1082
00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 3>but one person was in our study and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped out after just one session</v>

1083
00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:38.450
<v Speaker 3>because like I got this is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what he got.</v>

1084
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Tony macy is his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of the vets.</v>

1085
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:47.281
<v Speaker 3>And part of what he got was that he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been telling himself that he was on</v>

1086
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:50.530
<v Speaker 3>opiates for pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for injuries,</v>

1087
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:55.590
<v Speaker 3>but that he was starting to realize it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was really more of a escapism and that</v>

1088
00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:01.380
<v Speaker 3>he didn't need them and he didn't need</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs and he didn't need Mtma or wow.</v>

1089
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.390
<v Speaker 3>He didn't need anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

1090
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 3>he'd had what he needed and will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kudos.</v>

1091
00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we asked them later if,</v>

1092
00:59:09.491 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1093
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 3>if he would at least be part of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>followup evaluations,</v>

1094
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 3>and he said yes to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1095
00:59:17.351 --> 00:59:20.430
<v Speaker 3>that's nice of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he didn't have a,</v>

1096
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't qualify ptsd at</v>

1097
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 1>the two month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it got closer to like the</v>

1098
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 1>one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is our last follow up,</v>

1099
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:28.340
<v Speaker 1>he started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1100
00:59:28.341 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still feeling pretty okay,</v>

1101
00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think I could learn more from md,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>

1102
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe can I have now some more of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions.</v>

1103
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1104
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a rigid protocol you've dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1105
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just wait and see if you even</v>

1106
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.780
<v Speaker 1>would qualify to be in the study if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>even have ptsd.</v>

1107
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.480
<v Speaker 1>So we did the 12 month followup and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have,</v>

1108
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't even qualify to be and still</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to give some exit off you because</v>

1109
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:55.781
<v Speaker 1>there's other things to learn how good</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels to me.</v>

1110
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Trying to party party under the auspice</v>
<v Speaker 1>of scientific study.</v>

1111
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order to be the most rigorous</v>

1112
01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to look at studies.</v>

1113
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>One is called the per protocol.</v>

1114
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that finishes the study and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meets the criteria and the other is</v>

1115
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>called intent to treat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means everybody that comes,</v>

1116
01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at their data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they drop out or they lied to</v>

1117
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>get into the study or they wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified or whatever it is.</v>

1118
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Once you have enrolled somebody that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more conservative,</v>

1119
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you just have to include everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be picking the people</v>

1120
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>that fulfilled your treatment plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1121
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So this guy was a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't normally count them,</v>

1122
01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>but now that we're doing the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative intent to treat analysis,</v>

1123
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>we can include the dropouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually Tony Scores of massive</v>

1124
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>reduction in ptsd symptoms after just</v>
<v Speaker 1>one session counts in our data.</v>

1125
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he was screened and had the</v>

1126
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>first session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many variabilities,</v>

1127
01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>happiness being such a crazy sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquantifiable thing,</v>

1128
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1129
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants some happiness and one</v>

1130
01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>of the things that Mtma does seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide a lot of people is relief from</v>

1131
01:01:08.481 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in a lot of ways equals happiness.</v>

1132
01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1133
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know universally,</v>

1134
01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>if you had to say what is the one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people get from a drug called</v>

1135
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.370
<v Speaker 1>ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you feel great,</v>

1136
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel relief,</v>

1137
01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>you feel comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurities melt.</v>

1138
01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>They just dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

1139
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist anymore and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach people in this really weird</v>

1140
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>open way where you're not constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to judo,</v>

1141
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever kind of bad shit they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending your way,</v>

1142
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>like so many people when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>

1143
01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:41.741
<v Speaker 1>they always have some sort of a wall up</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some sort of a barrier between their</v>

1144
01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>real feelings and what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>projecting so that they can sort of</v>

1145
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to navigate this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with the least amount of</v>

1146
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>social damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1147
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like this is like a zen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some styles of communication like this</v>

1148
01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:04.901
<v Speaker 1>way of going through it with having the</v>
<v Speaker 1>least amount of conflict in your life.</v>

1149
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>But if everybody was on ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the vibe like this.</v>

1150
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a vibe that you get and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying everybody should do it or what</v>

1151
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a vibe that you get when you</v>

1152
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>communicating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally,</v>

1153
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it makes it almost impossible to</v>

1154
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 3>have arguments with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets weird like you communicate with</v>

1155
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:28.791
<v Speaker 3>people in this open way that you will</v>
<v Speaker 3>never even attempt if he weren't both on</v>

1156
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Mtma yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually have a study starting in the</v>

1157
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:38.040
<v Speaker 3>next month or so where we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give to people Mtma at the same time to</v>

1158
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 3>a couple a dialogue of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well these are already people that are</v>

1159
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 3>related,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them has ptsd and one of them</v>

1160
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 3>it affects the relationship but doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have ptsd.</v>

1161
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.730
<v Speaker 3>And so this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1162
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.030
<v Speaker 3>a major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major breakthrough because I'm,</v>

1163
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 3>the first study with psychedelics was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern era was 1990 with Rick</v>

1164
01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:01.970
<v Speaker 3>strassman with a dmt study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1165
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 3>and ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now for the past 26 years,</v>

1166
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:11.160
<v Speaker 3>it's only been one person getting Mtma</v>
<v Speaker 3>or psilocybin or Lsd or anything at a</v>

1167
01:03:11.161 --> 01:03:14.550
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the first time we've been</v>

1168
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:17.910
<v Speaker 3>able to work with two people at a time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and give them Mtma.</v>

1169
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.940
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the study that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>informal collaboration with the Veterans</v>

1170
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>National Center for Ptsd.</v>

1171
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a therapist that used to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the national center who's now at</v>

1172
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:35.391
<v Speaker 3>Ryerson University in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who develop this approach and who was</v>

1173
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:40.611
<v Speaker 3>introduced to us through the work of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Rockefeller who was opening the</v>

1174
01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 3>doors for us with the National Center</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Ptsd and we met this woman,</v>

1175
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 3>candice Monson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the researcher,</v>

1176
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 3>and she's developed what's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive behavioral conjoint therapy</v>

1177
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.600
<v Speaker 3>and conjoint means couples and so it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive behavioral sort of scripted</v>

1178
01:03:57.331 --> 01:04:02.070
<v Speaker 3>how you kind of think about your trauma</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exercises about it,</v>

1179
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 3>but it's for couples and so when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were thinking how to blend Mtma with</v>

1180
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 3>traditional non drug psychotherapies</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are used by the va,</v>

1181
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 3>the couple's therapy they thought would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the most logical because it helps you</v>

1182
01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 3>to have those kinds of communications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the better listeners.</v>

1183
01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:19.790
<v Speaker 3>You're more empathic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1184
01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:24.810
<v Speaker 3>You can get over stuck arguments and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ptsd really does affect the relationship</v>

1185
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:30.531
<v Speaker 3>and in a lot of ways and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The researchers have all these measures</v>

1186
01:04:31.531 --> 01:04:35.310
<v Speaker 3>of the relationship with the style of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication between the people.</v>

1187
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.440
<v Speaker 3>We really care about the caps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the clinician administered ptsd scale,</v>

1188
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be tremendously</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting and we've been able to get</v>

1189
01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:48.900
<v Speaker 3>permission for the first time to give to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people MTMA and we'll be able to monitor</v>

1190
01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:50.970
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but couples therapy,</v>

1191
01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:53.360
<v Speaker 3>even though it's a tremendous use of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mgma,</v>

1192
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:57.750
<v Speaker 3>will never make it through the FDA</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can only take diseases.</v>

1193
01:04:57.751 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to treat a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not for personal psychotherapy,</v>

1194
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.650
<v Speaker 3>which is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know those things.</v>

1195
01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.010
<v Speaker 3>It could be anxiety disorder or ptsd or</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

1196
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:12.620
<v Speaker 3>We have to treat diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a weird distinction there.</v>

1197
01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 3>If there's something wrong and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a substance that makes that wrong,</v>

1198
01:05:15.931 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1199
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have something wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have</v>

1200
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>to be something you look at in a petri</v>
<v Speaker 1>dish.</v>

1201
01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only because of the drug war.</v>

1202
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It's only because it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.</v>

1203
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously there's a condition and a</v>

1204
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>solution to that condition mean this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're not dying from</v>

1205
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>feeling like shit about your marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean there's not a problem.</v>

1206
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1207
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:38.580
<v Speaker 1>that's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1208
01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>it will be one of the best uses of Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like making toothpaste</v>

1209
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1210
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1211
01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>unless you have like a serious dental</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and you really need to clean</v>

1212
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>the holes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have some sort of a horrible</v>

1213
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:58.450
<v Speaker 1>root canal that's about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that you can somehow or</v>

1214
01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 1>another key people from doing what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanna do.</v>

1215
01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 1>That's at the heart of it all right.</v>

1216
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.330
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1217
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.770
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of,</v>

1218
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:12.170
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychedelics because Hashtag</v>

1219
01:06:12.171 --> 01:06:15.160
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics because of coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closet of people</v>

1220
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:21.250
<v Speaker 3>saying that that this has been helpful</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that this is something good and we</v>

1221
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:23.720
<v Speaker 3>should be able to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1222
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.160
<v Speaker 3>I think the eventual use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're sort of backing into this use in</v>

1223
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 3>couples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really about making empty</v>

1224
01:06:32.441 --> 01:06:36.940
<v Speaker 3>manger medicine for Ptsd and it's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>about trying to understand what's the</v>

1225
01:06:36.941 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 3>drug and what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the context.</v>

1226
01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 3>So while we had this context I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>describing of this non directive therapy</v>

1227
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 3>of the unconscious being the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people like cognitive behavioral,</v>

1228
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:51.640
<v Speaker 3>they give you all these exercises to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about.</v>

1229
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 3>And how you think about your trauma and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're and when it,</v>

1230
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 3>your triggers are and all different</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of thought exercises.</v>

1231
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:04.300
<v Speaker 3>And so we're seeing that MTMA is like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>general tool and so we're,</v>

1232
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.280
<v Speaker 3>because it's nonprofit drug development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to work with as many other</v>

1233
01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:11.230
<v Speaker 3>therapists was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many other,</v>

1234
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>combinations of treatments that they</v>

1235
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>want to use to explore if they want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>blend Mtma with it.</v>

1236
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:22.240
<v Speaker 3>And so we have this 960 grams of</v>

1237
01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the world's purest am.</v>

1238
01:07:24.171 --> 01:07:29.171
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me where it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>made by Dave Nichols at.</v>

1239
01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't even give up the dude's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to hold them hostage and</v>

1240
01:07:32.151 --> 01:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>make them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this was a,</v>

1241
01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>a lady had legal permission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal MDM.</v>

1242
01:07:36.531 --> 01:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>This is all legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying,</v>

1243
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.340
<v Speaker 1>1985.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a kilogram made.</v>

1244
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what does that two pounds.</v>

1245
01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm two point two pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two pounds.</v>

1246
01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1247
01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And googling Mowgli young Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this.</v>

1248
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>This was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the department of Medicinal chemistry</v>

1249
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>at purdue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1250
01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>They got a better yield than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

1251
01:08:02.571 --> 01:08:04.080
<v Speaker 1>They got more than a killer doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1252
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started off with it and the whole</v>

1253
01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>night I only paid $4,000 for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys ever do a rave while you're</v>

1254
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:12.530
<v Speaker 1>making it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

1255
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read that you at all.</v>

1256
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>But way to go.</v>

1257
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:18.830
<v Speaker 1>We just stick to the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1258
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:19.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1259
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
01:08:20.391 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>there's like the legal track and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1261
01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the yield was totally off.</v>

1262
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all right.</v>

1263
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:33.491
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a 960 grams left 31 years later.</v>

1264
01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It's Christ and it's still the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing we're using in our study.</v>

1265
01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:41.270
<v Speaker 1>So 31 years later it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1266
01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:44.900
<v Speaker 1>it's kept in a room temperature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>without light,</v>

1267
01:08:44.901 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 1>without moisture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just infuriating that it's taken</v>

1268
01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 1>this long for people to recognize what</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people have said for the other</v>

1269
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>people said for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I understand the idea of having</v>

1270
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>rigorous scientific testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time it should</v>

1271
01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be enough anecdotal</v>

1272
01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:01.980
<v Speaker 1>evidence and lack of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1273
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people died from Mgma?</v>

1274
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Has Anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1275
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.890
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1276
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:07.783
<v Speaker 1>What are the risks?</v>

1277
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.470
<v Speaker 1>What is the ld 50?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1278
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ld 50 is a measure where you give a</v>

1279
01:09:15.561 --> 01:09:20.561
<v Speaker 1>bunch of animals increasing amounts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount where you kill half of them,</v>

1280
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1281
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the ld 50 of 'em empty main humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1282
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually even know that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1283
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 1>but it has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have people they died from it or</v>

1284
01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:38.960
<v Speaker 1>they die for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people have died from dehydration</v>

1285
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>have died from hyperthermia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1286
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 1>So mtma affects your temperature</v>
<v Speaker 1>controls,</v>

1287
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.750
<v Speaker 1>which is one reason we measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>

1288
01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.820
<v Speaker 1>although in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a clinical setting,</v>

1289
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:52.820
<v Speaker 1>line down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no problem with temperature at</v>

1290
01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1291
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>and normally there wouldn't be either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was adequate harm reduction and</v>

1292
01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 1>people were drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just water,</v>

1293
01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:02.700
<v Speaker 1>but I'm electrolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1294
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.450
<v Speaker 1>and they would take time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are always so sweaty is I was</v>

1295
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:08.380
<v Speaker 1>going on there sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the dance a lot too.</v>

1296
01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It's that combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people have maybe glowsticks,</v>

1297
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.550
<v Speaker 1>pacifier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glitter,</v>

1298
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 1>glitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my analogy about toothpaste is a</v>

1299
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 1>bad one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know toothpaste and teeth,</v>

1300
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 1>but there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some weirdness to this idea</v>

1301
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
<v Speaker 1>that we need a substance like gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>classified whether no matter whether</v>

1302
01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it's legal or illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gets classified and when you make</v>

1303
01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:41.111
<v Speaker 1>something a drug and that drug can only</v>
<v Speaker 1>be used when there's an ailment,</v>

1304
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:45.140
<v Speaker 1>then you lock out the whole possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of performance enhancing substances</v>

1305
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can't.</v>

1306
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't disclude across the board</v>

1307
01:10:48.921 --> 01:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>performing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing,</v>

1308
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:52.280
<v Speaker 1>enhancing substances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's essentially what coffee is</v>

1309
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and it's mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1310
01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:56.600
<v Speaker 1>coffee breaks or written into union</v>
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>

1311
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they make a contract,</v>

1312
01:10:58.911 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 1>they've write in coffee breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always had coffee breaks,</v>

1313
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a break to take a drug for</v>

1314
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.340
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

1315
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And it used to be illegal at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people gathered together and talk</v>

1316
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:11.060
<v Speaker 1>and revolution in England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

1317
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's like many other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1318
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.400
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drug will ecstasy</v>

1319
01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>is probably a performance enhancing drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well because it gets rid of some of</v>

1320
01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit that you've got clogging up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thinking.</v>

1321
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it allows you to think more freely.</v>

1322
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can.</v>

1323
01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.473
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1324
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it's the most inherently therapeutic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the psychedelics.</v>

1325
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>So when you asked me why did I choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mtma,</v>

1326
01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I think one part is it is the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently therapeutic.</v>

1327
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>People tend not to have bad trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of bad trips people have is</v>

1328
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>when they take Mtma in a recreational</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting and difficult emotions come up</v>

1329
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and there with friends that just want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>party and they tried to stuff the</v>

1330
01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:53.250
<v Speaker 1>emotions down and someone plays slayer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and real loud or that would be worse</v>

1331
01:11:53.251 --> 01:11:54.084
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1332
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And then they end up worse off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So MTMA can make people worse off toe.</v>

1333
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Well there's certain people that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be allowed to chew gum and we</v>

1334
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:06.090
<v Speaker 1>should take them into account too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain people that are going to</v>

1335
01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 1>stub their toe every time they walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think we should know if the</v>

1336
01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 1>world okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super important to recognize when</v>

1337
01:12:12.841 --> 01:12:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at all these numbers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics that there is a certain</v>

1338
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:19.410
<v Speaker 1>percentage of these people in this world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are helpless.</v>

1339
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.490
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do anything about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is everything,</v>

1340
01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:25.050
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm skiing,</v>

1341
01:12:25.051 --> 01:12:27.480
<v Speaker 1>look at the number of people that die</v>
<v Speaker 1>running into trees.</v>

1342
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year there's about 35 or 40 people</v>

1343
01:12:30.121 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 1>that die skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year.</v>

1344
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost Sonny Bono.</v>

1345
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:34.230
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to remind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1346
01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I have to bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw salt.</v>

1347
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's not even counting people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>avalanches.</v>

1348
01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:42.180
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because there are benefits</v>

1349
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:43.860
<v Speaker 1>and that's where again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this coming out,</v>

1350
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:45.560
<v Speaker 1>it's fun schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun but the,</v>

1351
01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was driving race cars.</v>

1352
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 1>That's fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a lot of stuff that's fun but</v>

1353
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.690
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1354
01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of dangerous activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of people that actually</v>

1355
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:58.340
<v Speaker 1>die from ecstasy versus skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low and very.</v>

1356
01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:02.880
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people take who skis ski more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take ecstasy more.</v>

1357
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of what people think</v>

1358
01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:10.320
<v Speaker 1>is ecstasy is exiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning Mtma is really something else.</v>

1359
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's another problem is right</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the half of it.</v>

1360
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1361
01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:19.050
<v Speaker 1>With erowid.org,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an ecstasy pill testing program</v>

1362
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:22.200
<v Speaker 1>that they have been conducting that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped start years ago.</v>

1363
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.830
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one licensed laboratory licensed</v>

1364
01:13:25.831 --> 01:13:28.930
<v Speaker 1>by the dea and the United States that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take anonymous samples of drugs.</v>

1365
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 1>You can get drugs tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's been this program to get</v>

1366
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.200
<v Speaker 1>ecstasy.</v>

1367
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Pills tested over eight or $900 have</v>
<v Speaker 1>already been tested and around half of</v>

1368
01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:41.850
<v Speaker 1>them don't even have mtma in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1369
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:46.851
<v Speaker 1>So there's they mostly amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fed means their caffeine.</v>

1370
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 1>A lot of pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1371
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:51.690
<v Speaker 1>They're selling them as excess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they would,</v>

1372
01:13:51.691 --> 01:13:54.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there there's test kits that dance safe</v>

1373
01:13:54.031 --> 01:13:55.810
<v Speaker 1>cells and sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1374
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to pool the test kits which turns a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain color if there's Mtma in it.</v>

1375
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.740
<v Speaker 1>There's been pills that are one part</v>
<v Speaker 1>mtma nine parts.</v>

1376
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1377
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Because there is the stimulant aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people stay up.</v>

1378
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the risks of Mtma</v>

1379
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.390
<v Speaker 3>even in a large recreational setting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1380
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.080
<v Speaker 3>if it were a post prohibition world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those risks would be very manageable.</v>

1381
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 3>But there would be some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a rare situations,</v>

1382
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 3>somebody might die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have that all the time with cars,</v>

1383
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:29.620
<v Speaker 3>with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1384
01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that it would never happen.</v>

1385
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like those freaks that are allergic</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shrimp,</v>

1386
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:37.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Venice Hillen people die for.</v>

1387
01:14:37.530 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be risk for everything.</v>

1388
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.160
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

1389
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Even salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salt kills people who die from salt over</v>

1390
01:14:45.651 --> 01:14:46.990
<v Speaker 3>doses every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1391
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aspirin kills people.</v>

1392
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some thousands of people die every year.</v>

1393
01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.340
<v Speaker 3>But the actual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1394
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:55.230
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1395
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.290
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number of people that fall in their</v>

1396
01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:03.490
<v Speaker 3>bathtub and day and to foods get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>bathtubs to make them all out of rubber.</v>

1397
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.250
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1398
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.580
<v Speaker 3>my wife said about me when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1399
01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:13.790
<v Speaker 3>some of the neighborhood teenagers when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had our teenagers were thinking of</v>

1400
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.650
<v Speaker 3>coming to visit me at boom festival in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>

1401
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.040
<v Speaker 3>which is one of these festivals where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the most harm reduction.</v>

1402
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these were teenage boys.</v>

1403
01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 3>And what my wife said about me was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really good at prevention,</v>

1404
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:29.070
<v Speaker 3>but I was good at rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

1405
01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:32.590
<v Speaker 3>And so that's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prohibition versus public health,</v>

1406
01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:34.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevention,</v>

1407
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:35.750
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1408
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:38.680
<v Speaker 3>prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we can be good at acknowledging</v>

1409
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 3>the risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being prepared for them the same way</v>

1410
01:15:40.901 --> 01:15:44.050
<v Speaker 3>that festivals have medical tents and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have all sorts of physical</v>

1411
01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:46.930
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is there's not a strict</v>

1412
01:15:46.931 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 3>prohibition on dangerous things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the precedents already been set of a</v>

1413
01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That precedent of freedom.</v>

1414
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:55.540
<v Speaker 3>We would like to extend across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

1415
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.010
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we want.</v>

1416
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.680
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me that I can go to a bar</v>

1417
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:04.681
<v Speaker 3>and drink my fucking lungs out and smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes all day long and I can take</v>

1418
01:16:05.471 --> 01:16:07.510
<v Speaker 3>pain pills and I can do all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1419
01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 3>but I can't have a joint.</v>

1420
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.150
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me that.</v>

1421
01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:12.880
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the quote that was recently</v>

1422
01:16:12.881 --> 01:16:16.480
<v Speaker 3>circulated on the Internet by Erlick men</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the origins of the drug war?</v>

1423
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.400
<v Speaker 3>I did see that repeated well what</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically he said that Nixon,</v>

1424
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 3>when they were looking at the protests</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were being conducted by the hippies</v>

1425
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:28.510
<v Speaker 3>against the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>against a lot of Nixon policies and the</v>

1426
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:33.300
<v Speaker 3>blacks who are arguing for civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they knew they could not make it</v>

1427
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.740
<v Speaker 3>illegal to be black or illegal to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hippie,</v>

1428
01:16:35.741 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 3>but they could look at the drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 3>those groups were using and selectively</v>

1429
01:16:39.401 --> 01:16:43.510
<v Speaker 3>criminalized and prosecute them and use</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to break up those communities and</v>

1430
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 3>that they knew they were exaggerating</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science and that the drug war was a</v>

1431
01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 3>political war against certain kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug users who were considered to be a</v>

1432
01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:55.320
<v Speaker 3>problem to Nixon and Ehrlichman and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>was something that they will come and</v>

1433
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.520
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 20 years ago.</v>

1434
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 3>It didn't get that much attention and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been dead I think 10 years now,</v>

1435
01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:03.700
<v Speaker 3>but it just came out again in an article</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are looking at what</v>

1436
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Ehrlichman said and it seems intuitively</v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

1437
01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 3>Intuitively true in just unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 3>how damaging</v>

1438
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>and for how long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1439
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it's been going on since 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>

1440
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:17.360
<v Speaker 1>we're deep here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1441
01:17:17.361 --> 01:17:22.361
<v Speaker 1>but it also had triggered into a fear of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious of fear,</v>

1442
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just these political parts,</v>

1443
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:28.820
<v Speaker 1>but just the drugs themselves and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why they were political with</v>

1444
01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:33.710
<v Speaker 1>also the blanket label of drugs becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>really problematic because you have all</v>

1445
01:17:33.711 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>these things lumped in together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got heroin and marijuana in the</v>

1446
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 1>same categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got cocaine and all these things</v>

1447
01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>that are so different and to call them</v>
<v Speaker 1>all drugs,</v>

1448
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1449
01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1450
01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good implication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1451
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:51.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there should be obvious</v>

1452
01:17:51.741 --> 01:17:53.600
<v Speaker 1>classifications like we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>

1453
01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked me about,</v>

1454
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were telling me about the ecstasy</v>

1455
01:17:56.901 --> 01:18:00.170
<v Speaker 1>and I immediately thought amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a category and that's how we</v>

1456
01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 1>should describe them.</v>

1457
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think describing things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1458
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dumb.</v>

1460
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1461
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.940
<v Speaker 1>of course I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I stupid.</v>

1462
01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.270
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to do things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are way better than not having them.</v>

1463
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And there's plenty of drugs that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent,</v>

1464
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:16.880
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely drug free is dumb.</v>

1465
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are a drug factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't do damaging drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do terrible drugs,</v>

1467
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:26.720
<v Speaker 1>don't do meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do things that are going to fuck</v>

1468
01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:27.381
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:18:27.381 --> 01:18:28.071
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1470
01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 1>there's probably some stuff you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid just because it's not healthy for</v>

1471
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is labeling them all</v>

1472
01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the dose.</v>

1473
01:18:35.601 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one of the,</v>

1474
01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:43.060
<v Speaker 1>the FDA made their reputation in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>early sixties on blocking thalidomide to</v>

1475
01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:47.960
<v Speaker 1>be prescribed in America for morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>sickness for pregnant women because it</v>

1476
01:18:47.961 --> 01:18:49.580
<v Speaker 1>caused all these solidimide babies.</v>

1477
01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

1478
01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm skeptical woman who ended up winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president's Medal of honor,</v>

1479
01:18:57.471 --> 01:19:01.490
<v Speaker 1>the only person from the FDA for</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking this drug to linemite.</v>

1480
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:06.410
<v Speaker 1>It was the epitome of the bad drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's used in the treatment of</v>

1481
01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an approved medication.</v>

1482
01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Thalidomide is an approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let medications.</v>

1483
01:19:11.141 --> 01:19:13.920
<v Speaker 1>They just one of those medications that</v>
<v Speaker 1>only affects a certain pages,</v>

1484
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.140
<v Speaker 1>certain blood vessels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be useful in certain ways are</v>

1485
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.110
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

1486
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:22.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that there's good and bad</v>

1487
01:19:22.371 --> 01:19:24.500
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that things are good or bad in</v>

1488
01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think methamphetamine is a</v>

1489
01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:28.260
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1490
01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 1>there's mass for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do it?</v>

1491
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I've tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it like?</v>

1492
01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like tried it one time.</v>

1493
01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 1>You cleaned your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have that kind of energetic.</v>

1494
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:48.830
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that it was similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>

1496
01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a stimulant that</v>

1497
01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 1>can be really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father,</v>

1498
01:19:58.101 --> 01:20:00.410
<v Speaker 1>this was a shocking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father was a doctor,</v>

1499
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:04.610
<v Speaker 1>a pediatrician and years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's retired now,</v>

1500
01:20:04.611 --> 01:20:05.444
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1501
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.340
<v Speaker 1>well after I was into doing psychedelics</v>

1502
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 3>and it dropped out with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was what I was focusing on.</v>

1503
01:20:10.201 --> 01:20:12.530
<v Speaker 3>He shared with me that he and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1504
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:16.650
<v Speaker 3>medical friends did math because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were under these ridiculous residencies</v>

1505
01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:18.570
<v Speaker 3>and they had to work for these really</v>
<v Speaker 3>long hours.</v>

1506
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that in the fifties it was very</v>

1507
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:24.120
<v Speaker 3>common for residents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>medical doctors with all sorts of</v>

1508
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:24.610
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zoo,</v>

1509
01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:26.870
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1510
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a major tool used in the war and</v>

1511
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:34.340
<v Speaker 3>with the soldiers and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1512
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1513
01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have this evolutionary feel</v>

1514
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:42.830
<v Speaker 3>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It helps you do,</v>

1515
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.300
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a way where psychedelics</v>

1516
01:20:45.301 --> 01:20:50.040
<v Speaker 3>help you refine what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it just gives you energy.</v>

1517
01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Does it give you food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a mood to.</v>

1518
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1519
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

1520
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.200
<v Speaker 3>So mtma is methylenedioxy</v>
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine,</v>

1521
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:03.590
<v Speaker 3>so there is a similar molecular change</v>
<v Speaker 3>with other additions to it,</v>

1522
01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:06.840
<v Speaker 3>which fundamentally changed how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

1523
01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:10.800
<v Speaker 3>what it does in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a part of maybe what triggers</v>

1524
01:21:10.801 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 3>the euphoria as well as the dopamine</v>
<v Speaker 3>release.</v>

1525
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so that,</v>

1526
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 3>that chemically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the army in 1952,</v>

1527
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:22.800
<v Speaker 3>the chemical warfare and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were looking for mind control</v>

1528
01:21:22.801 --> 01:21:25.500
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they did a study with animal</v>

1529
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:28.290
<v Speaker 3>toxicity studies looking for ld</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and others with eight</v>

1530
01:21:28.291 --> 01:21:33.291
<v Speaker 3>different drugs in a range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was Mtma and one was,</v>

1531
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.630
<v Speaker 3>it was like meth amphetamine to</v>
<v Speaker 3>masculine.</v>

1532
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:43.830
<v Speaker 3>So mtma is kind of like I'm masculine in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense that it has that which is from</v>

1533
01:21:46.171 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 3>pod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has this psychedelic,</v>

1534
01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:52.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ego dissolving and</v>

1535
01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.680
<v Speaker 3>things emerging and nonverbal processing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and emotional intensity that it has that</v>

1536
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:04.860
<v Speaker 3>from masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that eco desolving it's</v>

1537
01:22:04.861 --> 01:22:09.861
<v Speaker 3>more you're calmer and that has the</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy from methamphetamine but not in a</v>

1538
01:22:10.711 --> 01:22:12.840
<v Speaker 3>jittery way because you can sit still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can meditate,</v>

1539
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:14.360
<v Speaker 3>meditators are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1540
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 3>some of them have learned from Mtma or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psilocybin to tip in a meditative</v>

1541
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:22.570
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can use these in any number of,</v>

1542
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.550
<v Speaker 3>of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you kind of have this paradoxical</v>

1543
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.680
<v Speaker 3>combination of methamphetamine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>masculine that produced the molecule.</v>

1544
01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 3>It does something different but</v>
<v Speaker 3>reminiscent.</v>

1545
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:39.650
<v Speaker 3>And it is something that I believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be used in initially highly</v>

1546
01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:46.560
<v Speaker 3>controlled therapeutic settings for</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular clinical indications.</v>

1547
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.800
<v Speaker 3>And over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by overtime,</v>

1548
01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm 10 or 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be a,</v>

1549
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:56.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a development of psychedelic clinics</v>

1550
01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:58.260
<v Speaker 3>like hospice centers.</v>

1551
01:22:58.350 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Hospice centers spread all over America</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 30 years.</v>

1552
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 3>The first one was 1974,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2004.</v>

1553
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:08.751
<v Speaker 3>There was 3,500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a place to help people who are at the</v>

1554
01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 3>end of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these are psychedelic treatment</v>

1555
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:16.670
<v Speaker 3>centers to help people do ego death or</v>
<v Speaker 3>to to tie to their old selves or to see</v>

1556
01:23:16.671 --> 01:23:21.671
<v Speaker 3>more or that these centers will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed all over America.</v>

1557
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I think over a process of once the drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>are approved and probably Mtma and</v>

1558
01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 3>silicide and we'll both be approved</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the same time.</v>

1559
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:33.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1560
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:37.090
<v Speaker 3>in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>21 is our current predictions and then</v>

1561
01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll start elaborating these clinics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people will get more and more</v>

1562
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 3>comfortable to it so that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicalization proceeds legalization and</v>

1563
01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:47.260
<v Speaker 3>that's what we've seen with medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana that the culture gets</v>

1564
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:52.261
<v Speaker 3>comfortable through this process of I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>now research and use that they can trust</v>

1565
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:59.110
<v Speaker 3>that they see directly and they see</v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution centers that aren't violent</v>

1566
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 3>and people see a system and they then</v>
<v Speaker 3>are now.</v>

1567
01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The latest poll was 60 percent of</v>

1568
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Americans in favor Americans in favor of</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana legalization.</v>

1569
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Highest it's ever been.</v>

1570
01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.170
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's,</v>

1572
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that we need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are under so much stress and if</v>

1573
01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:23.350
<v Speaker 3>you look around at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is under so much stress and</v>

1574
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 3>the environment is under stress and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures are bumping up against each</v>

1575
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:28.990
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we need to have all the tools</v>

1576
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.230
<v Speaker 3>available to manage the stress because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1577
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:38.340
<v Speaker 3>it's a tremendously crucial time in</v>
<v Speaker 3>human history where we have these</v>

1578
01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:43.810
<v Speaker 3>capabilities through our technology that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never have for impact.</v>

1579
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Planetary Systems went away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These psychedelic drugs that are kind of</v>

1580
01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 3>technology as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are technology to get us to</v>

1581
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:52.090
<v Speaker 3>understand how our brains functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1582
01:24:52.091 --> 01:24:53.110
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

1583
01:24:53.111 --> 01:24:56.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a confluence of coincidence,</v>

1584
01:24:56.531 --> 01:24:58.540
<v Speaker 3>of timing that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1585
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Albert Hoffman who invented lsd first</v>
<v Speaker 3>upgraded and 38 and then accidentally</v>

1586
01:25:03.581 --> 01:25:08.050
<v Speaker 3>ingested it in 43,</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt that the development of nuclear</v>

1587
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.440
<v Speaker 3>splitting of the atom was occurring</v>
<v Speaker 3>contemporaneously with this discovery of</v>

1588
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.053
<v Speaker 3>LSD.</v>

1589
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:18.040
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in his view,</v>

1590
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:22.690
<v Speaker 3>there was this kind of outer technology</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this inner technology.</v>

1591
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:27.130
<v Speaker 3>And that Einstein said the splitting of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the atom has changed everything except</v>

1592
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 3>our motive thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hence we drift towards unparalleled</v>

1593
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:33.400
<v Speaker 3>could astrophe what shall be required as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a substantially new mode of thinking.</v>

1594
01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:35.950
<v Speaker 3>And Albert Hoffman was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1595
01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I do wonder about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1596
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.360
<v Speaker 3>the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which many people think that if it comes</v>

1597
01:25:43.361 --> 01:25:44.890
<v Speaker 3>from nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good.</v>

1598
01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there if it's plant medicine,</v>

1599
01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.780
<v Speaker 3>but if it comes from a lab at somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspect.</v>

1600
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 3>But I think that it comes from our mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're from nature labs,</v>

1601
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:58.120
<v Speaker 3>so lsd nature of these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just extract the chemicals from</v>

1602
01:25:58.121 --> 01:25:59.740
<v Speaker 3>these plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you break it down to what the</v>

1603
01:25:59.741 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 3>chemicals are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can reproduce those in the lab.</v>

1604
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.560
<v Speaker 3>It's not as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as.</v>

1605
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not</v>

1606
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing as natural.</v>

1607
01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1608
01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Because it's all from something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>

1609
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Well actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're trying to see,</v>

1610
01:26:14.230 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we're operating in the public</v>

1611
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 1>benefit manner and fair trade and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1612
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I asked the company that's now making us</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a kilogram of.</v>

1613
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 1>We're having a new kilogram of Mtma made</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you need more.</v>

1614
01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought you said you had a gang of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have 960 grams,</v>

1615
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gmp medical.</v>

1616
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not acceptable for phase three</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

1617
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that.</v>

1618
01:26:37.101 --> 01:26:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say went bad.</v>

1619
01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.440
<v Speaker 1>We got to keep it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids.</v>

1620
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Well we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to give it away to researchers.</v>

1621
01:26:46.091 --> 01:26:47.870
<v Speaker 1>So if there are researchers that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>

1622
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 1>we have free</v>
<v Speaker 1>time researching.</v>

1623
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 1>We would search for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would like to give it there,</v>

1624
01:26:54.411 --> 01:26:56.890
<v Speaker 1>but the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly crocodile attacks.</v>

1625
01:26:56.890 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>But I'll fuck around with some ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the current.</v>

1626
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Alaina is costing us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1627
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>to have the medical grade is now costing</v>
<v Speaker 1>us $400,000.</v>

1628
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we need that.</v>

1629
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 1>We need that medical grade and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our event.</v>

1630
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:13.010
<v Speaker 1>You got to like a bucket of this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>laying around.</v>

1631
01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

1632
01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're making this</v>

1633
01:27:17.061 --> 01:27:18.000
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1634
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Into the higher regulated areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is just that the standards of</v>

1635
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.610
<v Speaker 1>procurement weren't as strict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that?</v>

1636
01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>

1637
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.190
<v Speaker 1>that the symphony may just as pure as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1638
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:31.650
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1639
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.640
<v Speaker 1>never used the word procurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those words that are used in the</v>

1640
01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:37.790
<v Speaker 1>smoothness of the right word is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay could use right there.</v>

1641
01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the pedigree of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients,</v>

1642
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:45.140
<v Speaker 1>so there has to be a paper trail for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients and so you don't have that</v>

1643
01:27:45.141 --> 01:27:45.350
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1644
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:47.930
<v Speaker 1>You've got your shift from a dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sort of.</v>

1645
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:51.530
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the paperwork.</v>

1646
01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a car.</v>

1647
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's a part of the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making mtma where you need aluminum</v>

1648
01:27:58.010 --> 01:28:03.010
<v Speaker 1>and took some aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ with Rowan forks in there</v>

1649
01:28:03.330 --> 01:28:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and he took some aluminum foil and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the process.</v>

1650
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>

1651
01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not like witchy aluminum</v>

1652
01:28:10.731 --> 01:28:13.290
<v Speaker 1>foil and which batch and where did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from?</v>

1653
01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 1>And Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy through aluminum foil into your</v>

1654
01:28:16.401 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 1>fucking mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janky ass fucking way to make things.</v>

1655
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Throw the metal in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems so stupid.</v>

1656
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was a really bad cans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

1657
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.870
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in it.</v>

1658
01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Want to roll?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're rolling.</v>

1659
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I knew more chemistry,</v>

1660
01:28:34.581 --> 01:28:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I could kind of explain what it did and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the process.</v>

1661
01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.480
<v Speaker 1>But aluminum is super calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a common rather aluminum is like a,</v>

1662
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:43.880
<v Speaker 1>we think of aluminum as being frying</v>
<v Speaker 1>pans,</v>

1663
01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the form it takes in the</v>

1664
01:28:46.341 --> 01:28:47.210
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1665
01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 1>we're car panels and make a lot of cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of aluminum now because they figured</v>

1666
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:53.930
<v Speaker 1>out how to make like super lightweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very strong aluminum.</v>

1667
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.010
<v Speaker 1>That's as strong as steel but lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But aluminum is everywhere.</v>

1668
01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It's in dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like one of the most common</v>

1669
01:29:00.651 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 1>metals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they use this stuff.</v>

1670
01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:06.810
<v Speaker 1>How much do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in say a tiny amount?</v>

1671
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was all that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

1672
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.570
<v Speaker 1>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1673
01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a chemist so I can't really say.</v>

1674
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you found other shit you were</v>

1675
01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:18.570
<v Speaker 1>taking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

1676
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a peer Mtma great dude.</v>

1677
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I would've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the fuck up.</v>

1678
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying you threw a fork in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to sit down and you gotta tell me</v>

1679
01:29:27.841 --> 01:29:29.340
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

1680
01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to have aluminum foil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the FDA and we said,</v>

1681
01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>is there some way we can take this Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just as pure as what we're</v>

1682
01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Speaker 1>going to get and turn it into medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade,</v>

1683
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.900
<v Speaker 1>and they said there's no way you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do that because you have to.</v>

1684
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:46.320
<v Speaker 1>This is now preparing for prescription</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mtma,</v>

1685
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.370
<v Speaker 1>so I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1686
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.170
<v Speaker 1>so I have to take it from every initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredient has to be verified at the</v>

1687
01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 1>source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weighed out,</v>

1688
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:55.740
<v Speaker 1>documented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you make it and then it's</v>

1689
01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:57.150
<v Speaker 1>medical grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1690
01:29:57.170 --> 01:29:59.230
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More or less so.</v>

1691
01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Of this 400,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're about $75,000 is just to validate</v>

1692
01:30:04.291 --> 01:30:09.291
<v Speaker 1>all the methods that are being used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another 54,000 is three years.</v>

1693
01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Stability Studies to show that the MTMA</v>
<v Speaker 1>can last three years.</v>

1694
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Even though we have mtma from 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still using this that we have</v>

1695
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.830
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purity studies on throughout the years,</v>

1696
01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:24.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's about this particular batch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually our 30th anniversary</v>

1697
01:30:24.871 --> 01:30:29.310
<v Speaker 1>celebration on April 17th in Oakland at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Scottish rite center.</v>

1698
01:30:29.311 --> 01:30:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just a plug for a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a plug for a party.</v>

1699
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:36.830
<v Speaker 1>There you just snuck that in is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising money to illegal drug deal to</v>

1700
01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:38.910
<v Speaker 1>buy this Mtma.</v>

1701
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:41.450
<v Speaker 1>How do people find out about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't get there.</v>

1702
01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Go to the maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that org website and there's information</v>

1703
01:30:45.811 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 1>right on the homepage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerful.</v>

1704
01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's about helping people though</v>

1705
01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.430
<v Speaker 1>also think about having dinners in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own homes with their friends.</v>

1706
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.970
<v Speaker 1>So are you going to make a holiday dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1707
01:30:56.971 --> 01:30:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus has a fucking holiday and he's</v>

1708
01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>widely believed to be a piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1709
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1710
01:31:04.411 --> 01:31:05.250
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1711
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say Lummis is supposed to be</v>

1712
01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:08.310
<v Speaker 1>a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1713
01:31:08.311 --> 01:31:08.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1714
01:31:08.611 --> 01:31:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that once we get empty medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine and then it becomes legal and</v>

1715
01:31:12.241 --> 01:31:14.460
<v Speaker 1>then those people are doing it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

1716
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:17.010
<v Speaker 1>then we can turn Columbus Day into mdm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1717
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming.</v>

1718
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus did start something in motion,</v>

1719
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:25.120
<v Speaker 1>but Columbus as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you google them board,</v>

1720
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.700
<v Speaker 1>it was a terrible human being.</v>

1721
01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.490
<v Speaker 1>He was a good role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an account of one of the</v>

1722
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>missionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that was there on the island.</v>

1723
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a Catholic missionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what religion,</v>

1724
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one religious person,</v>

1725
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote this account of what Columbus and</v>

1726
01:31:43.741 --> 01:31:48.741
<v Speaker 1>his soldiers that did do some native</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and it was just horrific and you</v>

1727
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:52.920
<v Speaker 1>realize these were the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was worried about,</v>

1728
01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:56.100
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about a boat shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and some monsters get off that boat</v>

1729
01:31:56.490 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and these were the people and what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had done to these for gold.</v>

1730
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.720
<v Speaker 3>They found out at some of them had gold</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just,</v>

1731
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:07.030
<v Speaker 3>they just did a horrific shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very similar to what like,</v>

1732
01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:09.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened on this coast here.</v>

1733
01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm with the INCAS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:13.960
<v Speaker 3>the aztecs rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:17.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a story of Cabeza de Vaca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that story?</v>

1736
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Which stories?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alvara Nunez.</v>

1737
01:32:19.190 --> 01:32:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Cabeza de Vaca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the story,</v>

1738
01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.610
<v Speaker 3>a true story of people that found real</v>
<v Speaker 3>gold,</v>

1739
01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.010
<v Speaker 3>a Spanish conquistadores this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1740
01:32:27.011 --> 01:32:29.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been made into a movie.</v>

1741
01:32:29.351 --> 01:32:31.480
<v Speaker 3>It should be made into a more major</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

1742
01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.600
<v Speaker 3>What's that movie called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1743
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>children of the sun children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the son Jimmy.</v>

1744
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:38.283
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1745
01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I think the movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be called.</v>

1746
01:32:41.411 --> 01:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just make up your own names.</v>

1747
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I like star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

1748
01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big foot and his buddy in space.</v>

1749
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story that out.</v>

1750
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I've written that actually this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is incredible.</v>

1751
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:58.360
<v Speaker 3>This is the hidden history of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first medium children of the</v>

1752
01:32:58.361 --> 01:33:03.361
<v Speaker 3>sun is the script I've written actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing man.</v>

1753
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 3>You smoked too much pot before the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be honest with us a little bit.</v>

1754
01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.190
<v Speaker 3>That's a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

1755
01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a fault of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did a little bit right?</v>

1756
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.470
<v Speaker 3>It's good for creative brainstorming</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1758
01:33:14.471 --> 01:33:17.170
<v Speaker 3>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the movie the story.</v>

1759
01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.910
<v Speaker 3>We'll just move you that you can watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1760
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be Cabeza de Vaca.</v>

1761
01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a dwarf Sharman that doesn't</v>

1762
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.820
<v Speaker 3>really exist in the real story and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this has to be to hold true</v>

1763
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 3>because it's the hope of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the hope.</v>

1764
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:38.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a story of a several hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>conquistadores around 15,</v>

1765
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:43.441
<v Speaker 3>28 trying to link up with Cortez blown</v>
<v Speaker 3>off course in a hurricane land in around</v>

1766
01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Tampa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>

1767
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:47.990
<v Speaker 3>and have this bunch of hundreds of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>conquistadores.</v>

1768
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Only four of them survive and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>

1769
01:33:52.271 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 3>one of them is black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them is a more a slave.</v>

1770
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 3>The rest are white and they become</v>
<v Speaker 3>slave.</v>

1771
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:02.860
<v Speaker 3>So they start out at the head of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>empire exploring and plundering,</v>

1772
01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 3>and then they get destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become slaves.</v>

1773
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 3>So they get captured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get captured.</v>

1774
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Native Americans that lived in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.310
<v Speaker 3>So the native Americans that lived in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>

1776
01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.780
<v Speaker 3>the seminole tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1777
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Is that them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure which.</v>

1778
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:15.541
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1779
01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:19.450
<v Speaker 3>they ended up running away and it takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight years.</v>

1780
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.400
<v Speaker 3>This whole process that they go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1781
01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 3>This is the charting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the first meeting of the</v>

1782
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:27.070
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white and red races in much of North</v>

1783
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.760
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1784
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.050
<v Speaker 3>And at one point when they're slaves to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get some use from them,</v>

1785
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:34.570
<v Speaker 3>the Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the native Americans say they want them</v>

1786
01:34:34.571 --> 01:34:35.860
<v Speaker 3>to do some healings.</v>

1787
01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:38.260
<v Speaker 3>They think they're special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there is a black person,</v>

1788
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.220
<v Speaker 3>they came and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not healers,</v>

1789
01:34:42.221 --> 01:34:43.240
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1790
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 3>and they say if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to not feed you.</v>

1791
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 3>And they try to do a healing and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually works.</v>

1792
01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:55.900
<v Speaker 3>The person says they're better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what exists is,</v>

1793
01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1794
01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>the document,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of historical documents,</v>

1795
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:04.280
<v Speaker 3>but the point was the ailment that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>documented adapt to,</v>

1796
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:06.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was they do talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1797
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you wrote a script on it.</v>

1798
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact first.</v>

1799
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:14.210
<v Speaker 3>This was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided that at some point I couldn't</v>

1800
01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 3>try to make the movie happen and also</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make Mtma happen</v>

1801
01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:21.160
<v Speaker 3>aside for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the,</v>

1802
01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:23.060
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the symbol I have set aside,</v>

1803
01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:24.470
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't even thought about for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

1804
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 3>But I think that the story is important</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to hear it.</v>

1805
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Alvara Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cabeza de Vaca,</v>

1806
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.870
<v Speaker 3>they became healers and they went</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually.</v>

1807
01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.910
<v Speaker 3>All they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People gave them all their stuff.</v>

1808
01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:38.210
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want it to go to where the,</v>

1809
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they thought what Cortez was,</v>

1810
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.541
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>

1811
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:44.430
<v Speaker 3>How did they become healers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because they heal this one guy that</v>

1812
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:45.830
<v Speaker 3>they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1813
01:35:45.831 --> 01:35:48.440
<v Speaker 3>this is our new job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed obviously I didn't know I was</v>

1814
01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:50.480
<v Speaker 3>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1815
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:51.333
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1816
01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:55.460
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were pressed into service as</v>

1817
01:35:55.461 --> 01:35:59.630
<v Speaker 3>healers and some of them they felt were</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly more talented than others</v>

1818
01:35:59.631 --> 01:36:04.631
<v Speaker 3>at it and they ended up with basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the whole groups of Indians that</v>

1819
01:36:06.701 --> 01:36:08.600
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one tribe would take them to the next</v>

1820
01:36:08.601 --> 01:36:10.580
<v Speaker 3>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had the allegiance of all of these</v>

1821
01:36:10.581 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Indians and they learned to live very</v>
<v Speaker 3>humbly.</v>

1822
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:16.580
<v Speaker 3>They didn't take stuff for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were incredibly good survivors</v>

1823
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:21.970
<v Speaker 3>through amazing hardships and they saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>their humanity with the Indians and they</v>

1824
01:36:21.981 --> 01:36:24.620
<v Speaker 3>had sort of conquered through love</v>
<v Speaker 3>through these healings.</v>

1825
01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:28.150
<v Speaker 3>And then they ended up getting to where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the west was to,</v>

1826
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.400
<v Speaker 3>to where Cortez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're the key stores where they</v>

1827
01:36:31.401 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 3>finally saw burned out villages and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people as slaves and they were taken,</v>

1828
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:38.370
<v Speaker 3>captured themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Alberto Nunez,</v>

1829
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Cabeza de Vaca went and was taken as</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoner back and he had to write this</v>

1830
01:36:43.101 --> 01:36:48.101
<v Speaker 3>report to the king about what happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the expedition and the black men,</v>

1831
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Esteban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nico,</v>

1832
01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.420
<v Speaker 3>he stayed and he traveled up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>explored a lot of California and ended</v>

1833
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:58.421
<v Speaker 3>up being killed by the natives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the story Henry Miller wrote a</v>

1834
01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:03.030
<v Speaker 3>tremendous introduction to this story</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the salvation of,</v>

1835
01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the westward expansion,</v>

1836
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:09.890
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it showed is that through this</v>

1837
01:37:09.891 --> 01:37:12.710
<v Speaker 3>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through whatever circumstances they got,</v>

1838
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:15.590
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through cooperation and nonviolence,</v>

1839
01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:17.450
<v Speaker 3>they had the support they had.</v>

1840
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.190
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1841
01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 3>the four that they didn't kill the four</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>

1842
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:23.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>96 that they killed.</v>

1843
01:37:23.751 --> 01:37:25.470
<v Speaker 3>They didn't get the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1844
01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:29.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took them is not in violence thing.</v>

1845
01:37:29.271 --> 01:37:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Only worked out when it got done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like four people.</v>

1846
01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.200
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's 96 percent</v>

1847
01:37:36.201 --> 01:37:40.010
<v Speaker 3>ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking terrible idea.</v>

1848
01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Violence work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These four guys live to become fucking</v>

1849
01:37:43.581 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 3>wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carnival healers.</v>

1850
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.710

<v Speaker 3>this report.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he recommended a book on</v>

1853
01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:55.980

<v Speaker 3>Ken Burns did something on him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's also a lot of people have sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of looked at this story and taken a lot</v>

1870
01:38:43.261 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 3>of hope from it that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it took a lot of death for</v>

1871
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:49.760
<v Speaker 3>these people to get to this attitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1872
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:51.590
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Indians were,</v>

1873
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:54.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping slaves and killing each other,</v>

1874
01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:57.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were able to,</v>

1875
01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.240
<v Speaker 3>a different kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got off the boat as those,</v>

1877
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rampaging people,</v>

1878
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:08.920
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they transformed into um,</v>

1879
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.590
<v Speaker 3>humanists and humble and actually Cabeza</v>
<v Speaker 3>de Vaca was able to go on a second</v>

1880
01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 3>expedition to South America.</v>

1881
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 3>He was able to talk his way into it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it.</v>

1882
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:22.710
<v Speaker 3>He explored more areas than other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>did without killing any Indians.</v>

1883
01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:25.560
<v Speaker 3>And he discovered the request,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who falls where the movie,</v>

1884
01:39:25.561 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 3>the mission was made big waterfalls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he,</v>

1885
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:34.510
<v Speaker 3>he started demonstrated that he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good ambassador between cultures and</v>

1886
01:39:34.711 --> 01:39:37.680
<v Speaker 3>tried to still,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but do it in a way of,</v>

1889
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:44.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more collaboration.</v>

1890
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting to think of</v>

1891
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:52.190
<v Speaker 3>cultures colliding like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some crazy people from Spain getting in</v>

1892
01:39:52.191 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 3>a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting washed out of their course and</v>

<v Speaker 3>attacking people being at war.</v>

1896
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:05.850
<v Speaker 3>And then four dudes make it through that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and live.</v>

1897
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how cool those guys must have</v>

<v Speaker 3>first world,</v>

1935
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:53.110
<v Speaker 3>first nations people that these w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cultural bumping into each other</v>

1936
01:41:53.111 --> 01:41:56.140
<v Speaker 3>all over now more ever than before in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of the world.</v>

1937
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's that cultural appropriation or.</v>

1938
01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's appropriation.</v>

1939
01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:02.710
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1940
01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you steal,</v>

1941
01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:07.890
<v Speaker 3>you can tend to be a native American and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold your own pod ceremonies,</v>

1942
01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.780
<v Speaker 3>the that and on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and red paint.</v>

1943
01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flattery,</v>

1944
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:16.120
<v Speaker 3>imitation is the most sincere form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>flattery.</v>

1945
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:20.080
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's like you want people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopt if you think it's good,</v>

1946
01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:23.590
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have to adapt your dogma</v>
<v Speaker 3>or your rituals.</v>

1947
01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that with our mdms,</v>

1948
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 3>we have our method and we have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is videotaped.</v>

1949
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:32.170
<v Speaker 3>We even have it scored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have raiders that look at the</v>

1950
01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:35.860
<v Speaker 3>therapist and score them on how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're implying that we're hearing with</v>

1951
01:42:35.861 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 3>our method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we want other people with other</v>

1952
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:42.460
<v Speaker 3>methods to use it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how it works in other contexts.</v>

1953
01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 4>Native Americans have their own rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1954
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:48.160
<v Speaker 4>When they have in their territories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can.</v>

1955
01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:53.140
<v Speaker 4>That's why they can put casinos up in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there as do they have rules as far as</v>

1956
01:42:53.141 --> 01:42:55.540
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have their own rules.</v>

1957
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have because on tribal lands,</v>

1958
01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:03.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well first off they have authority and</v>

1959
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.260
<v Speaker 3>tribal lands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people work in the military</v>

1960
01:43:05.261 --> 01:43:08.710
<v Speaker 3>or do stuff with the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they have the religious freedom to</v>

1961
01:43:08.711 --> 01:43:11.560
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The native American church is the US</v>

1962
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Supreme Court upheld and a congress that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

1963
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 3>but the federal government actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to limit it so that if you had to</v>

1964
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:23.290
<v Speaker 3>have 25 percent Indian blood to be part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the native American church in order</v>

1965
01:43:23.291 --> 01:43:27.430
<v Speaker 3>to participate in the pod rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the states don't have that kind of</v>

1966
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 3>racial requirement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to try to prevent the spread of this</v>

1967
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:36.601
<v Speaker 3>religion from the native Americans to</v>
<v Speaker 3>wider groups of hippies and others that</v>

1968
01:43:36.641 --> 01:43:38.380
<v Speaker 3>like pod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1969
01:43:38.381 --> 01:43:40.690
<v Speaker 3>they tried to make a racial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The federal government does have this</v>

1970
01:43:40.691 --> 01:43:43.330
<v Speaker 3>racial limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's largely ignored and it's</v>

1971
01:43:43.331 --> 01:43:44.530
<v Speaker 3>ignored by the states.</v>

1972
01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.470
<v Speaker 4>That's why white dudes were trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rastafarians.</v>

1973
01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where white dirty,</v>

1974
01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 4>stinky people with dreadlocks came from.</v>

1975
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.400
<v Speaker 3>That's how it was reignited</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're all fans of Bob Marley.</v>

1976
01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they.</v>

1977
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I knew a dude who was a pot dealer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he claimed Rastafari and he said,</v>

1978
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:07.220
<v Speaker 3>this is part of my religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1979
01:44:07.221 --> 01:44:08.620
<v Speaker 3>It was like real serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1980
01:44:08.690 --> 01:44:11.570
<v Speaker 3>In those cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've lost in court or they have,</v>

1981
01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:13.180
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't lose the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1982
01:44:13.181 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Assented to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May,</v>

1983
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:17.750
<v Speaker 3>what is the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said the son to die mate went up to</v>

1984
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 3>the ninth circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't go to the Supreme Court,</v>

1985
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when y'all do vegetal,</v>

1986
01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I just came from Santa Fe this morning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where the lead church,</v>

1987
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:30.730
<v Speaker 3>the y'all hall was located in Santa Fe</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was Jeffrey Bronfman from the</v>

1988
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Canadian Jewish Bronfman family from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seagram's fortune,</v>

1989
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 3>from smuggling alcohol during</v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibition,</v>

1990
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:41.120
<v Speaker 3>and then building this massive business</v>
<v Speaker 3>as one of the grandkids.</v>

1991
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:45.500
<v Speaker 3>He ended up becoming appreciative of</v>
<v Speaker 3>IOWASCA.</v>

1992
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:50.950
<v Speaker 3>And so he hired the best lawyers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked on this case that they won a</v>

1993
01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:56.720
<v Speaker 3>unanimous supreme court case affirming</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vegetal,</v>

1994
01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.070
<v Speaker 3>the Union of the plants.</v>

1995
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:59.300
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's two different plants,</v>

1996
01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:04.240
<v Speaker 3>roots and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vines and leaves and um,</v>

1997
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.360
<v Speaker 3>you put it together so to the union hall</v>
<v Speaker 3>were um,</v>

1998
01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 3>and they have legal protection in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

1999
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:15.920
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2000
01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a church.</v>

2001
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to it and I was hearing I,</v>

2002
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to it twice and the second time</v>

2003
01:45:27.141 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the myth of our church,</v>

2004
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:33.380
<v Speaker 3>the myth of the or the origin myth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of it was that King Solomon</v>

2005
01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:38.840
<v Speaker 3>went to the Amazon and told them how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>put these plants together.</v>

2006
01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2007
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.713
<v Speaker 3>King Solomon.</v>

2008
01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.140
<v Speaker 3>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2009
01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:47.120
<v Speaker 3>it is a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2010
01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.190
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2011
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:51.770
<v Speaker 3>well that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why the Supreme Court agreed with</v>

2012
01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 3>it because it's so wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2013
01:45:53.841 --> 01:45:55.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys sound like a religion,</v>

2014
01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2015
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:59.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they know that they didn't make it</v>

2016
01:45:59.751 --> 01:46:00.840
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will ask,</v>

2017
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:03.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having an incredible effect in America.</v>

2018
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:07.130
<v Speaker 3>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number of different people that are</v>

2019
01:46:07.131 --> 01:46:10.130
<v Speaker 3>using it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily in these exact religious</v>

2020
01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:13.610
<v Speaker 3>context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in kind of shamanistic or personal</v>

2021
01:46:13.611 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 3>growth or more or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or kind of little modified or,</v>

2022
01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:20.570
<v Speaker 3>or even in these services.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why hasn't that religion expanded?</v>

2023
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:21.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2024
01:46:21.951 --> 01:46:22.784
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2025
01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 3>it's being used quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of ceremonies in</v>

2026
01:46:26.211 --> 01:46:27.500
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over America,</v>

2027
01:46:27.501 --> 01:46:29.920
<v Speaker 3>all over the world with Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2028
01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.960
<v Speaker 3>but this union to vegetal udv that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they have,</v>

2029
01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.480
<v Speaker 3>they're expanding somewhat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>

2030
01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:39.760
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they have authority?</v>

2031
01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:42.860
<v Speaker 3>They have authority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have legal authority from the US</v>

2032
01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Supreme Court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the only ones,</v>

2033
01:46:44.210 --> 01:46:46.190
<v Speaker 3>the Santa diamond went up to the ninth</v>
<v Speaker 3>circuit.</v>

2034
01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:48.950
<v Speaker 3>So they essentially have the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that the,</v>

2035
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>it just didn't get appealed</v>

2036
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.560
<v Speaker 1>to the Supreme Court by the prosecutor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the new united,</v>

2037
01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:56.660
<v Speaker 1>the vegetal I didn't say you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when the owl hoo and yell,</v>

2038
01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:59.940
<v Speaker 1>when do vegetal they do have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're locked down.</v>

2039
01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:01.170
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2040
01:47:01.171 --> 01:47:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And sends a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is too.</v>

2041
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want in the appeals court and</v>

2042
01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:09.080
<v Speaker 1>when you got to get Richard Branson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get Richard Branson evolved</v>

2043
01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and start opening these bitches up like</v>
<v Speaker 1>right next to virgin records,</v>

2044
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:16.230
<v Speaker 1>leverage records anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't they expanded more?</v>

2045
01:47:16.231 --> 01:47:17.540
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2046
01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:18.580
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2047
01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:21.150
<v Speaker 1>cultural integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cultural appropriation,</v>

2048
01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 1>but cultural integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're bringing a tradition from a</v>

2049
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 1>different culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2050
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:30.660
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to integrate it at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate where it doesn't,</v>

2051
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constitutionally protected,</v>

2052
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't grow too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a way where it could grow</v>

2053
01:47:37.681 --> 01:47:42.030
<v Speaker 1>too fast and there wouldn't be the care</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the use of the tea and they want to</v>

2054
01:47:42.031 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 1>make sure that it's responsibly handled.</v>

2055
01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:46.410
<v Speaker 1>These are the people that are running</v>
<v Speaker 1>your church.</v>

2056
01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2057
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:48.750
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2058
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Brockman and they're just too</v>
<v Speaker 1>busy getting high.</v>

2059
01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:52.470
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep it on the DL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2060
01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:53.353
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2061
01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:54.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2062
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 1>They out and lay on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2063
01:47:57.330 --> 01:47:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hide by going to the Supreme</v>

2064
01:47:59.550 --> 01:48:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

2065
01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's amazing that they did</v>

2066
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:05.430
<v Speaker 1>actually get the ruling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2067
01:48:05.431 --> 01:48:09.120
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing that they're taking one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most potent psychedelic drugs</v>

2068
01:48:09.121 --> 01:48:11.760
<v Speaker 1>known to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true and.</v>

2069
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:15.240
<v Speaker 1>But they got the support of mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions because there's a lot of weird</v>

2070
01:48:15.241 --> 01:48:19.350
<v Speaker 1>things that mainstream religions do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural practices or even hasn't a</v>

2071
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:21.330
<v Speaker 1>precedent been set with wine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2072
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's most certainly a drug and it can be</v>

2073
01:48:24.751 --> 01:48:29.751
<v Speaker 1>used by children in certain ritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremonies and it can,</v>

2074
01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's a common part of Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wind is a,</v>

2075
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:35.310
<v Speaker 1>is a very common part.</v>

2076
01:48:36.150 --> 01:48:40.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird stuff in religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you start saying that one</v>

2077
01:48:40.081 --> 01:48:41.780
<v Speaker 1>person can't do their weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird stuff,</v>

2078
01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:42.500
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2079
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.580
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of weird stuff do you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>exemptions for?</v>

2080
01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And you look at their exemptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2081
01:48:46.291 --> 01:48:47.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2082
01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.650
<v Speaker 1>You can cut baby Dick's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

2083
01:48:49.651 --> 01:48:51.750
<v Speaker 1>You're rubbing dirt on your forehead on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday.</v>

2084
01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Will you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing in the idea</v>

2085
01:48:55.561 --> 01:48:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that one could make fun of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>assist at a certain point in time.</v>

2086
01:48:58.651 --> 01:49:00.690
<v Speaker 1>So you guys have blinders on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2087
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:04.590
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing is pretty wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Union Union vegetable,</v>

2088
01:49:04.591 --> 01:49:07.170
<v Speaker 1>they might have the right idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be the only way to do it.</v>

2089
01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part about that that's really good</v>

2090
01:49:09.991 --> 01:49:13.770
<v Speaker 1>is that while they have their dog man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their their traditions,</v>

2091
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it's about the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the individual experience for</v>

2092
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:17.790
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

2093
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Rick strassman did it with them and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me it was very strange.</v>

2094
01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:26.190
<v Speaker 1>He said it's really strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strong IOWASCA,</v>

2095
01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>and they sing songs about Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Daddy,</v>

2096
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:32.590
<v Speaker 1>what that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:34.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd have to have a generous</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit in a way like,</v>

2099
01:49:39.271 --> 01:49:40.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jesus,</v>

2100
01:49:40.231 --> 01:49:45.231
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's about reverence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of generalize and you're</v>

2101
01:49:47.010 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell me if this makes any sense to</v>

2102
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have this idea when you go like</v>

2103
01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:55.990
<v Speaker 1>when you take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done Iowasca,</v>

2104
01:49:55.991 --> 01:49:59.230
<v Speaker 1>but I've done dmt on multiple occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2105
01:49:59.231 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 1>So I've had this psychedelic effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most potent version of that.</v>

2106
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would wonder if you went in with the</v>

2107
01:50:07.391 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 1>intention and had these experiences with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intention to communicate with some</v>

2108
01:50:11.591 --> 01:50:16.591
<v Speaker 1>benevolent deity that you believe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for all life and all love on</v>

2109
01:50:17.471 --> 01:50:18.304
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

2110
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:23.310
<v Speaker 1>If you kept thinking of that as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>entered into this dimethyltryptamine</v>

2111
01:50:24.521 --> 01:50:29.260
<v Speaker 1>state of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it possible that a vast majority</v>

2112
01:50:29.261 --> 01:50:34.261
<v Speaker 1>of what is happening when you are having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychedelic trip is the word</v>

2113
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:36.850
<v Speaker 1>hallucination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange because with the</v>

2114
01:50:36.851 --> 01:50:41.260
<v Speaker 1>hallucination implies is in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're sitting right here with tables</v>

2115
01:50:41.261 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 1>and chairs and rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something could.</v>

2116
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.090
<v Speaker 1>You could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could not be real.</v>

2117
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:51.750
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is like what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seeing and why can't other people?</v>

2118
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Can other people see it too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2119
01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 1>if other people could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not a hallucination.</v>

2120
01:50:55.031 --> 01:50:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's how do you know what other</v>

2121
01:50:57.221 --> 01:50:59.170
<v Speaker 1>people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really don't right now.</v>

2122
01:50:59.171 --> 01:51:00.820
<v Speaker 1>How do you know when you close your</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

2123
01:51:00.821 --> 01:51:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you're on a psychedelic drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of what you're experiencing is</v>

2124
01:51:04.811 --> 01:51:09.100
<v Speaker 1>your visual cortex interacting with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

2125
01:51:09.101 --> 01:51:13.330
<v Speaker 1>interacting with these drugs and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>your creativity and your consciousness</v>

2126
01:51:13.730 --> 01:51:18.730
<v Speaker 1>are colliding and gliding and dancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>together along with your imagination and</v>

2127
01:51:19.721 --> 01:51:22.480
<v Speaker 1>in the hold on a second and in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

2128
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:27.510
<v Speaker 1>if you go into that with his intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination can conjure up this</v>

2129
01:51:27.821 --> 01:51:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Jesus type character in the IOWASCA</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremony and he can be real and he can</v>

2130
01:51:32.831 --> 01:51:36.910
<v Speaker 1>be what you want him to be and he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a manifestation of your own</v>

2131
01:51:36.911 --> 01:51:41.710
<v Speaker 1>experiences in this life that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>carried around as memories and carried</v>

2132
01:51:41.711 --> 01:51:44.350
<v Speaker 1>around as emotions and that in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic state.</v>

2133
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 1>If you continually go to it with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention,</v>

2134
01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:50.260
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience something like that.</v>

2135
01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you,</v>

2136
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:58.290
<v Speaker 1>we see through our own filters and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see a lot of times what we want to see</v>

2137
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:03.361
<v Speaker 1>and that we can coalesce a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings and images that are pre verbal</v>

2138
01:52:04.961 --> 01:52:07.110
<v Speaker 1>into certain kinds of symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2139
01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're on it and insanely</v>
<v Speaker 1>potent psychedelic drug.</v>

2140
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea that we ever know the</v>

2141
01:52:13.631 --> 01:52:18.631
<v Speaker 1>ultimate truth that it's not somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other filter through our preconceptions.</v>

2142
01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm John Lilly wrote this great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he did,</v>

2143
01:52:23.621 --> 01:52:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called simulations of God and</v>

2144
01:52:26.431 --> 01:52:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like different conceptions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have of God and how you get to</v>

2145
01:52:30.071 --> 01:52:33.370
<v Speaker 1>these views and then there's a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend that and see something even</v>

2146
01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:38.260
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have these filters and so the</v>

2147
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:40.990
<v Speaker 1>culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the context is more important than</v>

2148
01:52:40.991 --> 01:52:43.180
<v Speaker 1>the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think one of the issues of the</v>

2149
01:52:43.181 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 1>sixties was people had so much faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they</v>

2150
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.320
<v Speaker 3>wanted so much cultural change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were so.</v>

2151
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:51.800
<v Speaker 3>It was such a strife filled time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had this hope,</v>

2152
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:53.720
<v Speaker 3>this unreasonable hope that the drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>were enough.</v>

2153
01:52:53.721 --> 01:52:57.140
<v Speaker 3>That the psychedelics were enough that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would somehow or other bring this</v>

2154
01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:02.560
<v Speaker 3>connection to the truth to to this new</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding just by themselves and</v>

2155
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:09.040
<v Speaker 3>it's really more about the context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the context and with a proper open</v>

2156
01:53:09.531 --> 01:53:14.531
<v Speaker 3>context and in our case a therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 3>context in the experimental sense.</v>

2157
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Then when you add the pharmacology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it produces really unusual opportunities</v>

2158
01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:27.460
<v Speaker 3>to go very deep and that's what I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can show that we can do that and</v>

2159
01:53:29.091 --> 01:53:34.091
<v Speaker 3>contain it in a regulatory therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 3>healing context that can slowly be</v>

2160
01:53:34.611 --> 01:53:39.611
<v Speaker 3>accepted by a our culture and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really the of the value</v>

2161
01:53:43.161 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 3>proposition that we're presenting to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA.</v>

2162
01:53:45.690 --> 01:53:47.810
<v Speaker 3>The way you described it as why maps are</v>
<v Speaker 3>so important,</v>

2163
01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:50.810
<v Speaker 3>because I'm talking about making Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 3>exists when you're tripping balls,</v>

2164
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:51.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm making your own.</v>

2165
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Jesus like while you're tripping and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it back to studies and science and</v>

2166
01:53:56.361 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 3>data and presented the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing a tie.</v>

2167
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for us,</v>

2168
01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2169
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:07.310
<v Speaker 3>We're actually discussing should I wear</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tie at the 30th better or or not,</v>

2170
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.920
<v Speaker 3>but what are you going to do a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't decided yet.</v>

2171
01:54:09.921 --> 01:54:11.950
<v Speaker 3>I just dress like Jimi Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2172
01:54:11.951 --> 01:54:16.610
<v Speaker 3>but the date that the data is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2173
01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm double checking of what we think is</v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

2174
01:54:20.850 --> 01:54:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a way where we have to have</v>

2175
01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:27.960
<v Speaker 3>that humility that we don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>know this ultimate truth,</v>

2176
01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:30.320
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not just humility,</v>

2177
01:54:30.321 --> 01:54:32.570
<v Speaker 3>that's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to know what you're</v>

2178
01:54:32.571 --> 01:54:34.910
<v Speaker 3>experiencing with anybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing when they're tripping.</v>

2179
01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:36.950
<v Speaker 3>You really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what it is.</v>

2180
01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's entirely possible that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that we don't understand yet.</v>

2181
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:41.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2182
01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.440
<v Speaker 3>so the reason I brought it back in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the science is that we're</v>

2183
01:54:45.441 --> 01:54:50.441
<v Speaker 3>operationalizing its effect on symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whether you have this memory that is</v>

2184
01:54:51.711 --> 01:54:54.590
<v Speaker 3>actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whether it's Jesus or whether you're</v>

2185
01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:58.250
<v Speaker 3>remembering childhood sexual abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether that.</v>

2186
01:54:58.280 --> 01:54:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't like how you tied the two of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those together.</v>

2187
01:54:59.870 --> 01:55:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I was right about the Catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a little stop.</v>

2188
01:55:05.231 --> 01:55:06.940
<v Speaker 3>A few things I leaped over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2189
01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:12.770
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whether that occurred in actuality</v>

2190
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 3>is an important question for the legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>system more for other ways,</v>

2191
01:55:17.061 --> 01:55:19.010
<v Speaker 3>but from a therapeutic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from healing,</v>

2192
01:55:19.011 --> 01:55:22.520
<v Speaker 3>from a compassionate point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this expression,</v>

2193
01:55:22.521 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 3>if it's symbolic or actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it has the consequence of helping</v>

2194
01:55:26.811 --> 01:55:31.400
<v Speaker 3>people come to terms with themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get more acceptance about what</v>

2195
01:55:31.401 --> 01:55:33.680
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're looking at.</v>

2196
01:55:33.681 --> 01:55:36.950
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at the outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that that's the practical</v>

2197
01:55:36.951 --> 01:55:37.220
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

2198
01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the science part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there are questions.</v>

2199
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2200
01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I believe I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2201
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of times in my early lsd</v>
<v Speaker 3>trips,</v>

2202
01:55:44.311 --> 01:55:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I wanted God to show up and I wanted the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

2203
01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:49.900
<v Speaker 3>How arrogant is not busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God doesn't have a lot of other shit</v>

2205
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:54.990
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember from my bar where I was like,</v>

2206
01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:56.740
<v Speaker 3>the very next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barb Mitzvah,</v>

2207
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2208
01:55:57.930 --> 01:55:59.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I studied all this Hebrew,</v>

2209
01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:03.630
<v Speaker 3>so in my bed the next day after my</v>
<v Speaker 3>birthday.</v>

2210
01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:05.610
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the same.</v>

2211
01:56:05.611 --> 01:56:06.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not a man.</v>

2212
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:09.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not any different than there was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2213
01:56:09.451 --> 01:56:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2214
01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:10.933
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2215
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.770
<v Speaker 3>took me a couple of days where I thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>God was maybe busy,</v>

2216
01:56:13.771 --> 01:56:17.820
<v Speaker 3>maybe a lot of people got bar Mitzvah'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>that day and after like a week I</v>

2217
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:18.680
<v Speaker 3>recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2218
01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:21.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to change and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take something else.</v>

2219
01:56:21.901 --> 01:56:24.720
<v Speaker 3>The ritual didn't quite do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then even with my lsd trips,</v>

2220
01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:30.410
<v Speaker 3>wanting to see God wanting to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>clarity and not quite getting it,</v>

2221
01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:33.810
<v Speaker 3>and then appreciating that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was a delusion in some ways</v>

2222
01:56:33.811 --> 01:56:38.010
<v Speaker 3>that keeping the uncertainty is keeping</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity.</v>

2223
01:56:38.011 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2224
01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.920
<v Speaker 3>but there's that strong longing for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>for certainty.</v>

2225
01:56:44.650 --> 01:56:47.280
<v Speaker 4>You're sounding like a dude who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalizing that he didn't get to meet</v>

2226
01:56:47.281 --> 01:56:48.114
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's upset.</v>

2227
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:50.490
<v Speaker 4>God didn't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing will be different,</v>

2228
01:56:50.491 --> 01:56:53.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's like aliens and visit</v>

2229
01:56:53.461 --> 01:56:57.330
<v Speaker 4>everybody when he does visit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very unique experience and it's</v>

2230
01:56:57.331 --> 01:56:59.270
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2231
01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.830
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's real problem in saying,</v>

2232
01:57:01.831 --> 01:57:03.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what other people experience,</v>

2233
01:57:03.181 --> 01:57:05.910
<v Speaker 4>whether it's under the influence of</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic drugs or whether it's</v>

2234
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.730
<v Speaker 4>completely sober or whether it's been in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a meditative state.</v>

2235
01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:12.540
<v Speaker 4>The idea that anybody can tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you experienced or what you got out of</v>

2236
01:57:12.541 --> 01:57:15.450
<v Speaker 4>something is foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then it becomes a matter of whether</v>

2237
01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:19.020
<v Speaker 4>or not we're protecting people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if our laws are designed to protect</v>

2238
01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:21.000
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should do it scientifically.</v>

2239
01:57:21.001 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 4>We should look across the board at all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the damaging things and we don't do that</v>

2240
01:57:24.901 --> 01:57:27.240
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the government never</v>

2241
01:57:27.241 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 4>discusses cigarettes because we all know</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people cigarettes kill every</v>

2242
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

2243
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:33.660
<v Speaker 4>It's in the hundreds of thousands and no</v>
<v Speaker 4>one brings it up.</v>

2244
01:57:33.661 --> 01:57:36.270
<v Speaker 4>No one running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one running for Congress.</v>

2245
01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.820
<v Speaker 4>They just don't bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not something they want to fight</v>

2246
01:57:38.821 --> 01:57:41.190
<v Speaker 4>against because if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll get slaughtered with money.</v>

2247
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:44.550
<v Speaker 4>So it's not about whether or not they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to protect us.</v>

2248
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:46.800
<v Speaker 4>So then what is it about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although at the same time,</v>

2249
01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:49.500
<v Speaker 4>cigarette use has been going down a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little.</v>

2250
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.960
<v Speaker 4>It's still half a million people die</v>
<v Speaker 4>every year in this country.</v>

2251
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.830
<v Speaker 4>It's still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2252
01:57:53.130 --> 01:57:55.020
<v Speaker 4>it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2253
01:57:55.021 --> 01:57:58.350
<v Speaker 4>If it was just 5,000 people in pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how quick would they shut it down?</v>

2254
01:57:58.830 --> 01:58:01.890
<v Speaker 4>If 5,000 people died prematurely?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every year because of marijuana,</v>

2255
01:58:01.891 --> 01:58:05.030
<v Speaker 4>how quick would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Demon of television?</v>

2256
01:58:05.031 --> 01:58:08.400
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the benefit side of the equation.</v>

2257
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:10.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody doesn't exist though.</v>

2258
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:12.420
<v Speaker 4>Hold the unit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see what I'm saying?</v>

2259
01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:15.080
<v Speaker 4>Like 35,000 isn't dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2260
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:20.340
<v Speaker 4>But if it was the 500,000 or diving from</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes are extremely significant,</v>

2261
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:21.840
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what should be done,</v>

2262
01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:27.030
<v Speaker 4>but we should do is make everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>legal and then let people figure out</v>

2263
01:58:27.031 --> 01:58:28.700
<v Speaker 4>what you want to do and not want to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2264
01:58:28.710 --> 01:58:30.900
<v Speaker 4>which is what we do with most things</v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

2265
01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most things like cigarettes and alcohol</v>

2266
01:58:33.091 --> 01:58:34.770
<v Speaker 4>that can kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We let you try.</v>

2267
01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Exactly because no one should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you what to do.</v>

2268
01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to Charles boot Koski it and</v>

2269
01:58:39.211 --> 01:58:42.200
<v Speaker 4>just drink and smoke yourself to an</v>
<v Speaker 4>early grave and just</v>

2270
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 1>scribble the coolest shit along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>

2271
01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 1>It's all finite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2272
01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Who's one person tell another person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can't be Amex,</v>

2273
01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:52.420
<v Speaker 1>jump or skydive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2274
01:58:52.890 --> 01:58:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be free.</v>

2275
01:58:55.421 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to be free to do what I feel I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>

2276
01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:00.070
<v Speaker 1>You should have the same freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are hurting yourself,</v>

2277
01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:05.071
<v Speaker 1>I am compassionate and let's try to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you struggling with your own trauma</v>

2278
01:59:05.531 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2279
01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:08.750
<v Speaker 1>but not to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2280
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:11.840
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about rock climbers and</v>

2281
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:13.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to get safe</v>

2282
01:59:13.061 --> 01:59:15.910
<v Speaker 1>equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either run with bad childhoods.</v>

2283
01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He cut them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2284
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:23.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can make choices about risk in</v>

2285
01:59:23.621 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 1>different ways and I think you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>

2286
01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does it shade into suicide and.</v>

2287
01:59:32.630 --> 01:59:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think suicide should be illegal.</v>

2288
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:35.570
<v Speaker 1>There's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2289
01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2290
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I think there should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2291
01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should be punished if</v>

2292
01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:49.610
<v Speaker 1>you tried to get committed suicide and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you survived then fuck right.</v>

2293
01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he need that America</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it should be against the</v>

2294
01:59:56.061 --> 02:00:00.710
<v Speaker 1>law and I think this is suicide when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are end of life and pain.</v>

2295
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense to me certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there has to be a lot of</v>

2296
02:00:04.190 --> 02:00:06.530
<v Speaker 1>protections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think there is this general</v>

2297
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>feeling like life is a gift that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that somehow we need to run its</v>

2298
02:00:12.201 --> 02:00:14.390
<v Speaker 1>course rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2299
02:00:14.391 --> 02:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I think this is another way we're mtma</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy will help.</v>

2300
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think that there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are haunted by their memories,</v>

2301
02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>memories of their past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories of their own failures,</v>

2302
02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>

2303
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Memories of things that they did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those things can really fuck with</v>

2304
02:00:27.291 --> 02:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2305
02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>people define themselves in this weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way like by their past failures like</v>

2306
02:00:32.991 --> 02:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all the experience they have.</v>

2307
02:00:35.090 --> 02:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>That's all they know of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2308
02:00:36.810 --> 02:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

2309
02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>People have a very difficult time just</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2310
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well those things are things that I'll</v>

2311
02:00:42.981 --> 02:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>never do again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made these mistakes and now I'm this</v>

2312
02:00:45.651 --> 02:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>person who's learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really hard jump for some</v>

2313
02:00:48.501 --> 02:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>people because they need some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory definition of their patterns of</v>

2314
02:00:52.761 --> 02:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>behavior and when the memory definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they look in their own memory and</v>

2315
02:00:55.911 --> 02:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>everything is just failures and coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up short and Mr Ren and car got</v>

2316
02:01:00.231 --> 02:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>repossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of failures over and over</v>

2317
02:01:02.361 --> 02:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and over again stack up and you define</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself by those failures and it</v>

2318
02:01:06.171 --> 02:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>becomes really hard to move forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really hard for people and</v>

2319
02:01:09.621 --> 02:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>so each little positive step that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do can be so significant because it</v>

2320
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:17.900
<v Speaker 1>alters the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just all like there was this Tony</v>

2321
02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Robbins thing once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate them,</v>

2322
02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>quote Tony Robbins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got some really good quotes,</v>

2323
02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about was how it was just incremental</v>

2324
02:01:24.471 --> 02:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>changes in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have two cars that are going</v>

2325
02:01:27.471 --> 02:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>or two boats that are going in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction and one veers off course,</v>

2326
02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>just five degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if they both go 10 miles,</v>

2327
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:37.580
<v Speaker 1>this one goes further and further and</v>
<v Speaker 1>further from the other one and it keeps</v>

2328
02:01:37.581 --> 02:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>going further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going,</v>

2329
02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The course.</v>

2330
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:44.810
<v Speaker 4>It changes the direction and MDM a</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy or any sort of a psychedelic</v>

2331
02:01:44.811 --> 02:01:49.811
<v Speaker 4>experience that's boundary dissolving</v>
<v Speaker 4>and an ego dissolving and it just gets</v>

2332
02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:54.260
<v Speaker 4>to the raw heart of the matter and</v>
<v Speaker 4>allows you this really intense</v>

2333
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:56.780
<v Speaker 4>perspective on it that's almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>unattainable.</v>

2334
02:01:56.781 --> 02:02:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Without those experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that person leaves that and they</v>

2335
02:02:00.861 --> 02:02:04.820
<v Speaker 4>have almost like a fresh start in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh understanding of who they are.</v>

2336
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.620
<v Speaker 4>They self defined differently and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in itself is like a recipe for success.</v>

2337
02:02:10.090 --> 02:02:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this beautiful part of accepting</v>

2338
02:02:14.321 --> 02:02:18.520
<v Speaker 3>oneself and loving oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with all of these failures.</v>

2339
02:02:18.521 --> 02:02:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Even with everything that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that you deny that it happened</v>

2340
02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:25.420
<v Speaker 3>or you don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just this sense that you can relax</v>

2341
02:02:25.421 --> 02:02:30.421
<v Speaker 3>and feel that self love and that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's so rare and I think that's why</v>

2342
02:02:31.630 --> 02:02:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Mtma is one of the most popular illegal</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs in the world and why it needs and</v>

2343
02:02:39.311 --> 02:02:44.311
<v Speaker 3>will become a madison and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I selected it is also because</v>

2344
02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:49.420
<v Speaker 3>training therapists reaching to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream so that when we talk about</v>

2345
02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:53.350
<v Speaker 3>how do we incorporate this as a madison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's with healers.</v>

2346
02:02:53.351 --> 02:02:58.351
<v Speaker 3>It's with doctors and therapists and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think what we found is that we have FDA</v>

2347
02:02:58.391 --> 02:03:02.890
<v Speaker 3>permission for a study where we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>administer it to therapists and part of</v>

2348
02:03:02.891 --> 02:03:05.260
<v Speaker 3>our training program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're studying the psychological effects</v>

2349
02:03:05.261 --> 02:03:08.890
<v Speaker 3>of Mtma taken by healthy volunteers in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic setting.</v>

2350
02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a double blind crossover,</v>

2351
02:03:11.711 --> 02:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>placebo controlled study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can bring in therapists from all</v>

2352
02:03:15.101 --> 02:03:19.270
<v Speaker 3>over the world and give them an MMA</v>
<v Speaker 3>session where they are the patient and</v>

2353
02:03:19.271 --> 02:03:21.700
<v Speaker 3>they're seeing our method of how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deliver it.</v>

2354
02:03:21.701 --> 02:03:26.230
<v Speaker 3>And so Mtma is something that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>will have a smoother,</v>

2355
02:03:26.231 --> 02:03:31.231
<v Speaker 3>easier way into psychiatry and into</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapy because of it so gentle</v>

2356
02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.280
<v Speaker 3>because it isn't so much ego dissolving</v>
<v Speaker 3>as ego.</v>

2357
02:03:36.281 --> 02:03:41.281
<v Speaker 3>Clarifying your defenses are relaxed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of accept yourself for who</v>

2358
02:03:42.671 --> 02:03:47.671
<v Speaker 3>you are so you can see more clearly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how you integrate that and how you</v>

2359
02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:52.050
<v Speaker 3>make it so that that affects your daily</v>
<v Speaker 3>life</v>

2360
02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:54.100
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really important.</v>

2361
02:03:54.101 --> 02:03:56.230
<v Speaker 4>You were saying about it being a magical</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

2362
02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.110
<v Speaker 4>so one of the most manageable</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences or all the psychedelics</v>

2363
02:03:59.230 --> 02:04:01.000
<v Speaker 4>because it feels really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2364
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you're going to have a bad</v>

2365
02:04:03.071 --> 02:04:05.980
<v Speaker 4>trip for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although some of the veterans have said,</v>

2366
02:04:05.981 --> 02:04:08.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why they call this ecstasy.</v>

2367
02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they're going through this</v>

2368
02:04:10.811 --> 02:04:13.050
<v Speaker 4>trauma from their war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

2369
02:04:13.051 --> 02:04:17.920
<v Speaker 4>it's so even under the experience of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mtma or under the influence of Mtma it</v>

2370
02:04:17.921 --> 02:04:19.990
<v Speaker 4>still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't like the fact that it was</v>

2371
02:04:19.991 --> 02:04:21.280
<v Speaker 4>bringing back those memories?</v>

2372
02:04:21.570 --> 02:04:21.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2373
02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:23.790
<v Speaker 3>they liked it because that was her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this healing.</v>

2374
02:04:23.791 --> 02:04:26.850
<v Speaker 3>But it was painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it makes the pain bearable.</v>

2375
02:04:26.851 --> 02:04:29.790
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make the pain go away or it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't change your memory.</v>

2376
02:04:29.791 --> 02:04:30.800
<v Speaker 3>Like it didn't happen.</v>

2377
02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Well I suppose someone had board so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really can't imagine what their</v>

2378
02:04:35.981 --> 02:04:38.240
<v Speaker 4>experiences are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

2379
02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:39.380
<v Speaker 3>could be even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2380
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:42.750
<v Speaker 3>childhood sexual abuse and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust your parents or you can't trust</v>

2381
02:04:42.751 --> 02:04:44.250
<v Speaker 3>your circumstances are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2382
02:04:44.251 --> 02:04:45.750
<v Speaker 3>It's all terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

2383
02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how people can get into these</v>

2384
02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

2385
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:54.960
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it seems like,</v>

2386
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:59.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the technical Mtma is part of</v>

2387
02:04:59.431 --> 02:05:02.970
<v Speaker 3>the technologies appealing that it's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that we were talking about</v>

2388
02:05:02.971 --> 02:05:06.600
<v Speaker 3>with Jamie before this podcast started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before you got here,</v>

2389
02:05:06.601 --> 02:05:11.310
<v Speaker 3>we were saying how ridiculous it is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes so long to get things passed</v>

2390
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:15.060
<v Speaker 3>and that the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dea is going to review marijuana in</v>

2391
02:05:15.061 --> 02:05:18.510
<v Speaker 3>July.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they have this thing in July.</v>

2392
02:05:18.690 --> 02:05:19.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2393
02:05:19.051 --> 02:05:22.530
<v Speaker 3>they're going to say no and we've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>working to explain what they're gonna</v>

2394
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.400
<v Speaker 3>say no to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that the request is that</v>

2395
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:29.100
<v Speaker 3>marijuana be rescheduled from schedule</v>
<v Speaker 3>one to schedule two.</v>

2396
02:05:29.770 --> 02:05:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

2397
02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.970
<v Speaker 3>this rescheduling the framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind,</v>

2398
02:05:35.971 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 3>could you explain what the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between scheduled ones because we're too</v>

2399
02:05:38.110 --> 02:05:39.150
<v Speaker 3>far from the point of view.</v>

2400
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:43.200
<v Speaker 3>So the schedule one is the worst drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have no medicinal value,</v>

2401
02:05:43.210 --> 02:05:46.680
<v Speaker 3>no medicinal value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no current,</v>

2402
02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:50.400
<v Speaker 3>they're not currently accepted medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no currently accepted safety</v>

2403
02:05:50.401 --> 02:05:53.760
<v Speaker 3>under medical supervision and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>currently accepted medical use and high</v>

2404
02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:57.810
<v Speaker 3>potential for abuse scheduled two drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are the most heavily</v>

2405
02:05:57.811 --> 02:06:02.811
<v Speaker 3>criminalized drugs scheduled to except</v>
<v Speaker 3>for certain exceptions in schedule two,</v>

2406
02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.670
<v Speaker 3>which are also drugs with a high abuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential,</v>

2407
02:06:05.671 --> 02:06:10.170
<v Speaker 3>but have an accepted medical use like</v>
<v Speaker 3>methamphetamine and cocaine and cocaine</v>

2408
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:14.570
<v Speaker 3>and heroin and heroin is not in the u s</v>
<v Speaker 3>but opiates,</v>

2409
02:06:14.571 --> 02:06:16.770
<v Speaker 3>all the opiates or heroin is illegal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>England,</v>

2410
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:19.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's been blocked here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2411
02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:24.650
<v Speaker 3>But oxycontin's are scheduled who every</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine that you can get and scheduled</v>

2412
02:06:24.651 --> 02:06:26.520
<v Speaker 3>chats essentially the same as heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2413
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very sometimes more dangerous in</v>

2414
02:06:29.251 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 3>certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The psych psych,</v>

2415
02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:32.933
<v Speaker 3>it's a synthetic.</v>

2416
02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:34.440
<v Speaker 3>It has very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2417
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Affects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2418
02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:39.980
<v Speaker 3>but it has medical use for pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so moving from schedule one for</v>

2419
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:42.030
<v Speaker 3>scheduled too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been efforts to try to force the</v>

2420
02:06:42.031 --> 02:06:45.030
<v Speaker 3>dea to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way the schedules are set up,</v>

2421
02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:50.031
<v Speaker 3>there has to be a currently accepted</v>
<v Speaker 3>medical use and the data is not there.</v>

2422
02:06:50.161 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 3>And you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talked before about you know,</v>

2423
02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:54.120
<v Speaker 3>when do you have enough anecdotal data</v>
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>

2424
02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:58.800
<v Speaker 3>I believe that we are so capable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fooling ourselves into believing what we</v>

2425
02:06:58.801 --> 02:07:01.890
<v Speaker 3>want to believe and to seeing Jesus when</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus might not be there,</v>

2426
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:04.740
<v Speaker 3>that we need science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should take marijuana through the</v>

2427
02:07:04.741 --> 02:07:07.410
<v Speaker 3>drug development system and we should</v>
<v Speaker 3>take the psychedelics.</v>

2428
02:07:07.890 --> 02:07:10.740
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were about to start a study with</v>

2429
02:07:10.741 --> 02:07:12.990
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I basically started trying to do drug</v>

2430
02:07:12.991 --> 02:07:15.090
<v Speaker 3>development research with marijuana in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1992.</v>

2431
02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:20.300
<v Speaker 3>This is the first time in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but since there's no established medical</v>

2432
02:07:20.971 --> 02:07:24.660
<v Speaker 3>benefits of marijuana that had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>proven in any scientific way.</v>

2433
02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of evidence in phase</v>

2434
02:07:27.841 --> 02:07:32.841
<v Speaker 3>two pilot studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the definition of real proof is</v>

2435
02:07:33.091 --> 02:07:37.150
<v Speaker 3>phase three studies these large scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies that you work and negotiate with</v>

2436
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Fda for the marijuana plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now gw pharmaceuticals is a company in</v>

2437
02:07:42.221 --> 02:07:45.190
<v Speaker 3>England that grows marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes extracts,</v>

2438
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:48.820
<v Speaker 3>sativex it's a teaching and cbd</v>
<v Speaker 3>combination and a pill.</v>

2439
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:54.120
<v Speaker 3>And then they also have epidiolex which</v>
<v Speaker 3>is cbd for childhood epilepsy.</v>

2440
02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:57.850
<v Speaker 3>So they are in phase three studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are people working with</v>

2441
02:07:57.851 --> 02:08:02.650
<v Speaker 3>marijuana extracts in different</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsmoking delivery systems going</v>

2442
02:08:02.651 --> 02:08:07.651
<v Speaker 3>through the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the plant itself is highly</v>

2443
02:08:07.721 --> 02:08:10.360
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't cause lung cancer if you</v>

2444
02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:12.610
<v Speaker 3>smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you vaporize it,</v>

2445
02:08:12.670 --> 02:08:16.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even less irritating to lungs.</v>

2446
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:21.480
<v Speaker 3>And there's the possibility that a low</v>
<v Speaker 3>cost plant in Israel right now,</v>

2447
02:08:24.641 --> 02:08:27.850
<v Speaker 3>they grow high potency trimmed buds for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fifty cents a gram,</v>

2448
02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:29.050
<v Speaker 3>$14 an ounce.</v>

2449
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:33.970
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's public benefit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>making the marijuana plant in smoked or</v>

2450
02:08:33.971 --> 02:08:38.971
<v Speaker 3>vaporized form into a madison available</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid for by insurance as a alternative</v>

2451
02:08:40.061 --> 02:08:43.870
<v Speaker 3>to all these other medicines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is no effort right now.</v>

2452
02:08:44.050 --> 02:08:47.140
<v Speaker 3>We're starting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six years ago we started a study for</v>

2453
02:08:47.141 --> 02:08:51.530
<v Speaker 3>marijuana for ptsd and veterans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've talked about Mtma and the idea</v>

2454
02:08:51.531 --> 02:08:53.920
<v Speaker 3>is to help people with a few MTMA</v>
<v Speaker 3>sessions,</v>

2455
02:08:53.921 --> 02:08:55.660
<v Speaker 3>not need Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not need drugs,</v>

2456
02:08:56.230 --> 02:08:59.890
<v Speaker 3>sort of reorganize their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people with ptsd</v>

2457
02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 3>that find marijuana to be helpful if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the nightmares,</v>

2458
02:09:02.921 --> 02:09:05.830
<v Speaker 3>they're more present focused and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

2459
02:09:05.890 --> 02:09:10.210
<v Speaker 3>well maybe I don't want to do this Mtma</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's a supplement.</v>

2460
02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:13.840
<v Speaker 3>So there's never been a study of</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana for PTSD.</v>

2461
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:19.230
<v Speaker 3>There's been a lots and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anecdotal reports,</v>

2462
02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:20.770
<v Speaker 3>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2463
02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:23.860
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people saying that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful in different ways,</v>

2464
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.480
<v Speaker 3>but marijuana is a palliative meaning</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it just treats the symptoms and</v>

2465
02:09:28.481 --> 02:09:30.070
<v Speaker 3>it's used usually everyday.</v>

2466
02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:33.970
<v Speaker 3>So it's taken us six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're about to start the study and it</v>

2467
02:09:33.971 --> 02:09:36.970
<v Speaker 3>will take us another several years to</v>
<v Speaker 3>finish it.</v>

2468
02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:41.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of it will be at Johns Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it will be an Arizona at 76</v>

2469
02:09:41.531 --> 02:09:44.830
<v Speaker 3>veterans with chronic treatment</v>
<v Speaker 3>resistant ptsd and retesting one sample</v>

2470
02:09:44.831 --> 02:09:47.110
<v Speaker 3>that's high thc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that's high cbd,</v>

2471
02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.150
<v Speaker 3>one that's kind of thc cbd combination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one placebo and we've got a two</v>

2472
02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:54.460
<v Speaker 3>point $1,000,000 grant from the state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>

2473
02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Colorado to do this study and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a definitive thing.</v>

2474
02:09:59.171 --> 02:10:01.000
<v Speaker 3>And because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're nonprofit,</v>

2475
02:10:01.001 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 3>we're giving away the protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no intellectual property like</v>

2476
02:10:04.391 --> 02:10:06.670
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a for profit company,</v>

2477
02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:11.460
<v Speaker 3>private privateer that actually has</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought them early brand and they have a</v>

2478
02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>venture capital and they have um,</v>

2479
02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.530
<v Speaker 3>hustle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arius Tilray,</v>

2480
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:22.390
<v Speaker 3>which is a big production of marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>production factory in British Columbia.</v>

2481
02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Supplies like 5,000 patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're owned by private tier and we've</v>

2482
02:10:26.861 --> 02:10:30.160
<v Speaker 3>given them our marijuana protocol and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to use the study with our</v>

2483
02:10:30.161 --> 02:10:32.380
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does with the same study design but with</v>

2484
02:10:32.381 --> 02:10:34.610
<v Speaker 3>their marijuana and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaporize and they're going to,</v>

2485
02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.520
<v Speaker 3>we're going to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a new study starting in</v>

2486
02:10:37.521 --> 02:10:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this guy who's grandchild had</v>

2487
02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:45.140
<v Speaker 3>pediatric epilepsy and nothing helped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they tried to cbd and it</v>

2488
02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:48.230
<v Speaker 3>stopped the epileptic seizures to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great extent.</v>

2489
02:10:48.231 --> 02:10:52.550
<v Speaker 3>And then the father donated 33 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the University of Sydney for cannabis</v>

2490
02:10:52.551 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the largest grant in the history of</v>

2491
02:10:54.951 --> 02:10:58.040
<v Speaker 3>the University of Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to take our protocol</v>

2492
02:10:58.250 --> 02:11:03.250
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to get marijuana from</v>
<v Speaker 3>tilray but put into capsules as edibles.</v>

2493
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:06.200
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to have three different</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies,</v>

2494
02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:09.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar in design,</v>

2495
02:11:09.591 --> 02:11:12.080
<v Speaker 3>but smoked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaporized and edibles.</v>

2496
02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:17.140
<v Speaker 3>We're going to combine the data and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the scientific process,</v>

2497
02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:19.610
<v Speaker 3>but it'll take us.</v>

2498
02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:21.470
<v Speaker 3>It's taken us six years so far just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the study,</v>

2499
02:11:21.471 --> 02:11:23.750
<v Speaker 3>even started the study will be three</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2500
02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:27.350
<v Speaker 3>then we'll learn from it and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably need to do another three,</v>

2501
02:11:27.351 --> 02:11:29.600
<v Speaker 3>four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>study a phase three because this is just</v>

2502
02:11:29.601 --> 02:11:31.610
<v Speaker 3>phase two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the meantime we have to break the</v>

2503
02:11:31.611 --> 02:11:34.790
<v Speaker 3>government monopoly on marijuana because</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the US we're stuck with the</v>

2504
02:11:34.791 --> 02:11:38.690
<v Speaker 3>government marijuana and explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2505
02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:44.320
<v Speaker 3>the police in 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 3>andy while actually at Harvard wanted to</v>

2506
02:11:44.731 --> 02:11:47.840
<v Speaker 3>do study with marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the federal government started</v>

2507
02:11:47.841 --> 02:11:51.170
<v Speaker 3>with farm at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi to grow marijuana for</v>

2508
02:11:51.171 --> 02:11:56.171
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ever since then the National</v>

2509
02:11:56.690 --> 02:11:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Institute of Drug Abuse has contracts</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2510
02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:00.170
<v Speaker 3>And so the University of Mississippi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a professor,</v>

2511
02:12:00.171 --> 02:12:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I'll solely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is now in charge,</v>

2512
02:12:02.630 --> 02:12:07.630
<v Speaker 3>they're the only federally licensed dea</v>
<v Speaker 3>licensed marijuana in America and the</v>

2513
02:12:07.671 --> 02:12:12.230
<v Speaker 3>FDA is a federal agency so it can only</v>
<v Speaker 3>work with drugs that are federally</v>

2514
02:12:12.231 --> 02:12:12.920
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>

2515
02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:16.820
<v Speaker 3>So the only source of marijuana in</v>
<v Speaker 3>America that can be used in clinical</v>

2516
02:12:16.821 --> 02:12:21.080
<v Speaker 3>research is this marijuana controlled by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nationalist on drug abuse,</v>

2517
02:12:21.081 --> 02:12:26.081
<v Speaker 3>which has been anti marijuana with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract with the University of</v>

2518
02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have tried maps as tried starting</v>

2519
02:12:29.451 --> 02:12:34.451
<v Speaker 3>in 2000 to break this monopoly and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>submitted a application in 2001 with</v>

2520
02:12:35.151 --> 02:12:40.151
<v Speaker 3>Professor Lyle craker at Umass amherst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we won a dea administrative law</v>

2521
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:42.800
<v Speaker 3>judge lawsuit the second time I've sued</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dea in one,</v>

2522
02:12:43.370 --> 02:12:47.180
<v Speaker 3>but in the end they ignore the judges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ignore the science and the politics</v>

2523
02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:51.170
<v Speaker 3>takes over and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we lost in the appeals court in</v>

2524
02:12:51.171 --> 02:12:53.870
<v Speaker 3>2013.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way I described that,</v>

2525
02:12:53.871 --> 02:12:56.660
<v Speaker 3>we have this 960 grams of super pure</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mtma,</v>

2526
02:12:56.661 --> 02:12:58.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government.</v>

2527
02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:01.040
<v Speaker 3>What did they say when they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing?</v>

2528
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 3>They said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2529
02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:05.330
<v Speaker 3>that the government had an adequate</v>
<v Speaker 3>supply.</v>

2530
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:09.860
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean for everybody in all</v>
<v Speaker 3>research or the research?</v>

2531
02:13:09.861 --> 02:13:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We show that they didn't have what we</v>

2532
02:13:11.421 --> 02:13:15.070
<v Speaker 3>needed and also meaning that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2533
02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:18.470
<v Speaker 3>there has to be an adequate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uninterrupted did supply produced under</v>

2534
02:13:18.471 --> 02:13:20.900
<v Speaker 3>adequately competitive conditions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2535
02:13:20.901 --> 02:13:24.470
<v Speaker 3>also did you factor in the fact of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>different strains have different</v>

2536
02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:26.210
<v Speaker 3>responses?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2537
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2538
02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:30.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're using these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2539
02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2540
02:13:31.531 --> 02:13:32.540
<v Speaker 3>But the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they,</v>

2541
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:35.190
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they understand that there's different</v>

2542
02:13:35.250 --> 02:13:37.380
<v Speaker 3>strains are associated with different</v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>

2543
02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Only recently have they had any CBD</v>
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>

2544
02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:45.440
<v Speaker 3>So gw pharmaceuticals started in 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Combining saddleback's was thc and CBD.</v>

2545
02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:51.630
<v Speaker 3>It was up until just last year that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the US government could provide</v>

2546
02:13:51.631 --> 02:13:55.680
<v Speaker 3>marijuana with cbd in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've not been focused on making these</v>

2547
02:13:55.681 --> 02:13:59.370
<v Speaker 3>things into medicines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more low potency research into the</v>

2548
02:13:59.371 --> 02:14:04.371
<v Speaker 3>risks of marijuana and it's the final</v>
<v Speaker 3>next step in the medical marijuana story</v>

2549
02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:09.980
<v Speaker 3>is to end the obstruction on privately</v>
<v Speaker 3>funded drug development research,</v>

2550
02:14:11.641 --> 02:14:13.290
<v Speaker 3>trying to make the plant into a madison.</v>

2551
02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:16.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ironically,</v>

2552
02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:21.120
<v Speaker 3>it's easier to do research with</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics than with marijuana to try</v>

2553
02:14:21.121 --> 02:14:25.230
<v Speaker 3>to make it into a madison because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>control our drug.</v>

2554
02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:28.140
<v Speaker 3>So I'm getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a GMP Mtma I,</v>

2555
02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:31.680
<v Speaker 3>it's the same stuff we're going to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>in phase three that we want to market.</v>

2556
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:36.030
<v Speaker 3>But the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana can only be used in research.</v>

2557
02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:39.600
<v Speaker 3>It can't be marketed and because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>strains are all so different,</v>

2558
02:14:39.601 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 3>we can't show marijuana helps for ptsd</v>
<v Speaker 3>with one strain and then just say,</v>

2559
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:45.810
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give us approval for any other strain.</v>

2560
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we need to use this.</v>

2561
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:50.580
<v Speaker 3>And this is the true for FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for other botanicals.</v>

2562
02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:52.770
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to do a study in</v>
<v Speaker 3>botanical medicines,</v>

2563
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:55.080
<v Speaker 3>those phase three study needs to be with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>

2564
02:14:55.650 --> 02:14:57.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent batch that you want to</v>

2565
02:14:57.661 --> 02:14:58.381
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2566
02:14:58.381 --> 02:15:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is all important because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>want the same sort of stringent process</v>

2567
02:15:03.031 --> 02:15:07.200
<v Speaker 3>to be taking place for a drug safer</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritis or something like that.</v>

2568
02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Like there's so many drugs that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been gone through clinical trials and</v>

2569
02:15:10.531 --> 02:15:13.230
<v Speaker 3>wind up still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even after all that being dangerous.</v>

2570
02:15:13.710 --> 02:15:16.140
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with this is that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>know it's not dangerous.</v>

2571
02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:19.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's any question</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever about whether or not it's</v>

2572
02:15:19.021 --> 02:15:20.070
<v Speaker 3>hurting anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2573
02:15:20.071 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 3>and what I'm basically saying is about</v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance and a science so that it</v>

2574
02:15:24.511 --> 02:15:25.890
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is marijuana should be</v>

2575
02:15:25.891 --> 02:15:28.440
<v Speaker 3>legal right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course people should be able to get</v>

2576
02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:30.990
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The process that we're trying to go</v>

2577
02:15:30.991 --> 02:15:35.310
<v Speaker 3>through with making the marijuana plant</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a medicine is solving the</v>

2578
02:15:35.311 --> 02:15:38.970
<v Speaker 3>fundamental issue that all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana states that have</v>

2579
02:15:38.971 --> 02:15:41.850
<v Speaker 3>approved medical marijuana laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patients have to buy the medicine</v>

2580
02:15:41.851 --> 02:15:44.550
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get it covered by insurance.</v>

2581
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:49.080
<v Speaker 3>That'll only happen when you go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the FDA and you've made it federally</v>

2582
02:15:49.081 --> 02:15:53.820
<v Speaker 3>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the intention is to make it so that</v>

2583
02:15:53.821 --> 02:15:58.050
<v Speaker 3>people can get their medicine so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get it paid for by insurance.</v>

2584
02:15:58.050 --> 02:15:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Is that the intention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2585
02:15:59.670 --> 02:16:01.260
<v Speaker 3>it's like a medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2586
02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the way to do that is to make it</v>

2587
02:16:04.201 --> 02:16:06.750
<v Speaker 3>federally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best pathway you think the</v>

2588
02:16:06.751 --> 02:16:08.520
<v Speaker 3>federal legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2589
02:16:08.521 --> 02:16:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I think by I'm talking about fairly</v>
<v Speaker 3>legalized for medicine,</v>

2590
02:16:12.530 --> 02:16:16.500
<v Speaker 3>so to go through the FDA process then</v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance companies,</v>

2591
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean they couldn't be doing studies</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and look at the fact that people are</v>

2592
02:16:21.811 --> 02:16:26.460
<v Speaker 3>using marijuana instead of a lot of more</v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive pharmaceutical medications and</v>

2593
02:16:26.461 --> 02:16:28.470
<v Speaker 3>that from an insurance company point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

2594
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:33.500
<v Speaker 3>it could be wise to subsidize marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now it just hasn't happened yet.</v>

2595
02:16:34.751 --> 02:16:37.690
<v Speaker 3>As far as I'm aware that insurance</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies in Canada,</v>

2596
02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:41.390
<v Speaker 3>the Canadian government pays for medical</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana for veterans,</v>

2597
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:44.110
<v Speaker 3>CSD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Canadian government pays for that.</v>

2598
02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Even though there's been no science are</v>
<v Speaker 3>these studies that are.</v>

2599
02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:51.460
<v Speaker 3>These three studies will be the first on</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana for Ptsd controlled studies</v>

2600
02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:57.660
<v Speaker 3>and so there's the likelihood that once</v>
<v Speaker 3>we make it into an FDA approved</v>

2601
02:16:59.261 --> 02:17:01.840
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance companies will then be</v>

2602
02:17:02.590 --> 02:17:07.000
<v Speaker 3>willing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's federally legal to cover it as</v>

2603
02:17:07.001 --> 02:17:10.720
<v Speaker 3>a medicine for what has been proved to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be particularly if it saves them money</v>

2604
02:17:10.721 --> 02:17:11.680
<v Speaker 3>on other medicines.</v>

2605
02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's the cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2606
02:17:13.901 --> 02:17:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Then the pharmaceutical drug companies</v>
<v Speaker 3>are gonna.</v>

2607
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:18.520
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be a bounce back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all really.</v>

2608
02:17:18.521 --> 02:17:21.280
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's holding us back is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this nutty system that we have right now</v>

2609
02:17:21.281 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 3>that's so complicated to make something</v>
<v Speaker 3>as harmless as marijuana become legal.</v>

2610
02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the system has been blocked.</v>

2611
02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.010
<v Speaker 3>The system itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's unblocked,</v>

2612
02:17:30.011 --> 02:17:32.630
<v Speaker 3>isn't really that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just talked about how okay,</v>

2613
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:37.690
<v Speaker 3>civil war wasn't that long with with</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>

2614
02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:42.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean part of it is also resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have the resources to fund the</v>

2615
02:17:42.371 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 3>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in 1992,</v>

2616
02:17:44.411 --> 02:17:49.411
<v Speaker 3>the FDA had an advisory committee</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting that was about what to do about</v>

2617
02:17:50.111 --> 02:17:52.840
<v Speaker 3>medical marijuana and what to do about</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and should they be</v>

2618
02:17:52.841 --> 02:17:56.290
<v Speaker 3>permitted to be studied as medicines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was in 1992 the,</v>

2619
02:17:56.291 --> 02:17:59.440
<v Speaker 3>so there'd been roughly 20 years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppression of research crackdown.</v>

2620
02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:02.950
<v Speaker 3>After the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the FDA had this advisory committee</v>

2621
02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.540
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The National Institute of Drug Abuse</v>

2622
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:07.840
<v Speaker 3>convened a meeting of their animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>researchers doing studies on</v>

2623
02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:11.020
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and other drugs in animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>models trying to figure out what they</v>

2624
02:18:11.021 --> 02:18:12.970
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They recommend that human use.</v>

2625
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:18.030
<v Speaker 3>The advisory committee recommended that</v>
<v Speaker 3>human research be resumed and the FDA</v>

2626
02:18:18.041 --> 02:18:23.041
<v Speaker 3>adopted that so that we've actually had</v>
<v Speaker 3>this open door with a research at the</v>

2627
02:18:23.891 --> 02:18:28.510
<v Speaker 3>FDA if we had the resources except for</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana because marijuana was</v>

2628
02:18:28.511 --> 02:18:30.670
<v Speaker 3>controlled by the nationalist and of</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug abuse.</v>

2629
02:18:30.671 --> 02:18:33.190
<v Speaker 3>We had broken that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd gotten her own supplies of</v>

2630
02:18:33.191 --> 02:18:35.620
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as their own supplies of psilocybin.</v>

2631
02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:40.630
<v Speaker 3>So now</v>
<v Speaker 3>the system takes,</v>

2632
02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six to 10 years,</v>

2633
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:47.590
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing the research.</v>

2634
02:18:47.591 --> 02:18:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Once you have a drug that you think does</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to,</v>

2635
02:18:50.130 --> 02:18:53.170
<v Speaker 3>to prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is take some time and it costs</v>

2636
02:18:53.171 --> 02:18:56.350
<v Speaker 3>a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't cost billions like the</v>

2637
02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:57.970
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical company will tell you.</v>

2638
02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're actually,</v>

2639
02:18:59.810 --> 02:19:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to make md man to a medicine in</v>
<v Speaker 3>part because it's a demonized drug</v>

2640
02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:07.300
<v Speaker 3>because it's ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Governments over the world have spent</v>

2641
02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:11.230
<v Speaker 3>over $300,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably more by now on research with</v>

2642
02:19:11.231 --> 02:19:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go into the scientific literature</v>

2643
02:19:13.181 --> 02:19:15.640
<v Speaker 3>and medline and you put in Mtma or</v>
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy,</v>

2644
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:19.480
<v Speaker 3>there's over 5,000 papers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of science has been done but we</v>

2645
02:19:19.481 --> 02:19:24.481
<v Speaker 3>haven't had to pay for about the risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even then when we sort of take that</v>

2646
02:19:25.511 --> 02:19:29.240
<v Speaker 3>and then do the kind of studies that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to do with psychedelics,</v>

2647
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:34.190
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like the system is takes time</v>

2648
02:19:34.191 --> 02:19:36.650
<v Speaker 3>to prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we are so good at tricking ourselves</v>

2649
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:40.040
<v Speaker 3>and there is something to be said for</v>
<v Speaker 3>this process.</v>

2650
02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:43.970
<v Speaker 3>And so I think when we talk about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>come marijuana is into Madison,</v>

2651
02:19:43.971 --> 02:19:48.971
<v Speaker 3>part of it is that the process has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>gummed up for 50 years and is still</v>

2652
02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:51.650
<v Speaker 3>gummed up by this last step.</v>

2653
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was another step that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get access to this federal marijuana,</v>

2654
02:19:55.940 --> 02:20:00.940
<v Speaker 3>you had to have a public health service</v>
<v Speaker 3>review that was created in 1999 because</v>

2655
02:20:01.911 --> 02:20:04.850
<v Speaker 3>before that they only gave the marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>to government researchers.</v>

2656
02:20:04.851 --> 02:20:06.500
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't even do your own funded</v>

2657
02:20:06.501 --> 02:20:09.470
<v Speaker 3>study with marijuana through the FDA</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you couldn't get the marijuana.</v>

2658
02:20:09.471 --> 02:20:11.690
<v Speaker 3>It was only for their researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety nine.</v>

2659
02:20:11.691 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>They created this policy that would open</v>
<v Speaker 3>it up in their minds,</v>

2660
02:20:15.831 --> 02:20:18.700
<v Speaker 3>but there was a special review in</v>
<v Speaker 3>addition to FDA.</v>

2661
02:20:18.701 --> 02:20:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Dea and Irb that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we just were able to succeed in</v>

2662
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:25.640
<v Speaker 3>getting them to eliminate the Obama</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration eliminated it last</v>

2663
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:27.050
<v Speaker 3>summer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this public health service review.</v>

2664
02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:30.290
<v Speaker 3>It's what blocked our marijuana ptsd</v>
<v Speaker 3>study for years and years.</v>

2665
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:33.500
<v Speaker 3>That's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last thing to get gone is this</v>

2666
02:20:33.501 --> 02:20:36.380
<v Speaker 3>government monopoly on marijuana and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're working.</v>

2667
02:20:36.381 --> 02:20:39.740
<v Speaker 3>We're planning to resubmit an</v>
<v Speaker 3>application from professor craker.</v>

2668
02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:43.400
<v Speaker 3>We're working with Covington and burling</v>
<v Speaker 3>and big DC law firm taking the case pro</v>

2669
02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:48.401
<v Speaker 3>bono to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a legal analysis and then we will try</v>

2670
02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:53.600
<v Speaker 3>to persuade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were working with Senator Gillibrand</v>

2671
02:20:53.601 --> 02:20:58.601
<v Speaker 3>and Senator Warren and others have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>engaging the dea and on DCP,</v>

2672
02:20:58.941 --> 02:21:01.190
<v Speaker 3>hhs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human in discussions about this</v>

2673
02:21:01.191 --> 02:21:03.980
<v Speaker 3>monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's growing support in Congress and</v>

2674
02:21:03.981 --> 02:21:08.981
<v Speaker 3>this is the last vestige of a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics blocking the science with</v>

2675
02:21:09.711 --> 02:21:14.210
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics or marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the system will have to work with</v>

2676
02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:18.440
<v Speaker 3>and in the meantime people can go around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and legalize and then that gets access.</v>

2677
02:21:18.441 --> 02:21:21.590
<v Speaker 3>And so we're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait for the science to.</v>

2678
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have any fear with the upcoming</v>

2679
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 3>elections?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any fear?</v>

2680
02:21:26.001 --> 02:21:28.790
<v Speaker 3>If we go right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there might be some blowback.</v>

2681
02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I fearful that all the time.</v>

2682
02:21:32.001 --> 02:21:32.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2683
02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:37.780
<v Speaker 3>my sort of core imprint was that in 1971</v>
<v Speaker 3>I first took lsd in 1972.</v>

2684
02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:40.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided that this was what I wanted to</v>

2685
02:21:40.821 --> 02:21:45.020
<v Speaker 3>devote my life to and I looked around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I saw all the research has been shut</v>

2686
02:21:45.021 --> 02:21:46.100
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2687
02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I sort of came in one year after the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweeping prohibition.</v>

2688
02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:53.390
<v Speaker 3>I woke up to it not when it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>thriving,</v>

2689
02:21:53.391 --> 02:21:58.310
<v Speaker 3>but right after the backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think I was so motivated to</v>

2690
02:21:58.311 --> 02:22:01.010
<v Speaker 3>get involved with Mtma because I learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>about md may 19,</v>

2691
02:22:01.011 --> 02:22:04.850
<v Speaker 3>82 when it was an underground</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic psychotherapy tool under the</v>

2692
02:22:04.851 --> 02:22:07.580
<v Speaker 3>code name Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the government had no knowledge of</v>

2693
02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:10.040
<v Speaker 3>in Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was at Dallas.</v>

2694
02:22:10.041 --> 02:22:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I know Dallas is where Adam Mtma turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>into ecstasy,</v>

2695
02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:16.100
<v Speaker 3>so that's where they started selling it</v>
<v Speaker 3>above ground.</v>

2696
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:18.310
<v Speaker 3>There's an incredible movie that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come out,</v>

2697
02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:22.430
<v Speaker 3>the stork club about the club in Dallas</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it really got well known,</v>

2698
02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:26.850
<v Speaker 3>but it because it had this dual life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one as this quiet underground therapy</v>

2699
02:22:26.851 --> 02:22:31.830
<v Speaker 3>drug with about half a million doses</v>
<v Speaker 3>having been used by around 1984 and then</v>

2700
02:22:31.831 --> 02:22:35.580
<v Speaker 3>the other was this public ecstasy use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2701
02:22:35.581 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I know about it ahead of time.</v>

2702
02:22:37.531 --> 02:22:40.950
<v Speaker 3>I can see the crackdown coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody could see the crackdown</v>

2703
02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:42.630
<v Speaker 3>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now we can organize.</v>

2704
02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Now we can have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can talk to people about it.</v>

2705
02:22:45.871 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not a crime where we can gather our</v>
<v Speaker 3>forces and have people try it even,</v>

2706
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:53.560
<v Speaker 3>and that's where I became really</v>
<v Speaker 3>politically</v>

2707
02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:56.720
<v Speaker 4>involved in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2708
02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:01.880
<v Speaker 4>it's just amazing how long it's taken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's amazing that you have the</v>

2709
02:23:01.881 --> 02:23:06.650
<v Speaker 4>fortitude to push through for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the world,</v>

2710
02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:10.700
<v Speaker 4>the world and the consciousness of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2711
02:23:10.701 --> 02:23:12.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys a massive debt.</v>

2712
02:23:12.890 --> 02:23:16.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean a debt of gratitude for sure that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been out there pushing this</v>

2713
02:23:16.761 --> 02:23:21.050
<v Speaker 4>envelope and and chipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of many weapons chipping</v>

2714
02:23:21.051 --> 02:23:24.530
<v Speaker 4>at this wall of ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maps is a really powerful one.</v>

2715
02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:28.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've been able to do it in a way</v>

2716
02:23:28.351 --> 02:23:33.351
<v Speaker 3>where right now we have two senior</v>
<v Speaker 3>retired FDA officials who are acting as</v>

2717
02:23:34.351 --> 02:23:39.351
<v Speaker 3>our consultants to prepare our documents</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they felt that there is a strong</v>

2718
02:23:40.141 --> 02:23:44.010
<v Speaker 3>need for new treatments for ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they don't necessarily or saying</v>

2719
02:23:44.011 --> 02:23:47.370
<v Speaker 3>anything about cultural change or</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirituality or drug war.</v>

2720
02:23:47.371 --> 02:23:50.580
<v Speaker 3>There's this first soldiers just for</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other people,</v>

2721
02:23:50.610 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 3>everybody with ptsd that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have watched over the last 15,</v>

2722
02:23:55.111 --> 02:23:58.890
<v Speaker 3>20 years what we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually there's a woman on our</v>

2723
02:23:58.891 --> 02:24:03.330
<v Speaker 3>staff Ilsa Jerome that isn't been</v>
<v Speaker 3>reviewing all these papers,</v>

2724
02:24:03.331 --> 02:24:07.710
<v Speaker 3>all these 5,000 papers and developing</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's called a in conjunction with</v>

2725
02:24:07.711 --> 02:24:09.810
<v Speaker 3>other members of our team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2726
02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:14.430
<v Speaker 3>a investigator's brochure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a summary of the literature with a risk</v>

2727
02:24:14.431 --> 02:24:18.330
<v Speaker 3>benefit calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you take all of this information.</v>

2728
02:24:18.331 --> 02:24:20.970
<v Speaker 3>And then what does it mean in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the risks that you present to the</v>

2729
02:24:20.971 --> 02:24:25.971
<v Speaker 3>patients in the study and that you tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctors and the people at the FDA</v>

2730
02:24:27.211 --> 02:24:30.360
<v Speaker 3>thought that we were doing it fairly in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2731
02:24:30.450 --> 02:24:33.750
<v Speaker 3>in a time when it was being distorted</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different ways and Elsa is</v>

2732
02:24:33.751 --> 02:24:38.580
<v Speaker 3>actually a little bit more conservative</v>
<v Speaker 3>than I am and I knew that it was kind of</v>

2733
02:24:38.581 --> 02:24:42.990
<v Speaker 3>good to let her take the lead and</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing this and that it got the respect</v>

2734
02:24:42.991 --> 02:24:43.740
<v Speaker 3>of the FDA.</v>

2735
02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.440
<v Speaker 3>So that's where I'm</v>

2736
02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:52.320
<v Speaker 4>hopeful that isn't it kind of strange</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a mtma being used to treat ptsd is</v>

2737
02:24:52.890 --> 02:24:57.890
<v Speaker 4>a primary motivating factor for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>federal government trying to make it</v>

2738
02:24:58.120 --> 02:24:59.620
<v Speaker 4>legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you think about it,</v>

2739
02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:04.000
<v Speaker 4>ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>PTSD is inexorably associated with war.</v>

2740
02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:05.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2741
02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:10.160
<v Speaker 4>so in some sort of strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>war was responsible for accelerating the</v>

2742
02:25:11.771 --> 02:25:14.980
<v Speaker 4>legalization of Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really fucking crazy.</v>

2743
02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is like the Yin and Yang in</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a bio mechanical form,</v>

2744
02:25:20.730 --> 02:25:22.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a kito yeah,</v>

2745
02:25:22.970 --> 02:25:25.240
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really look at what that is.</v>

2746
02:25:25.350 --> 02:25:26.183
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2747
02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:27.520
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've also though,</v>

2748
02:25:27.521 --> 02:25:31.120
<v Speaker 4>what about the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next step does we've been accused of</v>

2749
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:33.790
<v Speaker 4>by our people have raised the cautionary</v>
<v Speaker 4>tale,</v>

2750
02:25:34.210 --> 02:25:36.880
<v Speaker 4>which I disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've said some people have said,</v>

2751
02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:42.930
<v Speaker 4>are you making it more easy to wage now</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you are reducing the costs of war,</v>

2752
02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:46.930
<v Speaker 4>are you making war?</v>

2753
02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.590
<v Speaker 4>It's convoluted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more likely have an option and I think</v>

2754
02:25:50.591 --> 02:25:55.591
<v Speaker 4>it's a worthwhile question to ask it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It applies to all medical doctors that</v>

2755
02:25:56.981 --> 02:26:01.981
<v Speaker 4>worked for the military surgeons you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know are are you by treating people,</v>

2756
02:26:03.101 --> 02:26:07.630
<v Speaker 4>making it easier for there to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a very narrow</v>

2757
02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:09.730
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very narrow perspective and it's</v>

2758
02:26:09.731 --> 02:26:14.731
<v Speaker 4>also not taking into consideration the</v>
<v Speaker 4>actual psychoactive effects of that</v>

2759
02:26:15.431 --> 02:26:17.800
<v Speaker 4>substance because that's substance make</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone loving.</v>

2760
02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:22.690
<v Speaker 4>So if you think that giving out pills</v>
<v Speaker 4>that make you more loving or more likely</v>

2761
02:26:22.691 --> 02:26:25.390
<v Speaker 4>going to generate more war or make more</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more palatable,</v>

2762
02:26:25.391 --> 02:26:28.750
<v Speaker 4>I think the opposite is probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the people who become more</v>

2763
02:26:28.751 --> 02:26:32.920
<v Speaker 4>loving who can relay the experiences of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrors of war to other people who</v>

2764
02:26:32.921 --> 02:26:35.800
<v Speaker 4>become more loving because they also get</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hold of this stuff,</v>

2765
02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:40.450
<v Speaker 4>then I think that's more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 4>eliminate war or lesson war or at least</v>

2766
02:26:40.451 --> 02:26:44.740
<v Speaker 4>mitigated significantly because I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that war is probably mitigated</v>

2767
02:26:44.741 --> 02:26:47.920
<v Speaker 4>significant significantly now in</v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison to like the sheer numbers of</v>

2768
02:26:47.921 --> 02:26:50.210
<v Speaker 4>people like in comparison to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2769
02:26:50.470 --> 02:26:52.300
<v Speaker 4>500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>600 years ago.</v>

2770
02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.300
<v Speaker 4>It's probably way less war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2771
02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:57.020
<v Speaker 4>I just watched a lexus fella,</v>
<v Speaker 4>steven pinker just to.</v>

2772
02:26:57.060 --> 02:26:59.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was very interesting about the reduction</v>

2773
02:26:59.741 --> 02:27:01.300
<v Speaker 4>of violence or the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2774
02:27:01.301 --> 02:27:05.050
<v Speaker 4>it's way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way safer and I think that things</v>

2775
02:27:05.051 --> 02:27:10.051
<v Speaker 4>like psychedelic drugs in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also the meditative techniques,</v>

2776
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:16.230
<v Speaker 4>focusing on being in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>focusing on learning how to manage your</v>

2777
02:27:17.141 --> 02:27:21.620
<v Speaker 4>mind and there's a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are practicing and attempting to</v>

2778
02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:25.850
<v Speaker 4>to use in their everyday life today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mindfulness and it's,</v>

2779
02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:28.630
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a subject that's repeated very</v>

2780
02:27:28.631 --> 02:27:32.620
<v Speaker 4>often and people are trying to find a</v>
<v Speaker 4>better way of approaching different</v>

2781
02:27:32.621 --> 02:27:36.010
<v Speaker 4>dilemmas in their life and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tool for those things.</v>

2782
02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:39.310
<v Speaker 4>It's a tool for those things that should</v>
<v Speaker 4>be considered alongside of yoga,</v>

2783
02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:41.950
<v Speaker 4>alongside of meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alongside of Reading,</v>

2784
02:27:41.951 --> 02:27:44.470
<v Speaker 4>self help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>books alongside of having good friends</v>

2785
02:27:44.471 --> 02:27:47.440
<v Speaker 4>you can open up with and you can discuss</v>
<v Speaker 4>things together and get encouragement</v>

2786
02:27:47.441 --> 02:27:51.010
<v Speaker 4>from each other and and maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticism from each other and all those</v>

2787
02:27:51.011 --> 02:27:54.580
<v Speaker 4>things exist in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in all sorts of different forums and</v>

2788
02:27:54.581 --> 02:27:56.410
<v Speaker 4>they exist in psychedelics as well.</v>

2789
02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:59.980
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean especially I find eating</v>

2790
02:27:59.981 --> 02:28:04.000
<v Speaker 4>marijuana to be one of the most self</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyzing,</v>

2791
02:28:04.090 --> 02:28:07.330
<v Speaker 4>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>introspective experiences you can have.</v>

2792
02:28:07.331 --> 02:28:10.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like a real wake up call to any</v>
<v Speaker 4>holes you might have in your game.</v>

2793
02:28:10.421 --> 02:28:13.750
<v Speaker 4>It just smacks you in the place and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sends you back out there in the world.</v>

2794
02:28:13.751 --> 02:28:14.321
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

2795
02:28:14.321 --> 02:28:15.001
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

2796
02:28:15.001 --> 02:28:15.834
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

2797
02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Those are tools and there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all tools that can be used in a</v>

2798
02:28:20.171 --> 02:28:23.270
<v Speaker 4>variety of different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to deny the fact that they can be</v>

2799
02:28:23.271 --> 02:28:27.950
<v Speaker 4>used beneficially at this point is</v>
<v Speaker 4>really silly because we are finite</v>

2800
02:28:27.951 --> 02:28:29.900
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live a short amount of time.</v>

2801
02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't it be nice if you got rid of</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of your bullshit by the time you</v>

2802
02:28:33.351 --> 02:28:34.420
<v Speaker 4>hit add?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2803
02:28:34.470 --> 02:28:35.303
<v Speaker 4>And it'd be nice.</v>

2804
02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:38.220
<v Speaker 3>This sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it,</v>

2805
02:28:38.221 --> 02:28:43.221
<v Speaker 3>about time that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there is a mainstream system</v>

2806
02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:48.680
<v Speaker 3>that's ready to incorporate that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaching out on the other side of yes.</v>

2807
02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:55.340
<v Speaker 3>And that this possibility of really</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrating this does seem to be the</v>

2808
02:28:55.741 --> 02:28:57.960
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think with the military,</v>

2809
02:28:58.310 --> 02:29:02.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that their training is to make</v>

2810
02:29:02.131 --> 02:29:06.690
<v Speaker 3>people who suppress their emotions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not feel the emotional consequences</v>

2811
02:29:06.691 --> 02:29:09.420
<v Speaker 3>to act in the heat of battle without the</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>

2812
02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:13.320
<v Speaker 3>And I think with Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you help people feel the emotional</v>

2813
02:29:13.321 --> 02:29:17.550
<v Speaker 3>consequences of their actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you've healed them from trauma</v>

2814
02:29:17.551 --> 02:29:22.350
<v Speaker 3>and they want to go back to their units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are going to be more careful,</v>

2815
02:29:22.351 --> 02:29:24.000
<v Speaker 3>more sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll be.</v>

2816
02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2817
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:27.150
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2818
02:29:27.470 --> 02:29:28.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2819
02:29:28.170 --> 02:29:32.940
<v Speaker 3>there's a German psychiatrist that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>Torsten Passie and he's sort of raised</v>

2820
02:29:32.941 --> 02:29:35.940
<v Speaker 3>this issue for me is what about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration camp guards?</v>

2821
02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:40.140
<v Speaker 3>What if they were tormented and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>came to you for Mtma therapy,</v>

2822
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:43.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a German therapist and they come</v>

2823
02:29:43.711 --> 02:29:45.540
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you treat the concentration</v>

2824
02:29:45.541 --> 02:29:50.541
<v Speaker 3>camp people for their trauma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the question is,</v>

2825
02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:54.390
<v Speaker 3>are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are people who are worked with in this</v>

2826
02:29:54.391 --> 02:29:58.200
<v Speaker 3>emotional way for their trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less likely to go back into</v>

2827
02:29:58.201 --> 02:30:00.190
<v Speaker 3>these situations that produced the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma in?</v>

2828
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question only becomes valid if you</v>

2829
02:30:02.641 --> 02:30:05.520
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should you punish a person who's done</v>

2830
02:30:05.521 --> 02:30:09.120
<v Speaker 4>something like that in always forever or</v>
<v Speaker 4>should you try to make them better?</v>

2831
02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:10.130
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2832
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:13.410
<v Speaker 4>did you not exonerating them for what</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrible things they've done,</v>

2833
02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:15.510
<v Speaker 4>but should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to keep them alive,</v>

2834
02:30:15.690 --> 02:30:17.820
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't you try to make them a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>person?</v>

2835
02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Do you have some sort of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do that?</v>

2836
02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.180
<v Speaker 4>I would say the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to look at our civilization</v>

2837
02:30:24.270 --> 02:30:28.500
<v Speaker 4>and the like the most efficient manner I</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to look at it and I'm like,</v>

2838
02:30:28.501 --> 02:30:30.410
<v Speaker 4>what is the best way to get our</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization together?</v>

2839
02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:32.370
<v Speaker 4>We'll have less assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less crazy people,</v>

2840
02:30:32.371 --> 02:30:34.410
<v Speaker 4>let's mean people less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2841
02:30:34.411 --> 02:30:38.040
<v Speaker 4>less psychopathic fucking security</v>
<v Speaker 4>guards at Auschwitz.</v>

2842
02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:41.370
<v Speaker 4>So if you do have one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could probably get a lot of data</v>

2843
02:30:41.371 --> 02:30:44.940
<v Speaker 4>from studying that guy and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously going to be in jail for the</v>

2844
02:30:44.941 --> 02:30:47.190
<v Speaker 4>rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was not going to hurt.</v>

2845
02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what,</v>

2846
02:30:48.130 --> 02:30:51.270
<v Speaker 4>what I was trying to say is what you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that for an active military where they,</v>

2847
02:30:51.330 --> 02:30:54.030
<v Speaker 4>it's not historical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'd go back and I'm saying,</v>

2848
02:30:54.031 --> 02:30:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I know that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you do it for a hobbit?</v>

2849
02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you get on your fucking time</v>

2850
02:30:58.111 --> 02:31:00.630
<v Speaker 4>machine and traveled back to the Roman</v>
<v Speaker 4>days given to them.</v>

2851
02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:01.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to worry about that.</v>

2852
02:31:01.850 --> 02:31:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to worry about people today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2853
02:31:03.811 --> 02:31:05.790
<v Speaker 4>And I feel that trying to bring that up</v>

2854
02:31:05.810 --> 02:31:10.810
<v Speaker 3>healing approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those loving feelings which Mtma</v>

2855
02:31:11.451 --> 02:31:13.880
<v Speaker 3>can really generate through oxytocin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>prolactin.</v>

2856
02:31:13.890 --> 02:31:17.690
<v Speaker 3>The hormone is released that are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>nursing and bonding Mtma releases those</v>

2857
02:31:17.691 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that drugs that women get when they</v>

2858
02:31:20.041 --> 02:31:20.910
<v Speaker 3>orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2859
02:31:21.180 --> 02:31:21.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2860
02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:26.850
<v Speaker 3>And actually tourists has written this</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrific paper about how organisms the</v>

2861
02:31:26.851 --> 02:31:31.470
<v Speaker 3>post orgasmic state and he's compared</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poster orgasmic state and the</v>

2862
02:31:31.471 --> 02:31:35.930
<v Speaker 3>hormonal release to Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think when we talk about Mtma,</v>

2863
02:31:35.931 --> 02:31:39.150
<v Speaker 3>a good way to think about it is the post</v>
<v Speaker 3>orgasmic state.</v>

2864
02:31:39.151 --> 02:31:40.290
<v Speaker 3>You're satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2865
02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:41.760
<v Speaker 3>you're not striving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2866
02:31:41.761 --> 02:31:44.220
<v Speaker 3>If you could come and it felt as good as</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond ecstasy.</v>

2867
02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Let's not kid ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not kid ourselves.</v>

2868
02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:53.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what come coming for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy feels like he's.</v>

2869
02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Feels like he's coming on Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright dude.</v>

2870
02:31:55.530 --> 02:31:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Settle down.</v>

2871
02:31:58.830 --> 02:32:03.830
<v Speaker 3>If I'm buying it</v>
<v Speaker 3>door summit of Mt.</v>

2872
02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm exaggerating a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>

2873
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:10.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it feels real good.</v>

2874
02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:14.310
<v Speaker 3>MTMA feels like you're not even here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some the planet love,</v>

2875
02:32:14.430 --> 02:32:16.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only did it once,</v>

2876
02:32:16.410 --> 02:32:19.590
<v Speaker 3>did it once to two pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super powerful stuff.</v>

2877
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:23.520
<v Speaker 3>The next day I was wrecked the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was not worth it for me.</v>

2878
02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I definitely learned a lot from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2879
02:32:25.681 --> 02:32:27.690
<v Speaker 3>but the next day was absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrendous.</v>

2880
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably horrendous because you</v>

2881
02:32:29.971 --> 02:32:32.740
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about people to.</v>

2882
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:36.230
<v Speaker 3>We're thinking about Mtma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we say is don't do anything else.</v>

2883
02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:39.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a two day experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need the second day to rest and</v>

2884
02:32:39.511 --> 02:32:41.640
<v Speaker 3>reflect and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the purpose of it?</v>

2885
02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:43.810
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

2886
02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:48.660
<v Speaker 3>loving experience and then kind of bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate some of that into your daily</v>

2887
02:32:48.661 --> 02:32:52.410
<v Speaker 3>life learning integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the very next day is one of the</v>

2888
02:32:52.411 --> 02:32:54.840
<v Speaker 3>most important parts because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>still halfway in,</v>

2889
02:32:54.841 --> 02:32:56.910
<v Speaker 3>halfway out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're able to think about it.</v>

2890
02:32:56.911 --> 02:32:59.940
<v Speaker 3>That's where a lot of the integration</v>
<v Speaker 3>work gets done.</v>

2891
02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:04.290
<v Speaker 3>So in our therapy we make it so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people spend the night in the treatment</v>

2892
02:33:04.291 --> 02:33:06.870
<v Speaker 3>center just so that they don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>

2893
02:33:06.871 --> 02:33:10.950
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to get distracted and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's hours of psychotherapy the</v>

2894
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:14.760
<v Speaker 3>next day to help them integrate it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when they go home we call them</v>

2895
02:33:14.761 --> 02:33:19.650
<v Speaker 3>everyday on the of per week on the phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to check in and see how they're</v>

2896
02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:21.810
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's rick,</v>

2897
02:33:22.290 --> 02:33:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rick Doblin,</v>

2898
02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:28.140
<v Speaker 3>Woodside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I just came all the time.</v>

2899
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:30.450
<v Speaker 3>All the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

2900
02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Alright man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peace out.</v>

2901
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:37.990
<v Speaker 3>We've got to wrap this up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately we started a little late</v>

2902
02:33:37.991 --> 02:33:39.440
<v Speaker 3>and I gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2903
02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything you can direct people</v>

2904
02:33:42.691 --> 02:33:46.650
<v Speaker 3>towards a website which is maps.org?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2905
02:33:46.651 --> 02:33:51.651
<v Speaker 3>And in fact we're having our 30th</v>
<v Speaker 3>anniversary celebration on Sunday,</v>

2906
02:33:51.751 --> 02:33:54.210
<v Speaker 3>April 17th and we're live streaming it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for free.</v>

2907
02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:58.570
<v Speaker 3>So it's maps.org/.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2908
02:33:58.650 --> 02:34:01.330
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to know when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are Dea agents undercover?</v>

2909
02:34:01.350 --> 02:34:04.420
<v Speaker 3>They're well tie clips actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2910
02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:09.530
<v Speaker 3>we have our first reach senior retired</v>
<v Speaker 3>dea consultant and Martin man and smart.</v>

2911
02:34:10.531 --> 02:34:11.910
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's compassion.</v>

2912
02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:16.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean he had a son who I'm listed in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the army and has ptsd and is 50 percent</v>

2913
02:34:17.291 --> 02:34:18.580
<v Speaker 3>disabled from ptsd</v>

2914
02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:20.620
<v Speaker 3>and is found marijuana to be helpful</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2915
02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:22.240
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>

2916
02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2917
02:34:23.470 --> 02:34:26.170
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of stories that helped me</v>

2918
02:34:26.171 --> 02:34:30.700
<v Speaker 3>think that we can do this integration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can and I am worried about right wing</v>

2919
02:34:30.701 --> 02:34:33.520
<v Speaker 3>backlash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a couple of things that</v>

2920
02:34:33.521 --> 02:34:34.780
<v Speaker 3>we've put into place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>

2921
02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:36.160
<v Speaker 3>to work with the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2922
02:34:36.161 --> 02:34:39.220
<v Speaker 3>right when gloves in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're trying to help the military,</v>

2923
02:34:39.221 --> 02:34:44.221
<v Speaker 3>there's also people are compassionate</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a childhood sexual abuse survivors</v>

2924
02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:49.771
<v Speaker 3>and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have enough of a base of</v>

2925
02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:56.640
<v Speaker 3>evidence and a long pattern since 1992</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the precedents at the FDA that I</v>

2926
02:34:57.401 --> 02:35:02.401
<v Speaker 3>think we could survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The FDA also recently did something very</v>

2927
02:35:02.411 --> 02:35:07.411
<v Speaker 3>interesting with the abortion pill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you 46 that they made it easier on</v>

2928
02:35:07.571 --> 02:35:09.630
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They eliminated one required step that</v>

2929
02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:14.640
<v Speaker 3>the science showed that they didn't need</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the FDA is very much trying to be</v>

2930
02:35:15.551 --> 02:35:18.270
<v Speaker 3>science over politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

2931
02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:21.460
<v Speaker 3>they will have an FDA commissioner</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's appointed by and confirmed by</v>

2932
02:35:21.461 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time the people that are</v>

2933
02:35:25.121 --> 02:35:28.570
<v Speaker 3>there are really focused on science over</v>
<v Speaker 3>politics and compassion.</v>

2934
02:35:28.571 --> 02:35:30.550
<v Speaker 3>The other part is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>international strategy.</v>

2935
02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:33.330
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time anybody ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked over the music?</v>

2936
02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:34.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

2937
02:35:34.261 --> 02:35:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Awesome information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish you didn't have it,</v>

2938
02:35:36.470 --> 02:35:38.770
<v Speaker 1>but I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

2939
02:35:38.980 --> 02:35:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag psychedelic because tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dog because what does that</v>

2940
02:35:41.821 --> 02:35:42.450
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2941
02:35:42.450 --> 02:35:43.590
<v Speaker 1>don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop.</v>

2942
