Whatever the fuck I call it.

2
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.750

3
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.010
fleshlight,
the number one adult toy from men.
I use it myself.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.870
I recommend it.
Or race dot.
Don't let people know I use it.
It's embarrassing.

5
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.180
It's embarrassing.
Listen,

8
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.680
The Joe Rogan experience.

9
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.400
<v 2>Yeah,
my girls back.
Jarrod,
that scary.
Take Black Guy.</v>

10
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.690
He had a guy that was doing,
does

11
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.550
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience that voice,
but it was,</v>

12
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.920
it was a white guys that sounded like a black guy.

13
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:05.590
You could tell it wasn't really a black guy.
All right.
You know what I'm saying?

14
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:05.820
Yeah.

15
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.970
It was a white robot that's sounding black to Freddy Lockhart has joined us.

16
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
my man,
Freddy,

17
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.860
Freddy and I go back to when Freddie was fucking cover booth man at the Goddamn

18
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.180
comedy store,
20 years old and dreadlocks back in the days.
Freddy,

19
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.030
who was trying to make it happen out here in La,

20
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:25.720
a fresh faced young boy and we became friends and we've been friends ever since.

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.350
That was a fun times,
man.
I bet it was.
And now look at me now I'm an old man.

22
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.910
Freddie is one of those,
you know,
you know that he's got some black in them,

23
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.900
but how much,
how much going on here?
Let me just strip Joe Rogan.

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
What are your yet at Dad's black mom's wife.
Standard issue.

25
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:46.420
Pretty much powerful.
Powerful combination genetic wise,
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.

26
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.130
I'll go strongest combinations of all time.
I would say so,
yeah.

27
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.570
You get the body of the black man and then you get the mind of the white man

28
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:54.610
altogether and some strange combination.

29
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.980
It's why the University of Arizona won the 1996 national championship the whole

30
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.440
way mean that black people don't have brains.
It's a different brain.

31
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.400
Don't get me wrong,

32
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.720
but I'm saying it's clearly black people have the superior bodies,
right.

33
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.110
So you gotta be crazy to argue with that.
Greatest athletes of all time,
you know,

34
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.040
to a man,
except for a few few fucking Larry Bird's in there,

35
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.760
a few weird white guys that manage to figure shit out.
Right.
Other than that,

36
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.840
I mean,
let's get real,
you know,
they're the super athletes that we're,
we're,

37
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.690
we're tracking down Jimmy the Greek a territory right now.

38
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.270
And he was absolutely right.
It was just that,
right?
Is that right?

39
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:30.910
And you're just a Douche bag.
Yeah.
He was just a Douche bag and it was just like,

40
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:33.880
you know what?
Everything he said you couldn't disagree with it.
Right?
Yeah.

41
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:36.790
It's just,
here's my problem with it.
It's not a bad thing.

42
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:38.590
You're talking about a positive attribute.

43
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.850
Why is it racist to say that black people are the superior athletes?
Right?

44
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.240
I mean,
if you just looked at the numbers,

45
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.410
the number of Michael Jordan's and Lebron James is and those,
those guys,

46
00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:50.410
those superior super dominant athletes,
right?

47
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.420
Very rarely like white guys make up what,

48
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:55.420
15% of the population American population less than that.

49
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:59.970
And they make up 90% of the NBA with a 509 in the NBA.
Calm on.
The white

50
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.790
<v 3>guys are European,
the European.</v>

51
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.940
See that's another thing Europeans like from right,

52
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.230
like Russians are a different fucking breed then white people here.
Oh yeah.

53
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:16.000
There's some hard motherfuckers and some serious athletes like you ever see

54
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.330
Carolyn the the wrestler,
it's seven foot tall,

55
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:23.560
300 plus pounds guy who would hurl grown men through the air.

56
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.420
Only lost once.
Okay.

57
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.750
And the reason why he's only fought Lou rule on gardener wrestled Rulon Gardner

58
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.260
and it was a new rule in Greco Roman where if you lost your grip and then had to

59
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.300
reattach it,
even if there was no dominance,

60
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.600
that guy got a point just cause he made you break your grip.
Oh Wow.

61
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.010
It's the stupidest rule ever.

62
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.650
And it was one that didn't exist through corellas entire reign.

63
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.460
When you want to talk about it.
Fucking so prick athletes,

64
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.820
they used to call him the experiment because his parents were like five,

65
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:52.720
five and five,
seven and he's fucking seven feet tall.

66
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.350
Any normous I mean,
he doesn't even look like a real man.

67
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.390
He looks like some shit from 300 right.

68
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.180
Looks like some shit that the Persians would have with a dog collar on.

69
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.340
I know naked with a fucking giant iron codpiece you know,
running at you.

70
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.370
He didn't rush to training in the snow.

71
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.900
Giant savage just eaten reindeers and shit.
That's the anomaly.

72
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.880
Every once in a while there is,
there is a white guy,
there's,

73
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.150
there's more pure European like that,
but pound for pound in America yet.
But the,

74
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.490
the black race is superior in sports.
Yeah.

75
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.350
But here's the misconception is that you're saying that they're limited to that

76
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.750
and that's not the case at all.
Well,
physically,
you know,

77
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.510
it's also you got to deal with,
it's an economic issue.
People from,

78
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.600
especially when you deal with people that are into like combat sports,

79
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.850
like the combat one,
especially if boxing,
that's a serious economic one.

80
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.290
Very few rich people get it.
Become professional boxers,
right?
It's,

81
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:44.310
it's always like,
it used to be the Jews in New York that was like,
you know,

82
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.900
Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom.
And back in those days,

83
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:51.490
like Jews were a lot of boxers were Jews and then it became a Italians and
Irish,

84
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.940
Puerto Ricans and Irish.
And it was really mostly immigrants that were poor.

85
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:57.650
And then eventually,
you know,
blacks and black athletes.
Right.

86
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.100
But if you look at like greatest athletes of all time,

87
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.620
just only a few like rocky Marciano was in the mix.

88
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.940
A few guys that were like super dominant that were white guys.
Wayne Gretzky.
Yes.

89
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.380
Yeah.
But given a sport that was,
you know,
dominated by whites,
you know,

90
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.880
a Wayne Gretzky,
like look at their attributes.

91
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.500
Wet Gretzky was like very clever and an excellent skater and just,

92
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.950
but like rocky Marciano was known for being just ridiculously durable and,

93
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.940
and just always an incredible shape and would get ahold of you and eventually

94
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.200
wear you down a blast.
You,

95
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.960
so it wasn't like a Muhammad Ali where you couldn't even fuck with them.

96
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.820
Like you were in front of them going,
what am I doing?

97
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.810
Even in the ring with Roy Jones Jr,
right?

98
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.200
You remember when Vinny Pazienza fought Roy Jones?

99
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.830
There was a wound where he didn't land a punch.

100
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.750
It was the only time ever in Compu box history where they had Rick scored entire

101
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.360
round,
100% lopsided.

102
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.980
The other guy didn't land a single punch.
Mexican boy Jones just lit him up.

103
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.370
He was dancing in front of him like a Cobra.
He thought that from down here.
Yeah,

104
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.370
he fought for back here and that jab would come up,

105
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.320
slap you in the face and you're trying to move your big fat head.

106
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.900
You can't get out of the way of it.
Are you that guy fight night,

107
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.220
super ad over over Ali.
I use them in fight now he,
he's the man dude.

108
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.940
He had some ridiculous attributes,
but he had one fuck up.

109
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.950
He developed his technique,

110
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:16.640
technique based and dependent upon his physical attributes.

111
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.780
Instead of going with traditional technique like of like Bernard Hopkins,

112
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.260
Evander Holyfield guys who do everything textbook like James.

113
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.630
Tony does everything textbook.
Instead of doing that,

114
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.760
he went with this big wide open,

115
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.540
loose style that almost completely relied upon his physical attributes.

116
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.110
So when he started to slow down,
they'll start to get fucked up.
You know,

117
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.090
when he fought Tarver he got fucked up,
you know,

118
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:41.000
and that was he coming back from the weight loss because he fought heavyweight

119
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.930
and when you know he got pumped up and then he came from whatever legal or

120
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.060
illegal,
I don't know what the fuck he was doing,
but he got big.
Yeah,

121
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.260
you're going to like over 200 pounds and really muscular,
right?

122
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.570
And then he drops back down to one 70 and you're looking at them and you're
like,

123
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.540
oh,
one 75 and you're like,
okay,
something's hormonally wrong here.

124
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.000
His body looks soft.
You know,
I'm looking at this,
I'm like,

125
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.740
this is a guy who didn't do this correctly.
I bet he jacked his system.
When you,

126
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:05.790
you get on juice,
you Jack Your fucking system.
And then if you get off it,

127
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.850
if you're not doing it correctly,
you get off of it.

128
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:11.320
Your body doesn't bounce back.
You're not producing testosterone,
you know your,

129
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:15.110
your body is shut down because you've made it have all this extra shit in your

130
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:17.210
system.
Your balls are like,
what are we doing?
Let's stop working.

131
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.900
So you have to like bring your balls back to life or something like that.

132
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.480
Like what you're doing.
It's like really radical chemistry.

133
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.380
He clearly wasn't doing that right.

134
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:29.540
And he came back and he looked like really soft and he got tagged and blasted.

135
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.540
It was one of those things when you get blasted once,
man,

136
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.340
it's so much easier to get blasted again.

137
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.590
Cause then Glen Johnson blasted and then it looked really bad at broke.

138
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.020
You're cool.
And that's the thing too,

139
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.230
it's not just that he goes out out unconscious like that.

140
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.940
When the Glen Johnson fight,

141
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.660
he didn't even look like that big of a punch and he went completely unconscious.

142
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.140
One leg up in the air.
I mean he was gone,
which means he's got brain damage.

143
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.560
I mean that's really what it is,
you know?
And so then he like he,

144
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.430
it was all because of his is two things because his body coming back from being

145
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:00.560
big against Diaz at what was that?

146
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.540
No Ruiz big against Ruiz rather John Ruiz and then it was also the those two

147
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:08.750
knockouts.
Man,
if you have knock outs,
ma'am,
you don't,
when people,

148
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:11.030
you know they want to poo poo it like it's no big fucking deal.

149
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.390
You got to bounce back from that thing really slowly and really correctly.

150
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.120
You got to know where your fucking brains out because you might have loose

151
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.110
screws in there.
Oh yeah,

152
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.720
you can be done with it mean you could seriously have serious brain.

153
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:24.340
There's guys that they get knocked out once and then every time they get hit

154
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:26.260
afterwards they're just,
they just go worse.

155
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:30.710
Before he used to have iron chin's I'd grown up watching Mike Tyson all the time

156
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.980
and watching that,
that method of coming out real close to the body,

157
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.230
how he wouldn't just like up there.
It was,

158
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:39.830
it was like the swiftness of like when you see a bear hit somebody in their

159
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:41.660
shoulders popping all that.
But as he got older,

160
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:45.380
it was kind of like a genre specific kind of technique of boxing that there's a

161
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:47.630
little less traditional.
It seemed to,
you know,
like you said,

162
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:49.520
once somebody gets knocked out once buster Douglas,

163
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.800
who shouldn't have got the best of him,
but then once that,

164
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.010
that that's opened up that,
that,
that mess with your psyche and to top it off

165
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.090
<v 1>if you're retarded like him already.
Do you know how tough he was,
man,</v>

166
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.110
the band fucking bombs he took from Holyfield and first fight before he went out

167
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.380
and we got hit with everything.

168
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.400
Dude Holyfield was teeing off on him and he was just taking them in.

169
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:15.480
His legs would buckle up and when he finally went down and he's like searching

170
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:18.180
for his mouthpiece,
you're like,
Holy Shit here.

171
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.920
That's a dude who could take a page and they say,
Oh,

172
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:23.310
you took meetings with this dude took beat buster Douglas one dude.

173
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:27.020
That combination that he blasted Tyson with and Tyson still try and put his

174
00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:30.510
mouthpiece back in.
That mother fucker was game to the end,

175
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.540
blasted out and he's just a scratch scratching around looking for his mouthpiece

176
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.730
to get back in his mouth because he's gonna fuck you up.
Yeah,

177
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.350
he's going to get up and he's gonna fuck you up.

178
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.730
They said that he got knocked out I think one time in a sparring match when he

179
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:47.160
was a kid like 1516 something like that.

180
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:49.850
And like he's one of those boxes that go somewhere in Christ,
you know,

181
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.410
and then it comes back and murders it.
Yeah,
he did that.

182
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:55.260
Apparently he did that to a w who was it?
One of his old guys out.

183
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:55.990
Let's with somebody like that.

184
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.670
He was training with some and the dude got the best of him in a spa and Tyson

185
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:00.061
went somewhere,

186
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:04.050
cried shepard held his knees and that came out and just drop bombs and never

187
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.410
looked back.
So terrifying.
A guy who needs it that much.

188
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.620
A guy who needs it so much is everything about him,

189
00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:15.621
his entire self worth and tire self esteem is just all based on him fucking

190
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:21.621
smashing you just running out and destroying you as a human body to body.

191
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.720
Just imposing his fucking physical will on and they still has that.

192
00:10:26.721 --> 00:10:30.270
That thing about him that I see him on sunset every once in a while and just

193
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:32.970
like,
even if you catch his eyes with you here,
just you know,
it's like,
hey,

194
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.840
hey Mike.
It's like that guy is just a killer bro.
He's a trained killer.

195
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:39.600
He's got the show now.
He's got another pigeon pigeon homing pigeons.

196
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.540
That's what he does,
right?
He like,
like they do in Brooklyn in Puerto Rico.

197
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.190
They home pigeons.

198
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.630
I guess the whole idea is you compete against Mike to really the home you're for

199
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.530
pigeons let him win.
I would always let him play.
He snaps your pigeons.

200
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.940
Next Dude,
I'll let you win.
I'd let him win at everything but,

201
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.750
but I,
I've said it,
I've exceeded it.
I'll take him and Mike Tyson's punch out.

202
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:04.350
I'll knock them out first round.
You mean just punch out and just punch a judge?

203
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:07.980
Just punch out now he has a new game.
I thought he spammed me,

204
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:12.150
but apparently it wasn't spam.
I got a tweet from his account and I was like,

205
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.520
oh my God,
Mike Tyson just fucking spam to me.

206
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:19.080
And I wrote that and Twitter and then uh,
he said it's not spam Joe.

207
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.350
And I'm like,
oh,
the,
the real life.
I think.
Oh Man.

208
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.220
I mean he might be some people that work for us.
Have we said anything bad?
No.

209
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.130
I mean I would never say anything bad.
I'm a huge fan.
Sorry.

210
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.820
Please don't Iron Mike Messiah.
Don't eat my ears.
We Love Mikey.

211
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.500
You want to go back to like ferocious boxers?
All those,

212
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.810
the time when he was a champion and there was no time like that where you like,

213
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:44.100
you were just waiting for this execution.
It wasn't a fight.
It was an execution.

214
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.010
You know when sugar ray Leonard was the baddest motherfucker around and like,

215
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.540
oh shit,
sugary lender,
they're going to have a rematch with Thomas Hearns.

216
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:51.270
You know,
like there's like,
it was exciting,

217
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.170
but you didn't know who was gonna win.
Right.

218
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.680
You knew Mike Tyson was going to victimize somebody on Hbo and you were going to

219
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.540
watch it.
You weren't going to pay 45 bucks or something.

220
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.950
Mike Tyson fight Tony tubs.

221
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:03.040
What the fuck did you think was going to add the fuck?
We know.

222
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:04.120
What's funny is my Granddad,

223
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.930
some old school dude love the Friday night fights and all that and was,

224
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.820
it wasn't with Mike Tyson it at all.
Most grandads were,
and he's like,
man,

225
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.060
he ain't shit.
You know,
talking about that shit.
Right.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

226
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:16.060
Larry Holmes gets a hold of him.
He got a hold of Larry Holmes,
Larry Holmes.

227
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.110
I think he was quoted as saying,

228
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.990
that man hits harder than anything I've ever felt in my life.

229
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:21.550
He was on a totally different level.

230
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:24.520
I would have loved to seen him at his very best against everybody.

231
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.690
Not saying he would have beaten Ali,
but man,
would that have been excited.

232
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.020
You can never say who can do what.

233
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.470
I'm privy to him because I was part of that generation,
you know,

234
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.020
better technical boxers.
You know,

235
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.040
there was better like Lennox Lewis and at his past was a better technical boxer

236
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.540
and he was a hard guy to crack.

237
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.350
He would have been interesting cause when by the time Tyson fought him,

238
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.260
Tyson was already older and you'd already really lost most of his motivation.

239
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:47.951
He just wasn't the same.

240
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:51.400
He was trying to get a pay day and even admitted it after the fight.
But when,

241
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.430
when he was younger,
man that wasn't the case.
When he was younger it was a,

242
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:56.590
it was a totally different animal that would've been,

243
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.720
it would have been interesting to see him at his very best.

244
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.540
Like in the Larry Holmes fight that was at him and his very best,

245
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:04.400
he was to destroy Michael Spinks.
Yeah,
that he was,

246
00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.890
he would have loved to see that Guy Against Ali 21 he was at his,

247
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.730
I wouldn't say the apex of his talent.

248
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.300
It was just that at that w when a customer auto died around then when he had
one,

249
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.520
he hadn't slept yet.
It was flipped yet.

250
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:18.490
And then when custom auto died and you're pretty much in don king's hands,

251
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:21.130
I think that creates,
like now you have the,
you know,

252
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:24.280
one of the greatest athletes that ever lived that he killing machines.

253
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.360
If it's in the wrong hands and it's not fostered right,
it's going to be,

254
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.810
you know,
used the wrong way because I always feel like he's got a great heart.

255
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.930
You know what I mean?
Like he's one of these guys who you can see his emotion,

256
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:38.170
you can see him and he was just always jerked around by the wrong people,

257
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.230
you know?
Well that's definitely going to be the case in,
in,

258
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:43.240
in any situation where you got some powerful fucking kid that can make you a lot

259
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.710
of money.
They're gonna,
you know,

260
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.930
you're going to do whatever they want to do with you and you know,

261
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.050
help you in some ways and support you and you know,

262
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.520
make sure that you make money.
But at the end of the day,
they're just trying to,

263
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.751
trying to push your mic.

264
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:56.320
You mentioned how Conti Robin givens must have been there.
Married,

265
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.660
shut Harvard graduate with Mike Tyson member,

266
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:01.780
that fucking interview they did where she was throwing him under the bus about

267
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:05.320
how crazy he is in the violence and this is on TV and he's just sitting there

268
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.310
like,
Whoa,
what?
Barbara Walters,
right.

269
00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:09.600
And then he's just sitting there just taking the beat.
Ben,

270
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.520
she's going to go out like this.
Yeah,
I could snap her.
I'm the man.

271
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.420
I can't believe all of the things I've done to save her life headed the class.

272
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:17.470
That's the best she had done.

273
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:20.320
He had knocked niggas out left and right and she's going to go in and drag him

274
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.980
under the bus delete.
She was beautiful.
She was,
no,
that's the problem.

275
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:27.260
When you get some beautiful manipulative person,
usually crazy person,

276
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.490
person that really wants to pretend to be something else and then get into your

277
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:34.630
life and then control it.
Like there's some sort of a fucking parasite,
you know,

278
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.500
put a wheel behind your neck and then really that's what she was.

279
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.540
Once you become the little creature in men in black who lives in your brain and

280
00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:43.060
it drives that with joy sticks.

281
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.720
Women want to do that to powerful men is a thing that women want to do to a man

282
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.490
that has some semblance of success,

283
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:52.010
some some power or something where it makes him seem extraordinary.
If

284
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.540
<v 3>she can dominate him with her pussy,</v>

285
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.210
that like robs him of his extraordinary ability.

286
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.810
It takes us cheat like a girl that wants to fuck Francis Ford Coppola,

287
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.550
like to this date as bitches that try to fuck Francis Ford Coppola.

288
00:15:02.551 --> 00:15:03.920
He might be eight years old or whatever.

289
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.510
There's some crazy hot bitch out there whose goth and she's got a fucking tattoo

290
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:12.610
of a bat above her pussy.
She wants to fuck him.
Fuck him.
She's got a chief,

291
00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:16.050
says she siphoning badge and she's ready to take his all his creative.

292
00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:19.240
She loved apocalypse now or was that his movie was right.
Yeah.

293
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.920
She wasn't loved apocalypse now and she wants to suck his dick,
the batcave,

294
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.230
so they're out there.
There's,
there's bitches out there that will ruin your life.

295
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.390
Just like there's dudes that will ruin women's lives.
You know,

296
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.150
it's not even a male female issue.
It's a a retard issue.

297
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.670
It's a broken human issue.
The people,
it's a knowing,
knowing,

298
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:40.520
having children too.
You see this so fucking clearly,

299
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.840
like you have a direct input on how this human being developed.
Very,

300
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.020
very direct.
You know,
it's a,

301
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.600
it's a real clear you to some good things and then they repeat those good things

302
00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:53.040
and you see them hugging little girls and having fun.

303
00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:55.850
You see like there's all this good energy is coming out of your kids and then

304
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:59.370
you see these fucking people that are smoking and yelling at their kid and their

305
00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:02.240
kids beat,
beaten another kid with a stick.
And I'm like,
okay,

306
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.370
kids are little savages.
It's so clear.

307
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:07.640
It's like are what they are is bundles of potential.

308
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.590
But you gotta fucking rain.

309
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.880
The raising a human being and developing a human being is one of the most

310
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:18.410
complex and demanding tasks.
A fucking human being can undertake an end.

311
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:23.330
One of the most important because it literally the quality of the fucking

312
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:28.250
society around it is based on how well the people inside of this group are at

313
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:31.010
raising their children.
That's the number one concern.

314
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.520
If you are terrible at raising your children,
your children will become problems.

315
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:35.690
They're gonna break into cars.

316
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:39.470
They're going to be pains in the asses that had caused crime.
The less of those,

317
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:42.200
the more people that do a good job raising your kids,
the better.

318
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.690
The more people that are moral,
the better.
Or if you're an idiot,

319
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:46.640
at least yield to yourself and say,
I'm an idiot.

320
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.870
I'm going to make my kid not an idiot.
She's like,
how do you want to chat?

321
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.230
You know,
idiots don't know they're idiots,
man.
Almost every idiot thinks scary,

322
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.990
thinks the world's fucking them over and they really should have gotten a better

323
00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:59.780
break.
You know,
whenever you hear that from a person,

324
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:02.150
look at the world fucks everybody over stupid.

325
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.340
Every somewhere along the line your life,

326
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.340
you're going to think you should've got this and it didn't happen and this

327
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:11.800
should want your way.
And it didn't all that poor me shit.
I'm like,
you know what?

328
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.760
Take a look.
What if you lived in Japan?
What if he looked at,
you know,

329
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:15.860
anywhere else where it's soft.
It's like get some perspective.

330
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:18.410
It's like guys will come to you with some stupid shit,

331
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:21.800
like jet amount or can't catch a break,
man.
It was this girl,
you know,
and uh,

332
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.820
I thought she was the one and I was ready to get married and I got the ring and

333
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:29.630
I came over a fucking apartment a day earlier and she's fucking this guy.

334
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.070
I can't fucking believe it bro.
I can't catch a break.
Look,
would you meet?

335
00:17:33.071 --> 00:17:35.330
Can't catch up.
You just got the best break ever.

336
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.140
Are you almost married that crazy hooker,
right?

337
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.880
You were coming over there with a ring and she's sucking some other guy's cock.

338
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.680
You got like clear evidence that she's a skank you.
This is a time machine brow.

339
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.270
You're able to go into the future.

340
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:50.070
See how this would have turned out and can nip it at the bud right

341
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.830
<v 1>here.
When did you sit?</v>

342
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.600
You make yourself attorney's fees and a long lengthy process.
Yeah,

343
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:56.820
you caught an awesome break.
Yeah.
Can't catch a break.

344
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:59.250
You just can't handle your breaks.
It's all a matter of perspective.

345
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.860
I want everything to be perfect,
right?
It's not going to be perfect,

346
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:05.130
but you just caught a huge break.
That guy realistically,

347
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.910
he should shed a couple tears and then start laughing and go,
God damn,

348
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:09.744
I got offline.

349
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.840
Think about what have you had kids with this crazy when you weren't home with

350
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:16.000
kids and their happy meals and mom's sitting on some stuck in some cars,

351
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.500
the living room hoping to get it done quick before her husband comes home,

352
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:22.770
but they don't time it right and you walk in like that's how crazy that pitch
is.

353
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.310
Your kids are watching are sucking off some giant black fucking telephone worker

354
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.490
and then you have to consider this.
You have to consider what you know.

355
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:30.360
You have to consider.

356
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.450
Why are you attracting these kinds of chips into your life to begin with.

357
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.870
You know,

358
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.780
are you that big of a dope that you attracted some kind of trick like that?
Well,

359
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:39.960
sometimes they trick you just by being hot.
That's a real problem with dudes.

360
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:42.220
I don't know if it's the same flood warning curls being high.

361
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.170
It must be the same problem with girls because girls will end up with Jerky
guys.

362
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.700
You know those Jerky guys must just fuck the shit out of him.

363
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.710
That's probably what's going on there.
Like a little,

364
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.230
a little bit of little bit of,
you know,

365
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.910
some sort of a problem and their personality,

366
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:57.930
some sort of a weird disorder where they can't get someone out of their life.

367
00:18:57.931 --> 00:19:01.460
They're the people that have that.
What do they call that?
Like a,

368
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.460
they have some kind of codependency.
Codependent issues.
Yeah.

369
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.140
I mean there's people that have that,
but other than that,

370
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:09.540
you've got to think I was probably fucking shit out of their shells.

371
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.240
It's just like I don't get people who are in these miserable fucking

372
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:13.800
relationships.
It's like I love my girl.

373
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.470
I love her because she's fun to kick it with and I like to hang out with her.

374
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:19.860
You know what I mean?
If I didn't like her,
I'd get rid of her.

375
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.940
I think here's the keys,
number one,
you like yourself,
that's huge.

376
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.300
And the your girl Lex herself too.
So you're,

377
00:19:26.301 --> 00:19:29.290
you're both happy and as happy as you can be.

378
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.610
It's not like everyday we wake up,
it's like,
oh honey,
I love you so much.

379
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.610
I'm just like,
don't even talk to them.
Right.
It's like if you can get,

380
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.840
if two people can live their lives and not break each other's balls,
not,
not,

381
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.410
not create drama,
that kind of thing.
I know that sounds very,
you know,

382
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.840
Nirvana and ideal,
right?
It's possible though,

383
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:48.360
but it is possible because I'm not asking for too much either.

384
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.190
You know what I mean?
You have to be,

385
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.430
you have to be reasonable and you have to be even in like what you expect out of

386
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:55.770
that person and you know how you,
how you deal with them too.

387
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:58.850
It's kind of who I can be.
I can be a real dick.
It's like,
you know,
we're guys,

388
00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:00.810
the girl says something stupid.
You're gonna be a dick back.

389
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.820
Especially like if you're really struggling,

390
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.420
but if you're really trying to put it down and it's hard,
man you,

391
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:08.130
you get that meant that grinding mentality where you're,
you know,

392
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.340
you're always like trying to go,
go,
go get ahead,
get ahead,
get ahead.

393
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.210
And then when someone like trips that up,
I need too much attention,
I need this,

394
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:19.360
I need that.
Like it's very difficult to be considerate,
you know?
It's easy.

395
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.410
Like you shut the fuck up and leave me alone.
I got shit going on here.

396
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.380
And then you start to realize that after a few years that never serves you well

397
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:29.100
because now you've got a six hour fight instead of a two hour fun,
you know,

398
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:31.560
and you are partially to blame.
It's,
you got to step back.

399
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.730
I always try to fix it though.

400
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.950
I always stay in relationships longer because I'm like,

401
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:39.951
you know why Iceland tried to work together with some problem with anything?

402
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:43.110
Like if I was sick down the line,
what did she just going to drop me?

403
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:47.980
Because I'm sick right now.
So I always have that mentality.
So that I've

404
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.280
<v 4>been in relationships where like ice lasted an extra year and a half and it was</v>

405
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:54.400
just trying to fix the relationship.
Sometimes it works.

406
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.350
I mean people have gotten rough,

407
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.960
rough patches and the relationships and they pulled themselves out of it.

408
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.830
But it's like,
what are you accepting though?
How broken is there a person,

409
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.700
you know,
I can't.
And that's the thing,
I'm not in it to fix that other person.

410
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.030
It's like accept that and then I'll,
I'll work on the things like myself.

411
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:10.361
Like I'll,

412
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:14.650
I'll act like my dad sometimes just clam up and beat like a 1950s dickhead dad,

413
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:16.240
you know,
just reading the papers,

414
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.090
smoking and drinking and don't even fucking talk to me,
you know,

415
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:21.850
I'll be like that.
Then I'll have to snap myself out of it cause I'd be like,

416
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.430
all right,
you know,
look at it from her.
So who wants to be with this asshole?

417
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.001
You know?

418
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:29.200
So it's like knowing a little bit about yourself too and working on that.
Plus,

419
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:31.900
we're talking about girls that just learned to drive and like three years ago

420
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.970
and you know,
they,
they,

421
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.030
they're still gonna have a brain that's like trying to learn how life operates

422
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:39.690
it and they'll read,
they'll take it to the mat,
they'll fight you for it.

423
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.920
What do you mean?
Well,
you're talking about girl,
you're dating.

424
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.200
Just graduated or women's.
Brian,
his girlfriend's not 20 years old.

425
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.920
She just turned 27 last Monday.
The Fuck Brian,
that's a woman.
That's my woman.

426
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.840
But I got her when she was 22.
He got her,
I got her.

427
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.780
I found her on my space.
I was trolling for,
for horse.

428
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:01.770
And that one found it found its way in the net.
What's the age difference?
Uh,

429
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.800
four years.
Four,

430
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.440
listen to this fucked up story because Brian was telling me this before the

431
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:06.970
podcast.
So I said,
listen,
stop.

432
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.120
You've got to tell me this during the podcast if you're willing to talk about

433
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:14.620
this.
So he,
he's complaining about his girlfriend,
girlfriend getting harassed.

434
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:18.090
So listen to this.
I think complaining.
I was sort of just saying it.

435
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.840
How funny is this?
Okay.
That,
that she's filming a movie.
And Ron,
Jeremy,
she's,
oh,

436
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:25.150
your girlfriend is a porn star.
Yeah,
but she wasn't,

437
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.130
this isn't a porn that she's feeling.
She's filming a horror movie.
But yeah,

438
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.070
everybody should know.
Uh,
but she's girl,
Girl.
So that only grow up grow.
Yeah.

439
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:38.170
So those are legit.
Uh,
so anyways,
Ron,
Jeremy is there and there,

440
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.650
this has happened with my ex girlfriend where like Ron Jeremy,

441
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:44.380
who also was a porn star.
Yeah.
Ron.
Jeremy came up.
It's like,
Hey,

442
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:46.900
give me a kiss on the mouth,
you know,
and she,
she didn't want a shocking,

443
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.560
you know,
this is crazy.
Uh,
but it's funny the second he walks in he's just like,

444
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.770
oh,
I didn't end of there was going to be any beautiful women there to here.

445
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:55.300
She's telling you all this.
Yeah.
She's,

446
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.460
she thinks she's trying to make you jealous.
No,

447
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:01.120
cause I am the one that asked about it.
I like,
did Ron Jeremy do any creepy shit?

448
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:03.570
And she goes,
well,
no.
Well yeah,
I guess he did.
You know,

449
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.820
I kept on trying to get it out of her.
She didn't just come up and go,
Hey Ron,

450
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:10.360
Jeremy did this.
You say creepy shit.
But that's like standard porn star behave.

451
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.430
What's creepy for him though,
you know?
No,
no,
no,
no.
What's creepy is a like,

452
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:19.000
cause I've seen it in my own eyes.
What he does like with my ex girlfriend,

453
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:22.990
they were cutting a ribbon and event like it was him and her both cutting a

454
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:25.060
ribbon.
She's never met him before.

455
00:23:25.061 --> 00:23:28.600
He's like putting up his arm around her and like rubbing her back and she's
like,

456
00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:31.030
Whoa,
you know what the fuck you know and doing,
you know,

457
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:34.720
just very touchy feely and it's saying like whispering and in ears like you know

458
00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:37.720
everyone wants to see us make out so let's do this.
And she's like,
no,

459
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.260
I'm not going to make out with you.
Why are you hating on his game?

460
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.500
That's what you do when you're running Jeremy.
Yeah,
I know.

461
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:47.240
But you're in your head.
You're to think I'm hating.

462
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.250
I'm just asking what did he do?
Any creepy shit?
Okay.
You were just like,

463
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.560
you weren't upset that he did it.
You expect that.
Not upset at all square,

464
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.310
almost confirming,
hey,
by the way,
we should just say,
you know,

465
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.800
we've labeled her a porn star.
She's very nice person,
you know,

466
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:04.330
whatever the fuck she does for living.
Brian's Brian's girls.
Very nice.
Um,

467
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.090
but you know,
man,
that's fucking,
it's like the Scorpion bite and the frog,
bro.

468
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.520
Oh No,
no.
I'm not saying my nature.
I've just,

469
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:13.790
I just wanted to hear what you would expect him to bring a boner everywhere.

470
00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:17.150
He went and whip it out to like,
Hey,
you guys look boners.

471
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.870
And he prides himself on not using Viagara.
He doesn't give a fuck.
Oh Wow.

472
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.810
Was that,
don't use it.
I don't believe in it.
Yeah.
Fuck an animal.
I can't believe.

473
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:29.180
I couldn't imagine him not doing every venereal disease that's ever existed is

474
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.470
fighting against each other.
To the death inside his belly.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

475
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:38.360
It all just duking it out.
He stays like a bed.
If he takes tests,
he has nothing.

476
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.170
He chose completely clean cause they're all showing each other.

477
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.180
It looks like the battle of Gettysburg,

478
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.210
herpes versus age at no antibodies necessary because the virus is just fight

479
00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:53.600
themselves.
The t cells are on the sidelines laughing.
Yeah.
Everyone's going,

480
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:55.850
Jesus,
this is just an internal warfare.

481
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.910
If someone wins and he's got a real issue because then the host will get

482
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:02.510
attacked.
I guess I feel somewhat comforted to know he would act like that.

483
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:04.280
It's almost like finding out Michael Jordan.

484
00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:06.890
I met Michael Jordan one time and he talked basketball,

485
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.240
any talk that openly and I was very happy about that.
I got to talk basketball.

486
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.020
You know,
you got to talk puss with uh,
with uh,
with a puss Smith essentially.

487
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:17.570
You know,
it's like in Ron Jeremy and it's like,
you know,

488
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:21.650
sometimes you want somebody,
he's,
he's an ambassador of what he does.

489
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:26.000
I think it's fair to say to be an ambassador.
Yeah.
You don't want Ron Jeremy.

490
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:30.290
It'd be fucking doing yoga and drinking wheat grass to be banging hose at every

491
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:34.470
bus stop.
That's what he's doing.
I actually found it awesome.
At the end of here,

492
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.530
right at the end of the shoot,
he comes up and goes,

493
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.190
so if you want to come to the rainbow room later,
I promise not to my list,

494
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:43.760
you or something like that.
You know how many times that got him?
His Dick Sucked.

495
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.350
Oh,
a big tide.
1 million.
There was a year ago,
uh,
there was a,

496
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:48.890
uh,

497
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.220
like a celebrity golf tournament that I think was Bret Michaels or one of those

498
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:53.810
guys once a year.

499
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.710
And every,

500
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.640
every hole there was like a different porn star or stripper or something in my

501
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:04.310
ex girlfriend was working like the,
the eighth hole or whatever,

502
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:05.450
this golf tournament.

503
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.230
And there was these two girls with them that were just total like porn stars,

504
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:09.651
like heart,

505
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:13.400
like amateur strippers slash porn starts flash escorts or whatever the fuck show

506
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:16.310
you,
whatever.
That unfortunate in tattoos.
They saw Ron,

507
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:19.820
Jeremy and the one girl just turned and guys,
I'm like,
I got to suck his dick.

508
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:22.830
And just went right over to Ron and they just started pulling down their pants

509
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:24.800
and sucking his dick right on the golf,
the golf course.

510
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.070
My girlfriend at the time's just taking video,
like look at this,
the city,

511
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.250
he had sex with her on the golf course.
I they just blow job.
But yeah,

512
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.070
last time you told me the story you told him that.
I don't even remember.

513
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.240
I thought it was fine.
I just,
I just thought it was supplemented your stories.

514
00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.700
I want to say sex if it didn't have,

515
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.530
I knew that bloaty show you last time you told me he bent over and he was

516
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:45.720
banging her right there on the golf course and that's what happened.

517
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.950
But I remember a blowjob.
I don't either way.
That's pretty Ron.
Jeremy Being Ron.

518
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:52.980
Jeremy,
yeah,
I think it's sweet.
I think that's exactly what he has to be,

519
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:56.220
but it's just hilarious to me that,
does it seem weird to like,

520
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.400
what is it like dating some chick that you know all these other dudes can see

521
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:00.600
your pussy and she's going to,

522
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.880
I don't give a shit about that was in there and stuff.

523
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.820
I don't care about that as well.
It doesn't bother me at all.
What is it?

524
00:27:05.821 --> 00:27:08.950
What does she,
has she been in a lot of things?
Like is it exciting?
I,

525
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.833
I'm an exciting,

526
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.280
there's something extra thrilling and it's kind of cool because like I am,

527
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.440
I love porn.
I love,
I love women,
women's bodies.

528
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.830
Cause she has a nice body.
It's not like I'm like,
yeah,

529
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:22.940
you guys can't see this to me it's like,
dude,
check this shit out.

530
00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:25.890
Like people really damn it.
Celebrate porn and like know certain.

531
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:30.030
Like I've always,
I,
I love sex big time.
I just have a pretty good imagination.

532
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:33.630
I can get one out over something from eighth grade that I remember.
Right.

533
00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:36.660
You know,
and in porn is always been like fishing to me.
I love fishing,

534
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:40.570
but I'm not that into watching it.
I'd rather be doing it.
Right.
You know?
Um,

535
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.520
but it seems now that,
that,
that porn has taken on a real,
like there's,
there,

536
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:46.620
there are actually are more than one star.
It's like,

537
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:50.950
it seems like people really make names for themselves.
She in that,
yeah.
Yeah.

538
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.960
That kind of known the circle.
Yeah.
She's a,
she's an award winner.

539
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.940
It's becoming more chasing little awards

540
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.320
and award winner eyebrows raised.
She's an award winner.

541
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.860
When the grab your ankles award,
you know what the biggest difference is Joe is,

542
00:28:05.861 --> 00:28:08.830
is that if,
uh,
if I didn't meet her,
uh,

543
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.150
as a normal person and then she got into porn,
that would have been hardcore.

544
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.340
Oh yeah.
You'd have to deal with that.

545
00:28:14.341 --> 00:28:16.990
Like if my girlfriend just one day just like,
hey,
I went start doing porn.
Ebay.

546
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.130
Oh,
right.
I see what you're saying.
So you expect her as she is,

547
00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:22.440
when you met somebody who is already opened up Pandora's box,

548
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:24.630
you don't want to help her.
Oh dude,
this is a crazy world.

549
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:28.080
It doesn't have to make sense.
It just whatever you liked.
If you like it,

550
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.470
that's good you guys only together.
That's great.
There's no worries.

551
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.930
All that bullshit about,
you know,

552
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.250
worrying what other people think and other people's judgments.

553
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.660
It ain't going to last people.
The shit is temporary.
Temporary is fuck you.

554
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.650
Every body is slowly going to give out on you and you're going to be left with a

555
00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:47.550
wreck of a life trying to fucking look back on it going,
why didn't I enjoy this?

556
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.960
I do not just have some fun and that's why none of it matters.
It's all a joke.

557
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.850
It's all a joke.
It's all fun.
Yeah.
If you choose to go in that direction.

558
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:02.150
If I had a Bam like a sweet by like if I worked on my body hard for like if I

559
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:06.790
was rocking Joe Rogan's body right here cause it's sweet,
I would totally be,

560
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.720
I would not give a shit.
I'll be starting my dick nonstop.
I would warn.

561
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.780
I would be doing whatever.
Who Cares?

562
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.650
But it's like I don't want to be the fucking Minyon.
I don't want to be like that

563
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.230
chicken my end and to,

564
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.270
these are the folks who don't know what you're talking about.

565
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:23.880
There's a website where a guy,
and we've talked about on the podcast for,

566
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:25.950
it's really ugly when he fucks all these hot chicks.

567
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.430
He's ugly and fat and he calls himself the minion.
What's his game?

568
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.540
It's just the numbers game.
Oh,
is he a pouring again?
He just pay him.

569
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.240
They'll fuck you.
You know what I mean?
You ever seen those a amateur ones?

570
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.730
There was a girl from Arizona state that got busted.

571
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:41.410
She got kicked out of school because they think,
I don't know.

572
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:42.100
I guess they have some

573
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 1>sort of a fucking morals clause.
You know a lot to do porn at Asu.
Yeah,</v>

574
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:48.910
whatever it was.
I mean,
maybe,
maybe I'm reading it wrong.

575
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.820
Maybe she got fired from a job there.
I don't think so though.

576
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:55.300
I'm pretty sure she was a student there in any ways or maybe she lost her.

577
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.710
What the fuck is a story is anyway,
this poor girl,
you know,
she's just dumbed.

578
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:00.940
She got tricked next.

579
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.970
He knows she's doing porn and they put it up on the Internet and all her fucking

580
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:06.790
friends in school like,
oh my God,
Debbie sucking this guy's Dick.

581
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:09.640
And you know he did.
It doesn't matter what the guy looks like,

582
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.120
they just have this setup.
This is a lot of them.
The girl comes in,

583
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.810
there's cameras.
This is like most,
a lot of people's favorite,

584
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.480
favorite type of porns.
What does is like voyeurism?
It's like,
well it's,

585
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:21.460
it's like an interview porn.
This is what it is.

586
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.550
There's a guy in the room and you,
you see it from his perspective.

587
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.900
You don't see him ever.

588
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.050
So he's got like the camera on the girl walks in the room and then he starts

589
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:33.070
asking her questions while you from how old I am.
Have you ever done this before?

590
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.730
Now you know,
you know,
we hear for yeah.
And then,
you know,

591
00:30:35.731 --> 00:30:38.770
ask them a bunch of questions.
Where'd you grow up?
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

592
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.500
you know,
and you married,
do you have any kids?
The whole deal.

593
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.970
Then you have to suck some cock.
Yeah.
And then you,

594
00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.660
you know the car,

595
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.330
the Guy Pulls his dick out in the girl starts sucking thing and you can see

596
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:54.331
there's like this weird fucking energy in the air because they both know that

597
00:30:54.851 --> 00:30:57.190
they're doing this and it's going to get online.
Right.

598
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.300
You're going to do this online.
I mean,

599
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:01.570
they're not really porn stars him and he's not really a porn star and she's just

600
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:03.970
some chick who's getting talked into doing this.
I mean,
you know,

601
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.040
they haven't gone to vivid and worked on,

602
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.900
you're talking about casting couches or,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No.

603
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.570
Some of them are fake.
They,
some of,

604
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.880
they can't film it unless they have already done a drug test or if they've

605
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:17.230
already signed up their papers like it,

606
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:20.740
they'd every part of the country at least most at least United.

607
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:23.200
I mean it's probably thinking,
oh I bet that's the rules,

608
00:31:23.201 --> 00:31:25.760
but I'm sure there's people out there gorilla and are pretty hardcore about it.

609
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.510
They are pretty hardcore about it.
What do you mean though?

610
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.250
I mean if a girl's sucks,
that guy's Dick on video.
They have to get a of it.

611
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:37.090
She has to get a drug test or tests in the whole country and the whole kind of

612
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:39.320
tell you positive about this.
Pretty positive.
I'm not,

613
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.560
we should restrict the least.
Okay,

614
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:44.500
let's not talk about that until we figure this out because this is a silly

615
00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:47.830
conversation then because that's,
that's the main crux of the issue,
right?
I mean,

616
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:51.700
I know a lot of them are fake,
but a lot of them,
like this girl from Asu,

617
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.130
this Barabbas,
perfect example that's fake,

618
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.780
but we'll run with those are porn stars,
right?

619
00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.380
They're not just porn starts right there at the whole,
like the whole thing.

620
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.170
The whole thing has been set up,
all of that one,
but not all of them.
Right.

621
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.690
These gorilla ones where you don't even see the guy's face.
Do you have,

622
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:06.310
there's gotta be sound.
There's a lot of ground.

623
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:10.810
If it's on a website that's making money and it's a legit website.
Okay.
Yes,

624
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:14.060
it's fake.
Where would we find this out?
Uh,
I don't know.

625
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.490
Make it rules will make a phone call.
Porn rules.

626
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.540
What would you Google
butthole,
California.

627
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.340
A STD test rules for taking loads on face,
on camera film,

628
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.810
Porn Law?
No,
Brian,
this is not true.

629
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.220
Porn stars could see mandatory STD testing.
Could see.

630
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.920
They do not have them right now.
What's the date on it is not Matt.

631
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.280
Matt May 11th or March,
excuse me,
March 21st,

632
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.980
2011 30 reshare about that.
I'm reading it right now,
Bro.

633
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.050
On the La Weekly Porn Stars in California with see stricter safety rules on how

634
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:54.620
they do their thing on set.
Just like construction worker has to wear a hard hat.

635
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:57.710
They might have to do dawn condoms and submit to tests.

636
00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.180
They're saying they don't have mandatory tests yet.
From my understanding,

637
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:04.290
it's 30 been mandatory.
I don't really,
yeah.

638
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.800
Why are they saying this in la weekly then,
Bro?

639
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.710
This bitch is it telling you they're getting tested and you're just

640
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.910
fucking living off those tests?
I'm like,
oh cool.

641
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:16.220
I don't have aids again this week,
but la weekly's free.

642
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:19.810
They don't have any reason to lie to me.
Yeah.
I don't think la was lying.
Oh,

643
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.060
I know that.
That,
that what's been lately as the condom laws where they're,

644
00:33:24.061 --> 00:33:25.880
they're trying to make it so I think they've already made,

645
00:33:25.881 --> 00:33:28.460
it's not mandatory bro.
Here's the deal.
In porn world in la,

646
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.380
they already test their performance regularly,

647
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.950
but that hasn't stopped diseases including HIV positive scandal for one gay

648
00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:38.630
performer last year.
Yeah.
It apparently it's not.
They do it,
they do it a lot,

649
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.610
but it doesn't seem to be like a law.
So the girl at Esu sounds real though.

650
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:47.450
I think some of my,
it is real.
I'm sure some of the followers are from Asu.
Uh,

651
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.630
I think there's an Asu Mckinsey followed me to find out that Asu,

652
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.400
there's been a few guys that are posted on our board that were,
were porn guys.

653
00:33:55.430 --> 00:34:00.290
One of them,
man,
it was did just real ACC humiliation porn.
He would like,

654
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:04.010
it was really kind of depressing who would tell the stories about how he wrote

655
00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:05.720
these chicks in and how like,
you know,

656
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.910
a lot of them were like single moms and they needed,

657
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.060
they needed money for the rent and how he will hook it up.

658
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:13.820
And the next thing you know they would be doing like Internet porn forum.

659
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.510
It's really crazy.
Yeah.
I mean I would imagine everybody recruiting,

660
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:18.410
especially for the Internet porn,

661
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:20.290
it's going to be sleazy cause you're going to go after who's weak.

662
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.150
It's just like a,
you know a military recruiters going to go after it.

663
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.330
A 17 year old.
I just combined two stories.
Again,

664
00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:32.000
the guy who was the bringing in the women and and getting in,

665
00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:34.370
paying for the rent and shit like that.
That wasn't a porn guy.

666
00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:37.520
He was a guy who used to write stories about it and he had a website about it.

667
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.510
I completely confused it.
The porn guys,
that's a different story.

668
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.670
Damn.
Hey,
want to do that?

669
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.360
The stories that you really never thought about for years and there's somewhere

670
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:49.640
in the back of your head.
Then you combine them together and you're like,

671
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:52.910
wait a minute,
you guys stop moving.
Stay still.

672
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.420
What are you doing wearing his clothes?
You can get over there.

673
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.860
You know you fuckers,
you tricked me there for a second.

674
00:34:57.861 --> 00:35:00.800
Let's say I get that all the time.
Or You just simply thought you made it up?

675
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:01.634
I thought I'd made,

676
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.020
I remember in fifth grade we buried a time capsule and our school and I was

677
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.050
driving the other day and I was like,
Holy Shit,
we bear to fucking time capsule.

678
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.980
It was a 89 I was like,
I wonder,
I wonder if they dug it up.

679
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:16.100
So I emailed the school that I went to back in 89 I was like,
Hey,

680
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.220
my name's pretty lock our,
yeah,
I said,
my name is Freddy Lockhart,

681
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.590
you know I went to school there in [inaudible] 89 I'm curious,

682
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:23.870
we buried a time capsule.
Did you guys find it?
And she's like,

683
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:28.160
funny enough we did a,
you know,
unearth it and a,
it had some water damage,

684
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:30.770
but in my mind I thought we stuck like a game boy in there.

685
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:34.490
I think what I'm doing,
it's just associating all things.
1989 we shoved in there,

686
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.040
but in 1989 I don't think any kid on earth would their fucking game

687
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.230
<v 4>boy for a capsule,
a time capsule.</v>

688
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:44.100
So I think it just was was like pictures and prices of candy bars and shit,

689
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.720
but I was just so compelled by just that memory popping in my head.

690
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.750
I got with that lady and it sounds like she's probably been there this whole

691
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:52.590
time too.
She's like,

692
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:56.070
it's always nice to hear from former students and yes we did dig it up.

693
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.320
I was like,
bitch,
what was the treasure in there or what?

694
00:35:58.321 --> 00:36:01.200
And turns out just papers and shit.
No game boy.

695
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.260
I thought for sure I had a game boy in there.

696
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.170
It was just papers like like you know like newspapers and things of the day,

697
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.270
but to me it's like I,
I'm more impressed.

698
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:12.840
Like I wanted to see since of the technological revolution has gone leaps and

699
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:16.140
bounds since 1989 to now.
That's what we should have put in there.
It's like,

700
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:16.381
you know,

701
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:19.530
some outdated shit so we can laugh at it now if you ever thought about like

702
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:22.620
buying one of those off of like Amazon or Ebay or something like that,

703
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:24.690
just to see what it's like to play with it now.
What's that?

704
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.000
Some old gas game boy.
Oh,
I have all the elegance.

705
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.330
All the boxes.
I have all the storage.

706
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.980
Why do you think my office is so credible?

707
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.130
I have an old and a 10 I was telling him earlier,
there's a,

708
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.210
there's a show on Justin TV.
This guy,

709
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.780
this guy called the angry game or you've seen it?
Yeah,
it's fun.

710
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.710
This guy's fucking hilarious.
He says nerd.

711
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:46.530
I guess he's like in his early thirties but he reviews old video games.

712
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:47.251
It's his whole job.

713
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:50.460
He's got this whole basement Nintendo games as far as the eyes can see.

714
00:36:50.461 --> 00:36:53.040
Sega Genesis Games,
you name it,
he'll review it,

715
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:56.130
but as an adult and intellectual adult who curses like a sailor,

716
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.670
he'll review the game and it'll take you back to when you're nine years old and

717
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:02.760
you were playing rag or something.
You like,
how the fuck do I jump over here?

718
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.900
He uncovers glitches and he,
and he shows you that I was right.

719
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:09.450
There wasn't a way to do that the whole time,
but I got to watch him.

720
00:37:09.451 --> 00:37:12.840
This dude shit like nine episodes.
He just pissed about everything.
He's like,
no,

721
00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:16.020
I'll play it on the original game.
Boy,
game fucking sucks.

722
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.190
He never likes anything but he voices your frustrations as a nine year old is an

723
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:24.800
adult.
That's so weird,
I think.
What is it,
the angry Gamer Gamer or if I remember.

724
00:37:24.801 --> 00:37:29.370
Yeah,
fucking hilarious.
Reviewing old shit.
It's retro VI reviews though,

725
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.660
but that's cool.
Shit.
You know,

726
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.780
especially to go back and really review something from an adult perspective.

727
00:37:33.781 --> 00:37:36.120
I thought it was just a dumb kid.
I was like,
I can't figure it out.

728
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:39.660
It doesn't work,
you know?
But now I realize I was a dumb kid,

729
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:43.290
but there was a click.
She as well.
Yeah.
You know,
fucking retro gaming.

730
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:46.260
It's pretty amazing.
I,
I bought something the other day on my iPad.
I'm like,

731
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:48.570
you know,
what is it like an old classic game?
And I was like,

732
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:52.040
I think this is probably the sixth time I've bought this game.
Oh yeah.

733
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.280
Like PAC man.
I've bought PAC man at least 20 times in my life.

734
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.910
Who knows how many quarters spent on an arcade version to imagine trying to

735
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:03.720
explain video games with someone in the Middle Ages.
I know it was.

736
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:07.500
Where do you even start?
Okay.
You know what,
eight bits are right.

737
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.250
You know how you draw pictures.
Now imagine that moving trolling,

738
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:15.860
you control it with a mouse keyboard.
Yeah.

739
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.250
Imagine trying to explain how to work an iPhone to somebody 10 years ago and I

740
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:23.040
think it's squinting now.
I don't want to right touch screen.
Yeah.

741
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.250
There was an episode of the show journeyman's.
You guys ever see that show?

742
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.270
Shortlived time traveling series on ABC journeymen.

743
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.270
I think it was like 2007 and it was really fucking good.
Of course,

744
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:35.500
I'm a time travel nerd so I was probably the only one it,

745
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.230
but he goes back to like 1981 and he gets shot.

746
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.450
He has to go seek medical attention at the hospital.

747
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.590
They find his iPhone laying on his chest and this doctor is like,
what the fuck?

748
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.290
Like scrolling through it and I loved that Shit just to see.

749
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.200
That's what I would time travels to go blow people's minds with shit.
Yeah.

750
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:53.470
If you showed someone a,
an iPhone just 20 years ago,
they would really,

751
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.480
really fucking freak out.
Spritz,

752
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:59.500
amazing how you could touch the screen and it knows like where your finger

753
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:03.310
touches,
like for letters and shit like that.
It's amazing how accurate that is.

754
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:04.720
But you know how long this shit's been out.

755
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:09.160
They'll go look like the first touchscreen phone was like sprint or somebody put

756
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:13.930
one out in 1992 and it was a,
it's an all touch screen,
like holler phone.
It was,

757
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:17.290
of course it was like 2000 bucks.
Like Google first.
Uh,

758
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.690
do you remember the Newton Newton?
Sure.
I remember that stupid path.
First IPAD,

759
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.030
my very first development deal.

760
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:29.860
I came over here and this guy who was just being executive at Disney had one and

761
00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:32.920
he was,
it was showing us all in the office and we were like,
Whoa,

762
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:35.020
what the fuck is that?
And he's like,
this is a Newton.

763
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.140
I didn't know what that was.
Wow.

764
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.480
This is like 93 94 somewhere around then.
Yeah,
they did.

765
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.600
I'm 92 93 94 at the end.
You could email from them to,

766
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.650
you can fax email and all that.
That's incredible.
When I was PC only.

767
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.880
That's so back in the day,
man.
It really is.
It's,
it's,

768
00:39:53.881 --> 00:39:57.360
it's funny when you think about it,
but it's like all that stuff.
It was they,

769
00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:58.570
they knew they wanted to do that shit.

770
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:01.360
What I want to do is go blow Steve Jobs is mine and show him to shit.

771
00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:05.110
He's gonna invent,
but show him when he's 20 yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
No kidding.

772
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.440
Look what you're going to come up with.
Yeah,
he would.
Well,

773
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:11.440
you'd probably ruined it all.
Yeah,
you would.
You'd fuck up everything in time.

774
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.060
If he knew that he was going to be that successful,

775
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:15.480
maybe it wouldn't work as hard.
Oh,
so in that journey,
men,

776
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.200
what happened is he leaves his iPhone back there and nano technology is now sped

777
00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:22.630
up 30 years because he left it back in the past.

778
00:40:22.631 --> 00:40:26.500
So he gets back to his profile and nanotechnology rules the world.

779
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.700
There's just nothing but like,
what does this journeymen,

780
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.090
it's called a journeymen.
It was a one season on ABC.
Fucking fantastic.
Really.

781
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.970
It's on Hulu.
You can catch all the episodes on Hulu and it just,

782
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.570
it got canceled or that canceled,
you know,
it is big budget time travel.

783
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.870
Small brains don't pick up,
you know,
journeymen and never even heard of it.
Yeah,

784
00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:46.390
it was a short,
it's really good.
It was really good.

785
00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:49.330
It was done in the way that you wanted it to be done.
Time travel.

786
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:51.280
Like they really hit the things I wanted to see.

787
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.100
Did they end it like they knew they were ending it or do they just end it out of

788
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:57.220
the blue?
It seems like they ended it out of the blue.

789
00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.060
It was probably one of those things.

790
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:00.520
We went Christmas break and so it just comes up in the air.

791
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.480
It's over kids I was at at target the other day fucking just looking at cameras

792
00:41:04.481 --> 00:41:06.680
cause it's like my little digital camera think broke.

793
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:09.450
And so I'm trying to find like a little small camera and uh,
I,

794
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:12.820
all the cameras were out of stock and because of the Japan thing.

795
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:17.320
And then I read the other day that the new iPhone is now rumored to be in

796
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:21.250
September instead of June.
Maybe because of the Japan thing.
I'm not sure that,

797
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.260
I'm just amazed like how much fucking shit has affected,
you know,

798
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:30.820
doesn't say nothing.
Yeah.
That's a tiny thing.

799
00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.440
That's a tiny thing.
The real issue is this,
the radiations

800
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.730
<v 3>coming out of there now,
man,
livable now.
Do you think it's,</v>

801
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.440
well they've jacked it up to turnover levels seven there.
Yeah,
there that's,

802
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.460
you know,
they didn't think it was going to get that bad.

803
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.910
They said it's still not as bad as turnover because it's more contained and

804
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:50.630
Chernobyl had ash fires that burned for days and spread the shit spread the

805
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:54.710
radioactive material.
So,
but it's problematic,
man.
It's a big,

806
00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:57.880
big issue and they don't know how much worse it's going to get and it's going to

807
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.680
keep getting earthquakes there too.
They had another one the other day.
Yeah,

808
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.070
a strong seven.
It never gets better.
Right.
Radiation,

809
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:07.370
you can't say it's always going to be there.
Right.
Dead Layer.

810
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:11.900
A hundred thousand years.
It's,
it'll be fucked up for so long.

811
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.660
Fucking Asians are going to actually have tentacles coming out of them at the

812
00:42:14.661 --> 00:42:16.220
idea that we have this,
I mean,

813
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:20.420
nuclear power is one of the all time craziest ideas and everybody was like

814
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:22.190
nuclear power seats.
It's one of these things.

815
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:25.700
He's fucking tie wearing Republican cunt bags.

816
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.240
These assholes that are always like,
hey,
what's the alarm?
What we'll do?

817
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.900
You alarmists these liberals.
Swana listen,

818
00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:36.830
there's nothing wrong with nuclear power.
Nuclear power is clean.

819
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.000
It's safe like outside of three mile island and Chernobyl.

820
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.660
Where's the problems?
We've had nuclear power for 30 years.

821
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:49.460
30 years is a goddamn blink of an eye.
It's this,
it's nothing.

822
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.800
If human beings are going to exist in the future,

823
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:53.330
thousands and thousands of years from now,

824
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:57.920
what are we going to keep piling up these fucking toxic rods until we have one

825
00:42:57.921 --> 00:42:58.754
part of the globe.

826
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.960
Globe where you couldn't even fly over it in a plane or you're fucking plane

827
00:43:01.961 --> 00:43:04.790
will melt and everyone would die of cancer.
The fuck you gonna do?

828
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.970
How are you going to store all that shit?
I mean they did this thing in Sweden.

829
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.140
I think it is.
Whether it's they have a tunnel,

830
00:43:10.141 --> 00:43:12.990
it's like goes deep into the earth in this vault.
They created that.

831
00:43:12.991 --> 00:43:17.060
It lasts a hundred thousand years just to keep these fucking things in it.
She's,

832
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.021
that's ridiculous.

833
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:21.490
I mean the idea of splitting atoms to light homes though and harnessing it and

834
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.650
their man think that we can control splitting out.
It was like,
oh,

835
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:26.690
but what's the options?
You look at the grid,

836
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.770
look at like fly over la and look at the size of that fucking grid.

837
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:35.860
Look at all those goddamn lights.
Look at all those houses.
Look at it.

838
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.040
It's insane how big it is.

839
00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:41.120
Don't you think it should be mandatory solar collector roofs or something like

840
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:44.180
that?
Should be fucking for California.
A hundred percent man for,

841
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.280
well it's the problem is it's really expensive.

842
00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.250
You know people can barely afford to put gas in our tank right now.

843
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.450
I mean now gas is four 24 regular.
I saw that yesterday.
I was like,

844
00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:58.400
what the fuck is that for 20 for regular?
I'm like,

845
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:02.060
that's incredible.
90 bucks filling my tank the other day too.
That's,

846
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.180
that's wrong.
What do you drive?
You know,
Ford Edge,

847
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:09.170
these fucking cunts that we have run in this country,
man,
there was a,

848
00:44:09.171 --> 00:44:13.920
there was a story that Matt Taibbi wrote for Rolling Stone about the,
uh,

849
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.750
I put it on my Twitter earlier today because somebody,

850
00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:22.340
somebody retweeted it or somebody sent it to me and I retweeted it and it is

851
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.400
mind boggling and it's all about the wives of bankers getting these,

852
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:31.380
uh,
it's,
the rolling stone article is called the real housewives,
a Wall Street.

853
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.680
And it's about these wives of these fucking bankers getting these $250 million

854
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.260
loans.
It's incredible.
This,
this,

855
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.690
the story will make your fucking blood boil.

856
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.950
They've tapped into the money that was supposed to be a for the bailout and the

857
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:50.640
bailout provided a bunch of different loan options and it was basically to,
to,

858
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:52.020
to re stimulate the economy.

859
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:56.920
These fucking multi-multi multimillionaire bankers saw this opening in the

860
00:44:56.921 --> 00:45:01.590
system and capitalized on it.
Dude,
it's terrifying.
And the way these,
these,

861
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.950
these bonds and these,
uh,
these things work is a,

862
00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:08.340
they buy up sketchy bonds and if the bonds fail,
if everything fails,

863
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.430
they don't have to pay the money back.
But if the profit,

864
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:15.390
they make money off of it and we got the whole thing,
it's mind boggling.
It's,

865
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.040
it's so scary.

866
00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.590
<v 4>It's crazy.
I mean,
it's like,
it's not admirable.</v>

867
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:22.230
That's almost crazy how you see the second son comes,

868
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:24.210
somebody finds a way to exploit it.
You know what I mean?

869
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:29.211
Somebody find some loophole in there in shame on Obama's entire administration

870
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:32.890
and Bushes,
all these curtains for not putting some literature in,

871
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.990
in that document saying that you cannot,
you know,
no,
nope.

872
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.900
No profits should be made off this,
you know,

873
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.410
from the bankers or the pancreas wives,
250 million.

874
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.870
<v 3>Well that's,
that's one thing,
but how about there should be no fucking did.</v>

875
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.650
The bailout is the way they've structured it is completely insane.

876
00:45:47.651 --> 00:45:50.350
It's like free money.
There's no accountability.

877
00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:53.500
They can can't account for the money.
We're not getting receipts either.

878
00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:57.370
When it's not like the United States citizens have paid the taxes towards this,

879
00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.460
get to review where the money went.
So there's more like an an account of it.

880
00:46:00.461 --> 00:46:03.150
So you can watch it and track it.
No,
you can't man.

881
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.220
They don't know where the fuck it's going.
It's the whole thing is complete,

882
00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.520
utter chaos and it's completely out of line.

883
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.580
These people are getting giant bonuses,
man,
they're,

884
00:46:12.581 --> 00:46:15.050
they're banks failed and they got bonus.
So they get,

885
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.770
but they get to the rich get richer and the money comes directly from the

886
00:46:17.771 --> 00:46:20.650
taxpayer.
There is no money.
The bank has failed.
They don't have any money.

887
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.960
So they get an infusion of money from the federal government and then they have

888
00:46:22.961 --> 00:46:24.130
to pay these guys money.

889
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.120
These guys millions and millions of dollars and it's amazing that Obama gets

890
00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:30.100
away with this,
but all of them get away with this.

891
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.190
You are supposed to be the fucking president.
You asshole.

892
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.190
You're supposed to be protecting people from this shit.
We're not.

893
00:46:36.191 --> 00:46:39.040
This is not supposed to have ever happened.
And when this does happen,

894
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.020
you're the one who's supposed to be us.

895
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.860
You're the one who's supposed to step in and say,
what the fuck man,
you're Obama,

896
00:46:44.861 --> 00:46:48.280
you're,
you're 46 years old,
man.
You're only a few years older than me.

897
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.860
You're a few years old and you're,
you're my friend.

898
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.950
You're in there with these fucking constant,
you're not saying it's shit.

899
00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.870
You letting these guys steal money.

900
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.710
You're letting him steal billions and crushed the economy and continue to do

901
00:46:59.711 --> 00:47:00.521
business as usual.

902
00:47:00.521 --> 00:47:03.550
And the banks get bigger and bigger because they fucking buy up these other

903
00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:06.910
failing banks and then they become even more untouchable in American cities.

904
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:10.360
But decay like Detroit and what they helped you get in power.

905
00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:11.770
So that's what's up.
Like what is his name?

906
00:47:11.771 --> 00:47:14.290
Are you going to wait when you get out or you're going to tell us what's up?

907
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.161
What happens then?

908
00:47:15.161 --> 00:47:18.640
Is he going to get maybe loses this year Newt Gingrich twins and he tells us

909
00:47:18.641 --> 00:47:22.510
exactly how the fucking world works,
you know,
like that.
Is that going to happen?

910
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.393
The please?

911
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:24.350
<v 4>Got It.</v>

912
00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:29.350
And just like any other aspiring man of anybody running for president,

913
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:31.510
I don't really think it's been since Kennedy or someone like that,

914
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:35.860
who's really in it for political reasons and,
and even Kennedy was born for it,

915
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.200
you know,
he was groomed for it.
He was of the pedigree.

916
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.490
But the thing is like I now,
it's a corporate,
it's a CEO job.
You're not,
you're,

917
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:45.400
you're,
you're,
you're the top of the company now.
You're not,
like you said,

918
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:47.470
a man of the people for the people,
by the people.

919
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.320
And he might've gone into that thing thinking he could be,

920
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.800
but once you sit down and they sit you in that room,
look,
boy,
you're the puppet.

921
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.770
<v 3>Do you think that's true though?
Or do you think it's just all bullshit?</v>

922
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.300
<v 4>He has any power and I don't think it's any worse than it's ever been ever.</v>

923
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.270
I think,
I think everybody,
it gets up in arms.
It's like,
look at Nixon,

924
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.910
look at all those guys.
Everybody was,

925
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.780
how could you not be president and start to develop some grandiose ideas.

926
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:13.790
<v 3>Yeah,
but dude,
you gotta it's financially,
it's never been this way.</v>

927
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.820
It's never been with the deregulation that was passed during the Reagan

928
00:48:16.821 --> 00:48:20.000
administration and continued all through Clinton and Bush and all this,

929
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.020
that is allowed these financial institutions to get into a position that we were

930
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:27.350
supposed to be protected from after the Great Depression,

931
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:28.790
after the Great Depression,

932
00:48:28.791 --> 00:48:32.120
they put all sorts of laws in place so that banks couldn't get risky with your

933
00:48:32.121 --> 00:48:35.570
money and do crazy shit and then wind up losing everything right,
which they did.

934
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.280
They got rid of all that shit.

935
00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:41.180
They get rid of all that shit and then unchecked growth and spending came

936
00:48:41.181 --> 00:48:42.290
because of that and these guys,

937
00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:45.800
these motherfuckers took all kinds of crazy chances with people's money and then

938
00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:48.860
it all fell apart and then banks collapsed and people lost their life savings.

939
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.820
<v 4>What's happening?
It's happening too,
like you look now,</v>

940
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:54.770
the cell phone companies are narrowing down to two.
There's virtually two banks.

941
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.870
<v 3>That's not that bad though.
No one's getting ripped off this,
this,</v>

942
00:48:57.871 --> 00:48:59.630
this financial institution.
They went,

943
00:48:59.631 --> 00:49:04.080
what happened with the market is a goddamn heist.
It's a giant heist.

944
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:08.040
People made millions of dollars in front of everyone's face after the banks

945
00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:13.020
failed and Obama didn't do a damn thing.
It's a heist saw it.

946
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.770
He knows it.
It went on in the 80s to the Lincoln savings and loan scandal,

947
00:49:16.771 --> 00:49:20.040
and he never liked this.
This is the biggest one by far,

948
00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:23.080
ever that's ever been perpetrated by these people like fraud.

949
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.490
The whole thing is fraudulent.
The whole thing is a scam.
The,

950
00:49:26.491 --> 00:49:30.930
from the very beginning,
they,
they knew everything was illegitimate.

951
00:49:30.931 --> 00:49:35.040
They knew what they were doing was wrong.
They were trying to offering clients,

952
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.730
uh,
luck stocks that they knew that they were betting against.

953
00:49:38.731 --> 00:49:40.170
They were betting against these stocks and get there.

954
00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:42.740
We're offering up to their clients.
The whole thing is sickening,
man.

955
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.900
It's sickening.
And Obama ain't doing shit.
He's not saying anything.

956
00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:48.450
He's not doing anything.
He's not freaking out.
It's sick.

957
00:49:48.451 --> 00:49:50.520
And I don't think he can't.
I don't think he will.
I mean,

958
00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:53.730
why he doesn't want to lose this job.
He's going to.
And all those people,

959
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.790
you know,
they help you get elected.
I know,
but being to do what?

960
00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.530
What are you gonna do?
You a you hold,

961
00:49:58.531 --> 00:50:01.110
are you the holding of barbarians back at the gate?

962
00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.460
I mean there's so many spears and swords comes from Greg gave you,

963
00:50:04.461 --> 00:50:05.940
you're just barely keeping us alive.

964
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.670
<v 4>Think he's doing that.
I think you are.</v>

965
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:12.130
Here's the idea of being president to get your presidential library built,

966
00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.680
whether you serve for eight years and to sell your book and to get your deal,

967
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:20.090
you know,
and to say that you did that in politics because I bet you George W.

968
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.220
Bush has having a dandy all life now and a good old time.

969
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.691
<v 3>Hey Brian,</v>

970
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:25.960
people get real distracted when you start wandering off when we're having

971
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:28.010
conversations.
I'm actually just trying to fix that

972
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.230
<v 4>lag that everyone's talking about right now.
Fix Lag.</v>

973
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.850
Ustream is just being itself.
It's just not that spectacular.
Yeah,

974
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:37.820
I did catch up,
uh,
the,
the Charlie Sheen Ustream,
but it wasn't,

975
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.120
it wasn't the first one was rented to the sleep bad and he had like all his

976
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:43.460
cronies and you realize,
wow,
this is why that guy,

977
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.800
I hadn't heard that name since 1996 who is one of the dudes who was hanging out

978
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:51.830
with Charlie Sheen in that first use?
Treme set.
The guy from Duran Duran,

979
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.370
he was at the TVB Bj and there was some,
some scandal happened.

980
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:59.000
I can't remember what said something.
Put the Kibosh on his fledgling career.

981
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:02.180
Really?
Yeah.
It's something to come on.

982
00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:07.181
Porn man I think involve porn porn man show you like the naked Niccolo Simon

983
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.260
Rex.
I don't remember him.

984
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.440
So he was one of the ones that was one of the hangers on and then you can tell

985
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.690
like the other day looked like some out of work jazz musician.

986
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.400
It's like you can tell like now,

987
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.860
dude was geeking off of drugs and I don't think he was on him,

988
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:23.390
but I think he was geeking off of him and his judgment was super suspect are not

989
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:23.721
already.

990
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:26.990
So I think he was also swimming and all the love that he was getting from all

991
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:28.760
these people winning was all over Twitter.

992
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:31.730
He had over a million followers almost instantly.
And I think he's like,

993
00:51:31.731 --> 00:51:35.210
I'm the fucking shit.
Right?
But I told you these fucking trolls,
they're gonna,

994
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.850
they're gonna wish they didn't get rid of me.
You know,
I'll,
I'll,
you know,

995
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:42.320
I'm going to have the public will demand that I come back.
But man,
you,
that's a,

996
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:45.700
you're,
you're going out there on some fucking thin branches,
son.
It's,

997
00:51:45.701 --> 00:51:48.040
it's very hard for a guy like him.
Uh,
you know,

998
00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.440
to take that Howard Beale kind of zeal that he was taking,

999
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:54.950
because at the end of the day is,
you know,
Howard bill had a lot to say,

1000
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.070
whereas Charlie Sheen has a lot of bumper stickers,
a lot of catch phrases,

1001
00:51:58.071 --> 00:52:00.980
and that's fine.
But as you're seeing as you go out there,

1002
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:05.360
this thing's petering on fumes now and you're starting to realize out Baldwin

1003
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:05.731
did a,

1004
00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:08.990
an op ed piece I think like in the huffpost or something or a direct letter to

1005
00:52:08.991 --> 00:52:12.980
him being like,
quit being a douchebag.
Alec Baldwin.
And he's like,

1006
00:52:12.981 --> 00:52:13.461
here's the thing,

1007
00:52:13.461 --> 00:52:15.710
you're going against Douche bags and you're acting like when you're going to

1008
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:18.530
lose,
you don't,
don't fight the network.
Just just apologize.
Go back.

1009
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:19.311
And I was like,

1010
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:24.020
well you know it apparently Alec Baldwin said he acted like Charlie Sheen during

1011
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:25.820
the,
uh,
the hunt for Red October.

1012
00:52:25.821 --> 00:52:28.520
We're supposed to be a whole bunch of movies for him and he didn't get him cause

1013
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:32.150
he was getting all like that to like bigger than the production.
Oh really?

1014
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:36.350
But you know,
at the end of the day,
if this thing turned out to be a hoax,

1015
00:52:36.351 --> 00:52:38.240
I would say Charlie Sheen's fucking brilliant,

1016
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.930
but he's not brilliant enough to pull off this house.
This is,
you know,

1017
00:52:41.931 --> 00:52:43.610
this is for real and this is sad.

1018
00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:47.450
And it's a guy who I haven't been sad once watching him.

1019
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.610
I've been enjoying the shit out of it.
I can't,

1020
00:52:49.611 --> 00:52:52.460
I can't watch those fucking videos where they show you how they kill pigs.

1021
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.130
You know how they know how they,
you know,
I can't watch those.

1022
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.590
I have ignored me the whole entire thing I have now.

1023
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.620
I've watched a couple of seconds when we talked about it,

1024
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:03.350
will that and that one podcast.
I see,
I'm very into it.
I'm not,
again,

1025
00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.990
a fascinating,
something happens like a lot of people,
there's,
there's people,

1026
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:06.771
something like that will happen.

1027
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:08.750
And then there's the whole sector that people were like,
well,
you know,

1028
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:11.870
screw Charlie Sheen.
Don't,
don't watch him.
It's like,
yeah,
I'm gonna Watch him.

1029
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:14.660
It's the flavor of the day.
It's fun.
It's interesting.
This man's falling down.

1030
00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:17.900
I like it.
I think it's fun.
I think it's a lot of,
I don't think it's good.

1031
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.480
It's definitely not.
I mean,
I wouldn't go,

1032
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.770
maybe I would go to the live show for like 10 minutes.
I would,

1033
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:25.290
if they put it online,
I would watch it.
I'd watch the video of it,

1034
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.220
<v 1>how strange it was.
If it was somebody else,
maybe I just never got into Shane.</v>

1035
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:31.260
I was like,
wow,
I liked hot shots.
I don't think that's about it.

1036
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:36.300
I just want street Wall Street.
Gordon Gecko.
Well,
that was a long time.

1037
00:53:36.301 --> 00:53:39.520
Tunes [inaudible] 87 and 86 a tune.
Best Picture.

1038
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.620
87 nominated,
best picture Wall Street.
He said the guy had a legit,

1039
00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.870
the little run there for a while.
Do you remember that movie?

1040
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:50.090
Was it invasion or something like that?
Alien invasion with the fucking sixish.

1041
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.230
Yeah,
with that black kid and watch it on a higher plane from New York.

1042
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:58.650
Solid fucking Saifai flick.
I was turned on to that by Dave Foley.

1043
00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:02.250
Well do a news radio together and he gave back from the weekend with a big smile

1044
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:06.000
on his face.
He goes,
I saw a really good scifi movie and he told me,

1045
00:54:06.001 --> 00:54:08.550
was this one that I got,
that movie's good.
He's like,
yeah,
what's it called?

1046
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:10.810
Was an alien invasion.
I don't even remember what you're talking about.

1047
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.510
Invasion that people,

1048
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:16.710
I think it's 1996 it was about black kid and him.
That narrows it down,

1049
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:21.711
but I watched it on a plane and I think I watched it on a plane from West

1050
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:26.910
Virginia to Phoenix,
Arizona.
I saw tron the other day.
Finally,

1051
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:31.260
3-d watched most of ad and what you know the CGI with.

1052
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:33.840
Completely horrible for that.
For that dude.

1053
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.630
There's been way better than movies with better to CGI.

1054
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.060
I think I saw your tweet when you're about to get into it.
Some wine,

1055
00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:40.430
some weed and tron.
Yeah.

1056
00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:45.360
I didn't see the after a Simon wrecks in 1993 at age 19 appeared solo in scenes

1057
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:48.420
for three masturbation porn filmed arrival.
Oh,

1058
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:52.320
that's where it came to the surface after he started to get a name for himself.

1059
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:56.460
Yeah.
Yeah,
but the,
the CGI,
what's his name?
Joe.

1060
00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:01.660
Dirt and nasty.
Simon rex is dirt nasties that,
are they the same guy?

1061
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:06.210
No.
Why is your photo?
The photo on Wiki is so wonky.
Wiki,
so crazy,
man.

1062
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.030
See that's that dirt nasty dude.

1063
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.190
It is dirt nasty dude.
That's his website.
Dirt nasty means nasty.

1064
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:19.080
Is Simon Rex could be here,
man.
I'm sure somebody out there nasty.

1065
00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:22.740
It was like a rapper or something.
I thought he is the same guy.
Yeah,

1066
00:55:22.741 --> 00:55:26.850
I think it is.
Cause Sutton wex is kind of like a wicker type,
you know?
Uh,

1067
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.510
makes sense.
Um,
so yeah.
The CGI,

1068
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.210
was it Jeff Goldbloom that's in the movie where they have like a younger version

1069
00:55:33.211 --> 00:55:38.150
of him.
Jeff Goldblum.
Is that his name?
Yeah.
That was so awful though.
Oh wait,
no,

1070
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.850
no,
no.
Nasty is a moniker employed by Simon Rex.

1071
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:46.380
Wow.
Dirt Nastia Simon.
Right?
That's crazy.
Don't know either of them.

1072
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.660
I'm sorry.
He is a dirt nasty.

1073
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:56.070
Has One song that's pretty fucking funny on Youtube.
He's got some good songs,

1074
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:59.260
man.
He was a VJ,
right on MTV.
That's,

1075
00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.230
I guess I don't know him from that.

1076
00:56:01.231 --> 00:56:04.950
I only know him from dirty recently from dirt nasty from some of his songs.

1077
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:09.360
Some people on my,
a message board,
uh,
threw up some of the clips on Youtube.

1078
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:14.750
I fucking funny man.
That's comedy.
Yeah,
it's like comedy,
comedy,
rap.

1079
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.331
That makes sense.

1080
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:18.440
Because I think he did refer to him as dirt nasty in that first early shit.

1081
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.740
They're fucking pretty good man.
It's funny stuff man.
I enjoyed it.
Like in there,

1082
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:25.330
the ramps are pretty cool.
It's like funny.

1083
00:56:25.331 --> 00:56:29.860
It's just you just rapping about partying.
But this,
this Charlie Sheen thing,

1084
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.100
we saw our boy Kurt Fox through the Charlie Sheen thing.

1085
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:36.490
He was that he did do the Charlie with that.
He was the guy who,

1086
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:40.330
but we know the guy who went up and Detroit and bombed and everybody was booing.

1087
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.060
We know that guy.
That's a tough go.

1088
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.910
How many people do you think were there and I didn't feel bad for him.

1089
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:49.000
That's part of life,
Bro.
You want to go out and do that?
That's what you get.

1090
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:50.950
Things happen.
I guess that's what you're asking for.

1091
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:54.820
You're asking to be a part of the circus.
Okay.
Someone's gotta be the Monkey.

1092
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:55.650
Stupid.

1093
00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:59.290
I saw an article that says that Dennis Quaid wants to open for Charlie Sheen.

1094
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:04.000
What?
That's a private tour
once Dennis Quaid and do what?

1095
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:08.580
I've just be crazy.
I guess just as played the actor Randy.
Randy Quaid.
Sorry.

1096
00:57:08.581 --> 00:57:13.150
Sorry.
Sorry,
Dennis,
please.
1980 put up.
Pull up.

1097
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:17.620
1980 dirt nasty.
I can pull it up on,
on Youtube.

1098
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.060
I hate that Randy Quaid guy.
Yeah,
he's weird.
Shit fucked up,

1099
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:25.240
but I like them if in national Lampoon's Christmas vacation,
his cousin Eddie.

1100
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:28.690
That's brilliant.
You Serious Clark?
1980

1101
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.350
yeah,
it's good man.
You're going to like this.

1102
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.620
Is this a rap video?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a rap video and it's,

1103
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.700
tell me when you're going to play it because I like playing saint ready.

1104
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.530
<v 5>These are the chosen few selecting youth.</v>

1105
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.210
These are the ones that shine upon nine meridian with the fourth level of

1106
00:57:50.211 --> 00:57:53.570
government or,
and then the,
the physical vision.

1107
00:57:53.571 --> 00:57:55.860
Now we charge these in a studio right now for the first,

1108
00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:00.470
and he's like wrapping this intertwined my mind upon Bondai nine caliber Russian

1109
00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:03.650
roulette,
stamina,
Thailand off lift the fast track of the anomaly.

1110
00:58:03.651 --> 00:58:04.840
That's preposterous.
Mine.
Yep.

1111
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:09.070
<v 6>Well it's a bet at first towards the Wah Wah.
Shut the fuck up man.</v>

1112
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.020
What's wrong with you?
It would nothing,
man.
You know,
I've been doing good.

1113
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:16.300
Quit smoking weed.
You know,
I've been doing some yoga,
a little polite.

1114
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:19.060
He's just getting more in tune with myself,
you know,
getting in touch with mind,

1115
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:23.500
spirit and body.
That bitch take ahead of this and kicked that out.

1116
00:58:23.501 --> 00:58:26.140
Doubt Nasty Shit about getting your Dick sucked.

1117
00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.820
<v 1>It sounds like phase on love party friends.</v>

1118
00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:32.893
<v 5>Got It.</v>

1119
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:47.590
Well it looks like the guy that was married to Jessica Simpson.

1120
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:52.290
Like what?
Yeah,

I like this song,
man.
It's silly.

1121
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.293
All right.
I like it.

1122
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.970
Spread twin to decide one drink.
Foss

1123
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.890
box strike
pockets.
Right?

1124
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.780
A brand new man and I'm doing dog

1125
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.310
brings light for me.
I think this is a funny man

1126
00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.450
and shit was crazy.
Everybody wanted to know my name.

1127
00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:22.010
Bringed up pain and pops shop ever go one whole my

1128
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.090
<v 4>chain when I fucked it cranks out all the bus.</v>

1129
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:29.510
I got a gold chain among cocaine.
I think I've heard that before,

1130
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:34.190
but I like it man.
I think it's funny.
It's funny.
I thought it was good.

1131
00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:39.570
Three Po Peri Sylville [inaudible] of John La.

1132
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.300
Yeah,
I think John's better than that though.
Yeah,
John's hilarious.
Yeah.

1133
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:46.310
John's got some great shit.
I mean,
this is,
I mean,

1134
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:49.030
I don't know how many other songs he's got,
but yeah,
this was his,
uh,

1135
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.340
this is his debut.
That's funny.
I didn't even know he was hearing that.

1136
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:57.920
I need to start watching this.
Charlie,
Shane,
Shane.
Oh,
well this guy,

1137
00:59:57.921 --> 01:00:00.440
I don't know what he does with them.
I don't know if he wraps.
What does he do?

1138
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:02.150
Does he do that?
I don't know if he goes down the road with him.

1139
01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.540
I just remember he was on the very first song songs hilarious that would,

1140
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:05.811
you know,

1141
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.700
and have the video playing in the background and that would keep the crowd from

1142
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.410
booming.
Yeah.
Maybe they could close with it,
you know,
I dunno.
It's just,

1143
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.460
I dunno always in New York last or this week,
this weekend.
Right.
I heard he did.

1144
01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:19.130
Charlie Sheen,
you,
he was in New York,
the Charlie Sheen report.

1145
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:23.300
We're following him like he's fucking bigfoot.
It's working scene in New York.
Uh,

1146
01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:25.850
and it's working.
I mean,
his whole mission,
you know,

1147
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.870
sort of doing something city to city,
it seems to be getting different reviews.

1148
01:00:29.871 --> 01:00:31.430
But this isn't new.
This isn't.

1149
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:34.190
Now a lot of celebrities are doing this thing going on on tour and not being

1150
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:37.200
comedians.
Who else?
Who else is doing that?
Um,

1151
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.120
or have little experience in comedy?
Steevo uh,
he's,
he's selling out.

1152
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:44.350
He's headlining.
Yeah.
He's doing a stand up though.
Right?
That's creative.

1153
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:48.370
I like him and I'm friends with them and that guy has actually taken the time
to,

1154
01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.510
he really likes comedy and wants to do it,

1155
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.530
whereas he's just been given a lot early on because he's already famous.

1156
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.970
You know,
he's headlining clubs,

1157
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:58.970
but I think he's finding that's hard a way to fill it.
Yeah.

1158
01:00:58.971 --> 01:01:01.250
That's real hard to get thrown in you.
That's how Charlie Murphy did it.

1159
01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:04.250
Charlie Murphy was famous and then he was headlining.
Yeah,
you hit the boom,

1160
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.920
you hit it hard because you're realizing being famous doesn't supplement.

1161
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:11.030
No experience being an open miker in front of a giant group of people that just

1162
01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:15.650
paid to see you famous.
It's too much.
Too soon.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,
it is.
You know,
and,

1163
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:18.980
but you know,
it's Charlie's fault for just diving in there and,
and you know,

1164
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:22.400
and wanting to be a headliner.
I saw that clip of him walking off the stage,

1165
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.400
Karen up the check,
walking up,
walking away

1166
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.680
like that.
And I'm like,
you know,
I see like some Justin,

1167
01:01:29.681 --> 01:01:31.280
you know the thing like with Kirk and all that.

1168
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.020
But then I see guys like bill burr who taken audience and turn it around for a

1169
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.450
scale.
Veterans.
Yeah.
And I can't say anybody like should be that good.

1170
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:39.021
But the thing is,

1171
01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:43.300
it's like a real skill would be to now get them back on your side.
Yeah,

1172
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.370
yeah man.
Yeah,
I know what you're talking about.
I mean,

1173
01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.170
it's the hardest thing in the world.

1174
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.990
You're going to go to Detroit where it's already tough times there and they took

1175
01:01:50.991 --> 01:01:52.850
your money.
That's why then you got no show for them.

1176
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.760
You're just kind of like taking,
they're not gonna take that shit.
Detroit.

1177
01:01:55.761 --> 01:01:58.640
This is experiment,
you know like I understand it's an experiment,

1178
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:02.230
but when you're fucking sell it on giant auditoriums like that,

1179
01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.260
you got to really,

1180
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.250
you want to come fuck you're saying where does he go with this though?

1181
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.970
I don't think he can keep doing it.

1182
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.910
I think eventually people are going to like wear thin of it and he's going to

1183
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:11.750
wear thin of it too.

1184
01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:14.600
Like he wanted to be loved and then all of a sudden half the places where he's

1185
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:14.871
going,

1186
01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:18.200
he's getting booed and people are shitting on them and who's got the world's

1187
01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.010
attention and nothing to say,
yeah I hate and this

1188
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.660
<v 1>is not,
I mean even if he does have something to say,</v>

1189
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:25.800
like he did this one weird video were talked into the camera and he read all

1190
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:28.300
this shit that he wrote.
It was like,
really?

1191
01:02:28.301 --> 01:02:33.301
You like produced and written and then speech kind of moving on and you know,

1192
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:37.920
and he was talking like,
like hunter s Thompson.
Exactly,

1193
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.780
exactly.
And he was like,
it was,
he was doing like,
yeah,
I mean he even said,

1194
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.530
he was like,
he held up,
his fucking is the ticket for this thing.

1195
01:02:46.531 --> 01:02:49.500
He's talking about the ticket and he was doing like a commercial for it.

1196
01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:50.483
Buy The ticket,

1197
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.370
take the ride and like use the hunter s Thompson line did the,

1198
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.310
the whole idea behind it is very strange.
This guy who's this huge,

1199
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:00.900
huge multimillionaire,

1200
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:05.390
super celebrity and we are fascinated with him losing his job and he's trying to

1201
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.830
campaign to get his job back and we're paying money to see him talk.
Right.

1202
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.800
I heard it best describe a lady said,
I read an article,
it said,

1203
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.500
we're so fascinated with Charlie sheen cause the guy,

1204
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:19.890
how can a guy have so much more than us have so much less than half.

1205
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:23.310
That's a great way to get best summation of that guy.
He does.
It's like,
you know,

1206
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:25.890
he's loaded but he's not.
He's got,
he got no marbles.
You know,

1207
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:30.260
I'll keep my marbles.
I do.
It's gone.
You're not good.
Gone Marketable God.

1208
01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:32.970
And like I said,
now you're trying to go the folk hero route.

1209
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:34.340
You're trying to go the Conan O'Brien wrap,

1210
01:03:34.341 --> 01:03:38.430
but Conan O'brien's beloved because he put that much work into being beloved.

1211
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:42.540
You know what I mean?
Here's a perfect example.
When he did his show,

1212
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:47.520
he would go on the road,
he had a show and he's an entertainer.
And the thing is,

1213
01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:51.330
it's like now he's,
he's big enough.
He can go straight to the people and say,

1214
01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:53.640
you're not fuck the network.
People love me.
Sure.

1215
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.880
But I've been doing this since 93 every single fucking night.

1216
01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.840
Charlie Sheen just started this,
you know,
it.
Good luck with that.

1217
01:04:00.841 --> 01:04:03.810
I think he fizzles out.
If,
if what's his name,

1218
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:05.310
wanted to have Conan O'brien wanted to,

1219
01:04:05.311 --> 01:04:08.550
he could do arenas all over the country and he would do like,

1220
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:12.690
he would be in Detroit one night and do a show with no television whatsoever and

1221
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:15.450
higher comics and higher,
you know,
have people come on,

1222
01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:19.410
have musicians play and do the Conan O'brien show like a say a 90 minute show.

1223
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:22.760
And he could do it all over the country and make fucking ridiculous amounts of

1224
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.740
money about a guy who had a real grievances with the neck.
You know what I mean?

1225
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:28.380
And never really aired them in a distasteful way yet.

1226
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.440
All that whole thing is so hard to fucking really figure out.

1227
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:32.340
I mean cause Jay Leno,

1228
01:04:32.341 --> 01:04:34.770
they kept wanting to get rid of Jay Leno and Jaylin was number one.

1229
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.491
Like why did that,

1230
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:37.860
why would they want to get rid of whole thing was really ass handed.

1231
01:04:37.861 --> 01:04:41.040
The way they did it was so dumb and really Conan O'brien was better in the later

1232
01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:42.690
night.
I thought so too.
They should have done,

1233
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:44.430
I mean everybody wants the tonight show,

1234
01:04:44.431 --> 01:04:47.130
but I'll tell you what the Conan O'brien show was his fucking show man.

1235
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:50.580
It was his show.
It was his,
there was a whole culture behind it.
And the thing is,

1236
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:51.510
it's like the tonight show,

1237
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:55.080
you almost need to be a lot more generic like Jay Leno to appeal to the masses.

1238
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:58.320
But there was a,
there was,
this is our thing,
when you watch Conan late night,

1239
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:01.770
you know,
when I see someone wanting to leave their job and go to another job,

1240
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:02.551
you know that's an early,

1241
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:06.570
I mean I get the fact that more people are going to be watching earlier.

1242
01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.920
I get that,
but what I would it says to me is that guy didn't get enough respect.

1243
01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:13.290
He didn't get enough appreciation from the network.
There wasn't,

1244
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:18.070
they weren't like in behind him enough in his eyes and feel equal.
You

1245
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.340
<v 4>know,
he wanted that other job,
that other jobs,
the big job,
big job,</v>

1246
01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.700
right about that big job.
Right.
You know when you're fucking Conan O'brien,

1247
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.900
man with differences make of you shows on at 10 or if it's on an 11 Conan
O'brien

1248
01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.500
watches TV live.
Exactly.
I mean,
yeah,
you're not,

1249
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:36.100
some people are going to miss it because they're going to go to bed early.

1250
01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:40.390
So fucking what?
Plenty of people are going to watch it.
All right.
Just just be,

1251
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:43.150
you just be with a left.
Apparently over at CVS,
they're like,

1252
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.630
if he gets ratings like this,
he'll stay on forever.
Life at TBS,

1253
01:05:46.631 --> 01:05:49.090
you get 2 million ratings or 2 million periods.
You're fucking hit.

1254
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.780
I went from being a big Conan fan to having,
I've watched it once on TV.

1255
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.110
I haven't watched it.
I didn't watch it when you did the tonight show.

1256
01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:58.510
I haven't watched since he left New York.
Yeah.
Not that I'm against them.

1257
01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:02.520
It's just that routine has gone better now.
Is it worth,
I don't think so.
I think,

1258
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.190
I think the reason why I don't watch it,

1259
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.020
cause th the late night shows what I liked.
I liked that that extra masturbating,

1260
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.900
masturbating,
bear writers were all funny on that show.

1261
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:13.720
They'd come out and do [inaudible] you know at the same writers.

1262
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.990
I don't see those two guys.
He sees these two guys all the time.

1263
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:21.550
The preparation h Raymond Guy.
Right.
Who had come out and hand up around.
I said,

1264
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.230
yeah,
he kind of looks like Ryan O'Neal,

1265
01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:26.710
the comedian and then there was another one with the curly like Simon and

1266
01:06:26.711 --> 01:06:28.770
Garfunkel.
Fro.
Yeah,
I think they're both still around.

1267
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.940
Those guys were like almost funnier than Conant to me,

1268
01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:35.500
but there was that whole New York vibe that it just as missing to me.

1269
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:38.560
But I don't know.
I think the vibe is different because it's in Los Angeles.

1270
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:39.930
It might be,
but the thing is I,

1271
01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:42.570
I can't speak intelligently about it cause I don't watch it.
You know,

1272
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.580
I watched Conan from 93 to 2003 mostly because at first I was a teenager and

1273
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:49.450
then I looked in Hollywood.
I didn't have cable at the time.

1274
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.060
It was something to fall asleep too.

1275
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:54.200
There's definitely a different funny vibe on the east coast and there isn't a

1276
01:06:54.201 --> 01:06:54.641
west coast.

1277
01:06:54.641 --> 01:06:57.010
I find even my sets are different on the east coast and they're on the west

1278
01:06:57.011 --> 01:07:00.610
coast.
I find I have to explain less on the east coast and I can go off into more

1279
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:03.070
obscure references and not in a way like super obscure it,

1280
01:07:03.071 --> 01:07:06.040
but in the way that everybody's following along and I don't have to make sure

1281
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:08.350
somebody needs to catch up,
you know?
I think,

1282
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:10.880
I mean there's intelligent people everywhere,
but there's more of them,

1283
01:07:10.881 --> 01:07:13.930
these coast.
Sure.
I mean,
that's where all our finest institutions are.
You know,

1284
01:07:13.931 --> 01:07:14.890
it's no accident that,

1285
01:07:14.891 --> 01:07:19.240
that all our best colleges are on the east coast finest institution.
Ah,
yes.

1286
01:07:19.241 --> 01:07:21.790
Harvard.
So she'd have a cigar in your hand when you say that.

1287
01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:24.320
So I did sound like a real ass,
and I ask God as well,

1288
01:07:24.321 --> 01:07:28.150
all of our finest institutions haven't really addicted to camel to lately.

1289
01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:31.690
I think when,
when the Conan left,
I started watching Kimmel and now I'm like,

1290
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.760
I don't know.
Once you go Kamilah you can't really go,
yeah,
here's a fun show.

1291
01:07:34.761 --> 01:07:39.160
I've got a fun zoo of a show too.
I did that show and I think it was the first,

1292
01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:41.000
the second comedian on there and I,
oh right.

1293
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:44.080
I heard nightmare stories when they first started,
how hard it was.

1294
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.570
Like the stage was catty corner to the audience.
It was new.

1295
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:48.130
Nobody knew who he was.
They were like,

1296
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:49.420
you're going to go out there and you're gonna die kid.

1297
01:07:49.421 --> 01:07:53.530
Bobcat Goldthwait was the director at the time and I was like,
Oh man,
oh,

1298
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:56.500
this is scary.
And I went out,
it went really good.
And he's like,
man,

1299
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:59.800
you're the best comic we've had on.
I'm like,
how many head on?
He's like,
one.

1300
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.890
I was like,
oh well who is the other comp I,

1301
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:04.420
and I don't even remember the other comic was,
but I don't think it was anybody,

1302
01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.360
you know,
cause I wasn't anybody.
So that's who they were picking out at the time.

1303
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.560
But I think Dave Ras saw me at the Improv on a Wednesday night doing the open

1304
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:13.660
mic.
I was 23.
He's like,
Hey,
we want to,

1305
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:16.040
you want to do the Jimmy Kimmel show tonight?
I'm like,
I guess,
sure.

1306
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.250
<v 1>What's that?
Wow.
And uh,
I,
and he got me on.</v>

1307
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:23.510
So wherever day of wrath is like forever,
owe him my first,
uh,
TV.
Great.

1308
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:27.470
It's good man.
He's a very good guy.
Very good guy.

1309
01:08:27.471 --> 01:08:28.820
He's one of those guys have been around forever.

1310
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.460
The comedy business is such a weird fucking business,
isn't it?

1311
01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:35.500
And we were talking about sleazy and agents and managers and you know,

1312
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:39.350
we were talking about what it's like to have one that sucks and it's weird.

1313
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.920
It's a weird thing to,

1314
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:44.540
it's like in this business it's like you can have all this drive but you have
to,

1315
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.740
it's almost like being in a band.

1316
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:49.160
You need somebody else to champion that drive as well.
Like I love music,

1317
01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:51.410
but I never wanted to be in a band because I don't want to have to rely on the

1318
01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:54.770
lazy bass player or the coke head drummer.
You know?

1319
01:08:54.771 --> 01:08:56.370
It's like I want this thing to happen.

1320
01:08:56.371 --> 01:08:58.760
And you know when you've got a team working for you like that and they're not on

1321
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:02.840
board,
you're like son of a,
yeah,
that's a reoccurring theme with comics.

1322
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:05.570
You gotta make sure you've got a manager that knows what the fuck is going on

1323
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:08.510
and if you get a bad one,
he gets some idiot.
You get attached to one.

1324
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.230
I have a bunch of friends that started out with one manager and then somewhere

1325
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.690
along the line,
you know,
this a manager,

1326
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:16.790
when some critical decision was to be made,

1327
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:19.670
this manager fucked up and they got rid of them and they moved on and got some

1328
01:09:19.671 --> 01:09:23.430
bigger manager and then they got sued and a bunch of stupid shit happen.

1329
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.750
I mean you start off with one guy and that guy turns out to suck and you know

1330
01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.640
you're attached that fucking idiot.
Right.

1331
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:31.400
And he feels like he deserves a percentage of your profits.

1332
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.950
Then it becomes like a marriage and store and then you have to break up with

1333
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:36.470
this person.
Yeah,
exactly.
Just such a nightmare.

1334
01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:40.010
Like I had been my manager six years and I had to break up and she was very

1335
01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:42.010
receptive and understanding about it,
you know?

1336
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.600
And that made me think in my mind like,
Oh man,
this,

1337
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.210
it didn't go as bad as I thought it would.
And then you start thinking,

1338
01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:49.970
I should've done it sooner and all that.
But it's just like,
you know,

1339
01:09:49.971 --> 01:09:51.020
whatever happens,
happens.

1340
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:54.950
But you can't stay with somebody who doesn't have your best interests at heart.

1341
01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:55.760
You know,
it's,

1342
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.970
it's that usually cause they'd have a better client now they have a better,

1343
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:02.540
bigger fish to fry and you know,
I get it in this town.
That's,
that's the truth.

1344
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.640
My agent,
you know,
represents like Jamie Foxx and all these people.
If they don't,

1345
01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:08.480
if they turn it down then maybe I'll get an audition for it.

1346
01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:12.260
He want to make sure that you're a real moneymaker before they put any interest

1347
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:13.120
in time and deal.

1348
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.190
You've got to go out and it's almost like they have you in the stable and then

1349
01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:18.050
you got to go out and make your own shit happen.
Yeah,

1350
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:22.340
call us and we'll take the 10% when you booked out and then,
then they go,
okay,

1351
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:25.670
now let's make it bigger.
Yeah.
But like getting Christmas presents from Jews.

1352
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.361
I mean they're,

1353
01:10:26.361 --> 01:10:28.880
the best thing they can do is just get you in front of someone where you can

1354
01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:31.120
perform.
You know,
especially if you're trying it,

1355
01:10:31.121 --> 01:10:33.020
you're out there trying to do the acting thing.
Man,

1356
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:37.670
what a crazy job that is going to go in some fucking room and pretend that this

1357
01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:39.500
guy that you're sitting there with a piece of paper in his hand,

1358
01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:42.070
pretend that this is your brother and you guys are,
you know,

1359
01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:45.440
back at home and dad just got back from the war and he's a little shell shocked.

1360
01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.500
Really going to do this right here.
We'll do this in this office.

1361
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:51.350
I had an acting teacher like that who always wanted to,
w w wanted to.

1362
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.350
He's one of these super stranger.
It was the Meisner technique,

1363
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:57.740
you know the real like a method to kind of stuff and he,

1364
01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:01.130
his whole goal was to make you cry and he would be like,
what?

1365
01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:03.840
What happened to your mother got killed in a car accident?
Oh Geez.

1366
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.040
Awful Shit to say,
dude.
Like I'm not going to cry.

1367
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:10.580
I'm getting pissed at you actually for thinking that you need fucked up people

1368
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.770
for actors.
If you're going to have actors you want have real good ones,

1369
01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:15.600
those people better be fucked up.
Most of them.

1370
01:11:15.601 --> 01:11:17.700
This is a few of them that aren't fucked up at a really good actress,

1371
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:21.750
but mostly few and far between.
Most of them are on mass.

1372
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.370
Daniel Day Lewis is a bit,
and it's gotta be crazy.
He's so good.
He's so good.

1373
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:30.060
He's got to be completely,
I live on a farm somewhere in Scotland or something,

1374
01:11:30.061 --> 01:11:32.280
man.
Think about how good that motherfucker is.

1375
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:33.870
Remember that movie where he played a boxer?

1376
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.590
The motherfucker became a boxer for like a year trained every day like a boxer.

1377
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.641
You Watch that movie.

1378
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:43.641
That is the best portrayal of a boxer in a movie where he looks,

1379
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.170
he looks like a real boxer,

1380
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:50.250
not some bullshit like Sylvester Stallone movie where it looks like he never

1381
01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:52.560
threw a punch and a man in a competition has life,

1382
01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:55.020
right to worry about being countered.
You know,
Daniel Day Lewis,

1383
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:58.560
his hands up move in,
throwing faints.
He looks like a real goddamn box.

1384
01:11:58.561 --> 01:12:02.590
Broken nose and all that.
Genius is a genius actor.
He just comes out of the,

1385
01:12:02.591 --> 01:12:04.440
it comes out in the public like every four years,

1386
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.590
perhaps an Oscar and comes back home.
Nuts.
The guys completely out of his mind,

1387
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.370
but he's amazing.
He is fucking gangs in New York.

1388
01:12:11.371 --> 01:12:14.620
Remember that Jesus Christ was a Bob.
The builder put your heel,

1389
01:12:14.621 --> 01:12:16.920
the butcher or something and there will be blood.

1390
01:12:16.921 --> 01:12:21.290
He was absolutely [inaudible] fuck adding or who can do that?
Oh,

1391
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:25.020
who can do that?
Like him?
Nobody and they'll only stays that way in his trailer,

1392
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.780
you know?
Yeah.
There's a few guys.
It's a few of those guys.

1393
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:30.770
Russell Crowe is fat as fuck now.
I haven't seen him in like,

1394
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.850
oh my goodness here it can picture of him.

1395
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:36.000
He went on a bike ride and he stopped and he's got his like bike outfit on a

1396
01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:40.110
stupid little helmet and he's smoking a cigarette and he is fat as fuck.

1397
01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:44.220
That's funny.
Like he's just gigantic fat.
I got a couple of years since I,
yes,

1398
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:46.500
I had a picture.
I since all the fat when he did Robin Hood,
man,

1399
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:48.180
he had a cut way to make Robin too.

1400
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:51.300
You can't have a rotting Robin Hood as a fat guy,

1401
01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:54.740
but he's one of those can't hard drinking hard smoking act or dudes.
Yeah,

1402
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:58.170
he's a wild man.
It's crazy.
Fucker.
That's why he's so good.

1403
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.440
I watched a beautiful mind on the way to Australia out of respect,

1404
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:03.990
because I was going to Australia anyway.
Yeah,
and it was on the plane.

1405
01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:06.430
It was one of those options.
Forgot.
I'll fucking go that move.

1406
01:13:06.431 --> 01:13:09.900
And that was 2000 best picture of 2001 I think.
Best Picture.

1407
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.890
I don't know what it was.
Fucking gladiator.
One,
2000 and then that one,
one,

1408
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:15.720
2001 he was cleaning up at that.
You know,

1409
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:19.580
I watched the other day that I forgot how fucking good it was.
Contact.
Oh yeah.

1410
01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.290
I watched that recently on Netflix,
dude.

1411
01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:24.390
I put it on Twitter and all these people are going,
Whoa,
Whoa,

1412
01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:28.010
are you God took soaks texts.
All awesome.
You're gay.

1413
01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:32.760
You are gay bar.
The letter u.
The letter are gay.

1414
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.710
Hello.
Hey,
contact socks.
No,
it's contacts.
Great.
I watched that recently.

1415
01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:40.230
I wrote that.
Yeah.
You know what?
You know,
what's that horrible movie,

1416
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:44.260
but almost in that same idea,
it's again with uh,

1417
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.520
Dennis Quaid and he's got the CB radio and he's talking to the past.

1418
01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:53.990
Oh,
know what you're talking about?
Yeah.
Chimko visal yes.

1419
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.160
This is like one word.

1420
01:13:56.190 --> 01:14:01.170
Like Glen happened to that guy played fucking genius and he's gone and he's
gone.

1421
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.620
That doesn't even make sense.
I mean,
that guy should have been gigantic door.

1422
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:08.010
That movie was a huge movie,
was huge,
but it was one of those movies,

1423
01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:12.280
I think where the movie was huge or than who was in it.
And here's another issue.

1424
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.350
The movie was very antisemitic,
very antisemitic.
I mean that was the argued,

1425
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.440
you know,
whether or not that was historically accurate or I dunno what,

1426
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:23.110
whatever the fuck it is.
You don't know you weren't there.

1427
01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:25.690
And the way it's depicted,
it's,
it's to picked it to me,

1428
01:14:25.691 --> 01:14:30.250
like the Jews will be huge problem,
which is,
I don't know if it's me.
Look,

1429
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:33.600
the whole thing I think is fiction in the first place and I don't,
I just,

1430
01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:37.270
it seems to me the whole story is so convoluted.

1431
01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:39.070
And even if there was a man named Jesus,

1432
01:14:39.071 --> 01:14:40.750
who knows what the fuck really went down,

1433
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.390
<v 4>I can still get why people will buy that and then not buy other things.</v>

1434
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.820
It's like,
yeah,
no world's not getting warmer.
No wait,
no,
no,

1435
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:46.840
no global warming here.

1436
01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:49.700
<v 1>But there's a story of this guy who came back from the dead.
It's like,
wait,</v>

1437
01:14:49.701 --> 01:14:51.970
where are you?
Where are your priorities?
You know?

1438
01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:55.110
But Jim Caviezel playing him was really strange because you know,

1439
01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:57.870
he got really obsessed with it because he was 33 at the,

1440
01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.980
and [inaudible] is 33 name is JC.
Yeah.
And you know,
I mean,
how funny is it?

1441
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:07.890
This movie is incredibly religious movie that made incredible amounts of money

1442
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.720
was made by us psychopath and absolute [inaudible].

1443
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.590
Now that you look at it in the past and you look at who he is now and the hear

1444
01:15:16.591 --> 01:15:17.810
those tapes where he's,

1445
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.950
you should Josh blow man,

1446
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:25.110
just insane.
Red Hide,

1447
01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.790
spit flying out of his fucking mouth.
I mean,
he's off the deep end.
Crazy.

1448
01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.150
And he made the most successful religious movie of all time.

1449
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:34.590
<v 4>Like bonded it himself.
Yeah.</v>

1450
01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.590
And then had to turn that profit to incredible amounts of money because of it.

1451
01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:43.840
Yeah.
He never saw a passion of the Christ.
I did it.

1452
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.880
I used to have a bit about it that it was a two hour movie about a dude with

1453
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:49.670
magic who got his ass kicked and I go,

1454
01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:52.940
that is the last movie with subtitles I'll ever see without confluent.
It.

1455
01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.310
Wasn't that an Aramaic or something like I remember that.
Yeah.

1456
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:59.360
People were coming out of theaters all moved and crying.
I don't,
yeah,

1457
01:15:59.361 --> 01:16:01.400
I don't know what the language was.
It might've been Aramaic.

1458
01:16:01.401 --> 01:16:02.860
I think that's what they spoke at the time.
Right.

1459
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:06.500
What they spoken and they offered up the subtitles.
But if only want subtitles.

1460
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:07.940
Yeah.
It's unlike you.

1461
01:16:07.941 --> 01:16:10.730
It's either comfort or some Swedish weird film where people are going to get

1462
01:16:10.731 --> 01:16:15.370
killed or some Japanese horror movie.
Green Goo,
you know,
I'll watch ring to ours.

1463
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:18.440
Labyrinth.
Um,
people want to believe,
man.

1464
01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:20.810
They want to believe and they don't want you to take it away from them.

1465
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:25.100
Netflix has just offered up,
for instance,
stream my favorite TV show of all time.

1466
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.520
The twilight zone,
1959 and a bunch of shit.

1467
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:31.640
And I thought about you because the very first episode is an episode called

1468
01:16:31.641 --> 01:16:36.290
where is everybody where the man is undergoing a sensory deprivation experiment

1469
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:38.930
and losing his fucking mind while doing it.

1470
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.080
And it's revealed at the end obviously that it's a military experiment,

1471
01:16:42.081 --> 01:16:46.430
but that's uh,
that show spoiler alert,
huge.
Uh,

1472
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:51.530
it aired and 59,
I got a POB.
Right.
Bags.
I have something on a subject.
Okay,
cool.

1473
01:16:51.531 --> 01:16:54.050
Yeah.
At [inaudible] 59.
So I figured what the hell.
Yeah,

1474
01:16:54.051 --> 01:16:56.240
there's certain shows like that that I love watching.

1475
01:16:56.241 --> 01:17:00.110
One is that I had another thing,
it's just like old,
like Laura and Hardee's.

1476
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:03.530
I love fucking Netflix that become addicted to it.

1477
01:17:03.531 --> 01:17:08.180
Netflix has made me this document documentary watching asphalt.

1478
01:17:08.181 --> 01:17:11.270
Like I'm and I'm,
and I'll watch one on like belly button lint.
I'll be like,

1479
01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:14.340
did you see that belly button there?
Have you noticed though?
Like,
like normal.

1480
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:16.970
The other day I just realized that for cable TV,

1481
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:21.520
I how much I spend per month for cable TV.
I Bet I would think 95% of the,
the,

1482
01:17:21.521 --> 01:17:26.510
the content that I watch,
his family guy,
I'll lay in bed,
turn on cartoon network.

1483
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.600
Oh,
family guy watch it for three hours,
go to bed.
Right.
But it's like amazing.

1484
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:34.270
Like how much I wish that we could get to a point of cable TV where we can Ella

1485
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.180
cartoony all,
you know,
they say they'll never do that though because it's like,

1486
01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:41.960
but cable is offering now.
Like I saw it,
my mom said I had like on the man,

1487
01:17:41.961 --> 01:17:45.580
like you can get HBO premium.
Like one thing that Aaron Hbo,
but I don't want,

1488
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:48.320
I don't turn my TV on hardly ever.
Yeah.
I mean hardly ever.

1489
01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:51.050
I watch everything on my computer and my phone in here,
you know what I mean?

1490
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:54.200
And I get the updates.
Who's got the new documentaries coming on?

1491
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:57.890
Netflix and all that stuff,
you know,
and I'll watch the most boring of crap too.

1492
01:17:57.891 --> 01:17:58.690
I don't care.

1493
01:17:58.690 --> 01:18:02.300
<v 1>Source Code is a pretty fucking good movie man.
Source Code.</v>

1494
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:06.670
Jake Glen Allen Hall,
the new mode.
Pretty fucking good movie man.
Yeah,

1495
01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.810
it's about a god.

1496
01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.880
I don't want to tell you the whole story because I don't want to give it away,

1497
01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.600
but it's,
it's really interesting and it involves time travel.

1498
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:19.540
It's pretty dope.
Moving handle,
visiting his time,
traveling.
Uh,
Donnie Darko.

1499
01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:23.650
He was,
uh,
it was also a time traveling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No Shit.
Yeah,
yeah.
True.
Yeah.

1500
01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:27.430
It's a very well regarded one too.
Yeah,
it's a good one.
Yeah.
This is a,

1501
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.520
this is very interesting.
I don't know if it's as good as Donnie Darko,

1502
01:18:30.521 --> 01:18:34.000
but I don't remember because I haven't seen done Darko and a long time,
you know,

1503
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:37.480
movies like they become mythical.
Like Donnie Darko.
It's one of those moments.

1504
01:18:37.481 --> 01:18:42.440
So it was one of those movies was bad ass,
bad ass guy,
peers,
some of his,
the,

1505
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.090
the seem a lot better because they were a long time and then he'd go back and

1506
01:18:46.091 --> 01:18:49.930
watch them and go,
that wasn't that good.
Or I was just young and dumb.

1507
01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.290
I remember Donnie Darko being weird.
It was weird but it does have,

1508
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:57.460
it does hold up.
Have you ever seen primer?
That's the best time travel movie.

1509
01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.900
A great movie.
Yeah.
That one is it that you got to watch that one a few times.

1510
01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:05.020
Really independent movie.
Very small budget.
Considered like one of the best.

1511
01:19:05.021 --> 01:19:07.480
I mean you know you,
you talk back to the future.
That's you know,

1512
01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:09.970
for layman's purposes that works great.

1513
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:15.370
They laid the rules for primer is one of those where they really adhere to the

1514
01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:16.450
rules and the time,

1515
01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.440
you know the fabric of time and how you can't do this and you can get sick and

1516
01:19:20.441 --> 01:19:21.490
all that.
She liked the things,

1517
01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.030
the nuances about actual time traveling that people have taken to study.

1518
01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.670
Here's what would happen to your body if you did that.
You know,

1519
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.370
Tom was the most fascinating subject of all to me.

1520
01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.390
I don't know that I don't think of it.

1521
01:19:31.391 --> 01:19:35.170
I mean I think eventually it's going to be breached.
It has to be.

1522
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.050
That's the end of time.
Human beings are going to figure out everything.

1523
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:41.560
We figured out so much so far and we were not going to stop and as long as we

1524
01:19:41.561 --> 01:19:43.330
stay alive,
and they just found some,

1525
01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.630
they just found out that the Caldera volcano under Yellowstone is way bigger

1526
01:19:46.631 --> 01:19:49.900
than previously thought.
Oh really?
It's fucking giant Super Volcano.

1527
01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.990
It kills everybody and just found out it's even bigger.
Anyway,

1528
01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.950
if something like that doesn't happen,
people are going to continue to innovate.

1529
01:19:56.951 --> 01:20:00.590
They're going to continue to make a faster phone,
a faster computer,
uh,
uh,

1530
01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.000
a car that doesn't need to be recharged for a month.

1531
01:20:04.001 --> 01:20:09.001
It's going to be Internet through the air at ridiculous fiber optic speeds.

1532
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:13.260
It's all going to eventually come to a up ahead.
He's gonna come to that rate.

1533
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:14.760
Kurt's wheel singularity,

1534
01:20:14.761 --> 01:20:18.690
that Terence Mckenna TimeWave zero point of infinite novelty.

1535
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.060
It's going to happen,
man.
It's,
it has to,

1536
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:24.960
it's a thing where it's like you see more and more articles that talk about how

1537
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.890
in theory,
I think it's,
I mean,
Einstein proved,

1538
01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.920
in theory it's absolutely possible,
but now they're really,

1539
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.750
there's funding private funding,

1540
01:20:33.751 --> 01:20:37.050
but funding going towards actually taking this seriously.

1541
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:39.740
If we're going to take all that seriously,
let's take this through to it.

1542
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:43.620
It's just like the nuclear power issue.
They were there,

1543
01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:47.550
the nuclear power issue is something where they came up with something and they

1544
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:51.090
figured out how to do it and then they just went ahead and do it without having

1545
01:20:51.091 --> 01:20:52.650
it completely worked out.
All right.

1546
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:57.420
They went ahead and did it without having some,
you know,
agreed upon,
you know,

1547
01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:57.691
uh,

1548
01:20:57.691 --> 01:21:02.691
ability to shut it off without having some agreed upon ability to store all the

1549
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:06.210
waste before we start producing it.
They just started doing it.

1550
01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:08.460
They just started doing it and then we're going to do that with everything.

1551
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.620
But they did that with the space program,
all that.

1552
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:13.590
They do that with everything they do that they're doing with the large Hadron

1553
01:21:13.591 --> 01:21:16.260
collider and they're,
they're out there and you know,
smashing atoms,

1554
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:19.620
making a Higgs Boson particle and creating little miniature black holes.

1555
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:21.600
They really are not exactly sure what's going to happen.

1556
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:24.530
They're taking some chances and sometimes things go wrong and that's,

1557
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.510
and things are going wrong in Japan right now and they're going to continue to

1558
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:28.950
go wrong and as well as go right.

1559
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.770
But no matter what things are gonna keep moving,

1560
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:36.540
they moved past the nuclear bombs of the 1940s to what we're capable of today.

1561
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.780
And that's going to be nothing compared to anti-matter weapons that are,

1562
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:42.660
they're coming up with right now.
They're coming up with some shit right now.

1563
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:46.140
Actual Reagan's that we're seeing the laser that they shot down,
they,

1564
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.000
they did a demonstration recently where they,
um,

1565
01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:54.480
a boat was a mile away and they shot it with this laser and caused the,
um,
the,

1566
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:58.670
um,
uh,
engines to catch on fire from a mile away.
You know,

1567
01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.590
so they've got some crazy shit.
They're working on that.

1568
01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.650
That's nothing compared to,
I'm sure a bunch of their shit.
The drones,

1569
01:22:04.651 --> 01:22:07.320
the drones and the scariest thing,
man,
these fucking,
the,

1570
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:11.070
their ability to operate these little tiny machines that looked like bugs,

1571
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:11.821
you know,
they can,

1572
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:15.900
they can get them little tiny ones and flying around and fucking make videos.

1573
01:22:15.901 --> 01:22:17.000
And people insurance that's,

1574
01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:18.870
have you seen there's even a thing for the iPhone now,

1575
01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:21.460
that little helicopter you can fly.
They've had their first,
uh,

1576
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:26.520
a friendly fire incident with drones as well.
There was a thing today.

1577
01:22:26.521 --> 01:22:29.560
I retweeted it.
It's on my Twitter.
If you're interested.
There's a,

1578
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:33.290
some drones kilts and fucking people really killed some US soldiers.
Yeah.

1579
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:36.970
Oh yeah.
It was a,
it was off the drudge report.
They're flying drones and Japan.

1580
01:22:36.971 --> 01:22:39.150
It's food right now,
aren't they?
To get a look inside the reactor.

1581
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.350
I would assume they would do something like that.
It's pretty accurate now.

1582
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:46.230
It's really scary shit man.
It is.
You know,
you retweeted.

1583
01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:49.470
I was even better than that though.
Kitty kissing a dolphin.
Oh,

1584
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:51.960
that was the cutest thing.
I could watch that shit all day.

1585
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:54.330
He's a cat and a dolphin being all snuggly with each other.

1586
01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:56.150
That was the cutest thing ever,
man.

1587
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.460
I wonder if that's like one of the first times a dolphin has played with the
cat.

1588
01:22:59.461 --> 01:23:01.380
The cat was a bad motherfucker.
He didn't care.

1589
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:05.340
He's like hanging out over the water and he's not even trippin Cath can't on

1590
01:23:05.341 --> 01:23:08.260
swim.
They would freak out if they fell in that instant death.
Meanwhile,

1591
01:23:08.261 --> 01:23:10.900
he's like,
you know,
dancing on the edge.
It doesn't care.

1592
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:15.070
It's me can swatted the dolphin.
I haven't seen that.
It's truly an os.
Very cute.

1593
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.140
Especially for a guy like Brian Price who loves them.

1594
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.010
He loves his little kitties.
Kitties.
You have that one of the switch fee.

1595
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:27.460
Had too many kitties.
I have to get on a dog and I'm so sick of it.
Oh,

1596
01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:32.380
I retweeted this.
Um,
the,
uh,
uh,
Asu adult film star did not get,

1597
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:37.120
uh,
she did not go to,
she did not get kicked out.
She didn't get suspended.

1598
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:39.160
No.
I mean,
I was going to say that they're pretty lenient.

1599
01:23:39.161 --> 01:23:43.060
Campus did not get her scholarship revoked.
It's not like,
that's not,
you know,

1600
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.260
yeah.
Party school central there.
Yeah.
The A,
apparently it was a,

1601
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:52.240
the whole thing is scripted.
She says,
I knew going in there,

1602
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:53.350
it was for sex.

1603
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.880
She said she was paid $2,000 and insured the video would only appear on the part

1604
01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:01.360
of the website people had to pay to see.
That didn't happen.

1605
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:05.970
The video found its way on to free porn sites like pores.
Well,

1606
01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:10.000
she has no cases or anything.
Of course.
Of course.
Welcome to the Internet.
Hey,

1607
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:12.520
let me teach you about,
yeah,
the Internet's this perpetual adequate.

1608
01:24:12.521 --> 01:24:17.270
It's there forever.
So I guess they just can let you eat.

1609
01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:21.010
There's the school says go do some porn.
Do you still have your scholarship?

1610
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.740
I mean half the people in score and Bray Asu.

1611
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.640
It's amazing how porn is acceptable.
As long as it's an accident.
You know,

1612
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.660
like Kim Kardashian of Kim Kardashians got hired by vivid and got gang fuck by

1613
01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:35.380
50 football players,
shot loads in their mouth,
then she'd be done.

1614
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.640
Nobody would want to have anything to do with her.

1615
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:40.780
But the fact that it was like her man and she was fucking him.
And meanwhile,

1616
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:42.730
why is there so many cameras?
What's going on here?

1617
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.760
There's cameras are from weird angles,
I guess people in the room with you.
Okay.

1618
01:24:45.761 --> 01:24:48.970
What the fuck is going on,
man?
I just cuts one shots,
two shots.

1619
01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.580
What kind of a video is this?
You know,
and what is it?
You know,

1620
01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:55.090
what the fuck was that like,
but that somehow or another is acceptable.

1621
01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:58.420
It's the most ridiculous hoax over.
It's fortuitous for them.

1622
01:24:58.421 --> 01:24:59.380
It's a career builder.

1623
01:24:59.381 --> 01:25:02.200
I mean she's who she is because of that takes these gigantic dude,

1624
01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:06.910
she's gigantic.
She's bigger than all of us.
Pretty much everyone we know clocks.

1625
01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.830
Geez.
That pitches on billboards in Australia almost that she was on cosmos.

1626
01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:13.930
The cover of a Turkey version yesterday.

1627
01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:17.590
There was a big uproar because Turkey put her on the cover of the Turkish

1628
01:25:17.591 --> 01:25:19.960
version of Cosmo,
you know,
tourniquets,
Turks and Armenians,

1629
01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:22.300
that little bad blood there.
Oh really?

1630
01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:25.080
And she's an Armenian and she's an Armenian.
And,
uh,
she's,

1631
01:25:25.081 --> 01:25:28.420
she's gracing the cover of a Turkish publication,
not by her choice.

1632
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:31.060
Cosmo went and did it without her.
Uh,
but it was funny,

1633
01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:35.050
a bunch of our videos got pissed cause Koby Bryant did a spot for Turkish

1634
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:37.150
Airlines.
It's like he's gotten a horse in that race.
You know what I mean?

1635
01:25:37.151 --> 01:25:40.210
That I understand he should do that.
But her,
it's like,
yeah,

1636
01:25:40.211 --> 01:25:42.520
that's a little weird.
That's a little weird.
It's a little weird.

1637
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:46.060
Like Morty Solomon wearing a swastika.

1638
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:51.030
Almost what w the way society is set up right now with like these teen moms

1639
01:25:51.031 --> 01:25:55.660
shows and the real housewives of Beverly Hills and Kim Kardashians.

1640
01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:59.830
It's almost like the scene in the running man when they have those ridiculous

1641
01:25:59.831 --> 01:26:03.950
shows.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean it is so you're so right.

1642
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.000
It's almost like it's getting to this weird sort of surreal point where it's

1643
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:10.310
like,
wow,
this is what everyone's fixated on.

1644
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:13.400
The fascinated by 16 year olds and get knocked up,

1645
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:17.990
have a TV show now and you see them scream at their boyfriend can't up you

1646
01:26:17.991 --> 01:26:21.410
fucking lazy fat piece of Shit and the hell out of weeping and everything's

1647
01:26:21.411 --> 01:26:21.891
beeping.

1648
01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:24.650
And the guy gets in the car and he's taken the baby and the girls screaming in

1649
01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:29.090
his face,
big Duke and what the fuck are we watching?

1650
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.580
And You wonder why people who have lost their psychic abilities and all that

1651
01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:33.350
shit.
I used to think that when I was doing fear factor,

1652
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:34.820
when I was doing fear factor,
I was like,

1653
01:26:34.821 --> 01:26:37.780
we are three seasons away from the running man.
We're like right here,

1654
01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.160
we're right here.
Well the door,
they'll come,
they'll line up.

1655
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:42.770
We were doing fear factor and you know,
everybody's like,

1656
01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:46.220
well you know the shows like that man are designed by the government to keep you

1657
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:48.560
soft and no,
no,
they're not.

1658
01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.490
They're made by people because that's what people want to see.
But the,

1659
01:26:51.491 --> 01:26:52.820
even the people making them,

1660
01:26:52.821 --> 01:26:55.820
it's not like they're the grand programmers of the universe and they've done

1661
01:26:55.821 --> 01:26:59.180
this on purpose to try to lower people's standards.
No,

1662
01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:02.000
this is what you want to see,
man.
You really do want to say some dumb shit.

1663
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:04.520
It's a reflection of society.
That's what they want.
It's,

1664
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:06.230
it's a fascinating thing to be a part of too.

1665
01:27:06.231 --> 01:27:09.470
Cause when we were doing fear factor,
while we're doing it,
we were all going,

1666
01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:14.480
I think really letting us do this.
Like it was,
you know,
we'd say,
okay,
we uh,

1667
01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:17.180
we said we're going to blend rats.
What did they,
what did they say?
They said,

1668
01:27:17.181 --> 01:27:20.450
good,
we've got a green light.
They got greenlight unblending rats.
Fuck.

1669
01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.710
What about drink your own piss?
Nope.
We just got a red light.

1670
01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:26.400
Can't drink your own pets weed.
Every now and then we'll get red lights,
you know?

1671
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:31.120
Okay.
How about eat a Buffalo Dick?
I remember that.
Greenlight greenlight.

1672
01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:35.780
Buffalo Dicks.
We can eat buffalo.
Dick's.
Holy Shit.
That's funny.

1673
01:27:35.781 --> 01:27:39.020
We tell them it's buffalo dicks.
Yes.
You're allowed to tell him.
How about balls?

1674
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:42.410
Yes,
you can eat balls.
Remember we'd have boiled balls.
Oh,

1675
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:46.130
giant bull testicles with the skin on them.
All the veins around it.

1676
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:50.120
Like did you ever get sick watching them do that stuff?
Oh,
a bunch of times.

1677
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.990
I never threw up on the set.
I only threw up at home once.
I would,
funny enough,

1678
01:27:53.991 --> 01:27:58.730
I would watch that show with my nose plugs thinking like just reflects literally

1679
01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.120
watch like this.
Cause I feel like I catch a whiff of something,
you know,

1680
01:28:02.121 --> 01:28:05.600
it wasn't the most fun thing to do,
you know,
because it was really fun sometimes,

1681
01:28:05.601 --> 01:28:09.170
but other times it was fucking tedious as hell.
But looking back on it and like,

1682
01:28:09.171 --> 01:28:12.590
wow,
I was a part of some weird part of fucking television history.

1683
01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:14.330
One of the most,
you're now shows ever.

1684
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:17.210
There's nothing before after that's like it.
Oh,
sorry.

1685
01:28:17.211 --> 01:28:18.830
It was so strange to be a part of it.

1686
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.250
I was at the 99 cent store the other day and they're still sewing like fear

1687
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:26.270
factor candy.
Like that's got to show around the world still,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,

1688
01:28:26.271 --> 01:28:29.900
yeah.
I get emails from people sometimes in other countries we're just started

1689
01:28:29.901 --> 01:28:34.250
showing.
Yeah,
for real.
It just started.
Just started there.

1690
01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.500
You know they're cooked.
She says,
got it.
I know it.
That's another,

1691
01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:38.090
there's countries here just now getting like the,

1692
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:41.630
I guess apparently my sister's boyfriend is from Germany.
He was saying like,

1693
01:28:41.631 --> 01:28:46.100
you know,
they showed nightrider rider,
you know,
like now they're like,

1694
01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:49.820
because they,
David Hasselhoff,
David Hasselhoff and they pried him,

1695
01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:54.650
but they'll countries will get stuff that we are done with that wrapped in the

1696
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:58.610
90s that wrapped in the 80s but they'll think it's new as interests accordingly.

1697
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.890
Is it going weird when a comic goes to another country and becomes big in that

1698
01:29:01.891 --> 01:29:05.220
country?
Oh yeah.
That's weird.
That is right when they did.

1699
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:07.890
They're not big in America,
but they go someone that become big.
Yeah.

1700
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.710
That's really strange.
Right.
That's real weird.
Especially if it's a,

1701
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:13.920
if your native country,
you can't seem to find,

1702
01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:17.160
I mean it's different with musicians.
Hendricks did it,
you know.
Right.

1703
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.030
A few other guys,

1704
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:21.870
but they came to America and America's always been at the top of the ice cream

1705
01:29:21.871 --> 01:29:24.950
pile.
And that's where the cherry is.
There's still holes.
Yeah.
I mean it's still,

1706
01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.780
that's the grand,
you know,
the,
the,
the big stage supposedly.
Right.

1707
01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.820
But for like a lot of comics,
like going to other countries,

1708
01:29:32.821 --> 01:29:34.620
you become more successful.
You know,

1709
01:29:34.621 --> 01:29:39.390
like arch barker is gigantic in Australia to see,
oh my God dude.

1710
01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:43.010
He's like,
he's like Richard Pryor in Australia.
No bullshit man.

1711
01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:46.480
He's fucking huge.
What happened while,

1712
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:49.410
I guess he went over there and kicked ass,
want to know a bunch of tours,

1713
01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:51.420
did a bunch of tours over there and they just love him.

1714
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.430
He lives there now apparently he like,

1715
01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:57.150
you know you've got a house there and he's like fuck it comes on tour in
America.

1716
01:29:57.151 --> 01:30:00.420
But most of the time he spends in Australia sells out like you know,

1717
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:03.690
fucking 2030 nights in a row at places.
I was wondering what happened to,

1718
01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.370
cause it's like around the time like him to meet you.

1719
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:07.020
Martin started getting a lot of attention.

1720
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:08.790
That seems like one kind of went the other way.

1721
01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:11.380
Well you went to Australia and just started kicking ass for him.

1722
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.270
He said he's like the biggest comic in,
in Australia I think.
Pablo giant,

1723
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:18.840
well worldwide doesn't,
he does huge and like Finland,
he's got some,

1724
01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:20.370
some pockets of fans out there.

1725
01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:24.390
He sounds silly to you don't really have to be adept at the language to

1726
01:30:24.391 --> 01:30:25.950
understand Pablo.
Well that's the thing.

1727
01:30:25.951 --> 01:30:29.520
It's the language barrier would I think certainly it has to keep me in English

1728
01:30:29.521 --> 01:30:32.770
speaking only nations obviously and even the most,
you know,

1729
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:37.590
Americanized ones because it's like,
well a lot of Europe speaks English as well.

1730
01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.580
If they come to your show.
I've done shows in Ireland,
I've done shows,
you know,

1731
01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.610
I've done chosen uh,
a bunch of different,
I never did Germany,

1732
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:46.350
but I've done them all throughout the UK.

1733
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.520
And you get people that speak a gang of different languages and English,
French,

1734
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:52.320
English,
they speak at all.
They,

1735
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:56.490
it just seems to me like I watched a documentary with Eddie Izzard learned

1736
01:30:56.491 --> 01:31:01.290
French to do a set and France.
Whoa,
that was pretty cool.
And connected with them.

1737
01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:04.830
Not as much as he would want to,
but he learned French are now growing up a Brit,

1738
01:31:04.831 --> 01:31:06.780
he probably knew his fair share is it was good.

1739
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.550
Eddie Izzard's a bad motherfucker.

1740
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.660
I used to think he's a silly man with a dress on like when I first saw him.

1741
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:15.390
What cross dressing.
What are the,
what is it?
What kind of weird gimmick is that?

1742
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.400
Then I saw him do this one show where he went on a marathon every day for like

1743
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:22.420
30 fucking days or something crazy like that.

1744
01:31:22.421 --> 01:31:24.990
It might've been even more than 30 days.
Something nuts,
man.

1745
01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:29.410
This guy ran all the way around the UK.
Oh Wow.
Dude.
It was ridiculous.

1746
01:31:29.411 --> 01:31:32.730
And they filmed him.
They followed him around with cameras.
I mean,
he got hurt,

1747
01:31:32.731 --> 01:31:36.750
man.
His feet were fucked up and he kept Ron and his legs would not up.

1748
01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:39.800
He could barely move.
He could barely shuffle forward.
What was he kept going?

1749
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:41.580
I forget some sort of charity thing.

1750
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:44.640
I watched a documentary on him and they talked about the address,

1751
01:31:44.641 --> 01:31:46.860
the cross dressing issue,
but by the time you get done with the film,

1752
01:31:46.861 --> 01:31:48.000
he's so fascinating.

1753
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:51.120
That's just a little side thing to the point where you don't even think of it

1754
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:53.490
anymore.
You know what I mean?
He's a,
he's a bad motherfucker.

1755
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:56.190
It's really interesting too.
It's a cross dressing thing where it's like,

1756
01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.740
like guy who smoked cigarettes.
It's like I kind of need to do it.

1757
01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.010
Know that's what he's literally

1758
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.830
<v 4>like,
I need,
I have to do it.
It's not like I'm not into dudes,
nothing like that.</v>

1759
01:32:02.831 --> 01:32:06.360
I just really need to do this once a day.
And I was just like,
wow,
I can,

1760
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:07.920
that's what he would do when he would go on stage.

1761
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.520
Like he was really like that was,
he was into crossdresser.

1762
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:13.930
He's just into cross dressing.
There's no,
it wasn't a gimmick.
It's not a gimmick.

1763
01:32:13.931 --> 01:32:17.620
There is no sexual thing.
It was just some yes,
no sensual thing.

1764
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:19.330
I mean it's probably,
he says,

1765
01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:22.420
he always says right people I know he likes what he did.
He was so interesting.

1766
01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:25.590
He made you forget that he dressed like that.
Yeah.

1767
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:28.810
He's a bad motherfucker when anybody can run a marathon every day as many days

1768
01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:31.000
as he did.
It was a,
it was a ridiculous documentary.

1769
01:32:31.001 --> 01:32:33.940
I don't know why it didn't air in America cause NBC or someone should have

1770
01:32:33.941 --> 01:32:36.040
picked it up cause it was really compelling.
But it's interesting.

1771
01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:38.680
They should have eroded simultaneously.
It was a really compelling,

1772
01:32:38.681 --> 01:32:41.350
I mean if they had room for it anywhere it would have done very well because it

1773
01:32:41.351 --> 01:32:42.190
was a really gripping,

1774
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:44.770
I started it not thinking I was going to get into it at all,

1775
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:47.590
so it gives a fuck about some idiot running everywhere,
you know?
I'm like,

1776
01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.270
this is stupid,
you know,
run everywhere.

1777
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.960
But then I realized like how much he's pushing through this and doing it in

1778
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:56.620
great spirits and laughing and,
and these guys got a solid personality.

1779
01:32:56.650 --> 01:33:00.280
There's a documentary,
she'll watch it.
I watched one recently called still bill.

1780
01:33:00.281 --> 01:33:03.220
Have you heard of this one?
No.
It's a story of Bill withers.
He's a,

1781
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:04.570
he's a soul singer,

1782
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:07.330
kind of RNB guy from the 70 [inaudible] sang and wrote lean on me.

1783
01:33:07.690 --> 01:33:09.510
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone to him.

1784
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.820
But this guy didn't pick up a guitar or sing or learn to do any of it until he

1785
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:16.420
was 32 years old.
Holy Shit.
You want to talk about natural ability?

1786
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:21.010
This guy picks it up when he's 32 rights.
Lean on me.
Below is up.

1787
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.000
Leaves the music business like 10 years after being in it sometime around the

1788
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.570
late seventies just had enough and just collects his royalties and mind you,

1789
01:33:28.571 --> 01:33:32.020
it makes a ton of money.
He's the nicest,
most decent person you ever saw.

1790
01:33:32.021 --> 01:33:33.520
He's from a slab fork.

1791
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:37.600
West Virginia has this real country way of living but lives up in the Hollywood

1792
01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:41.320
hills.
But you talk to this guy,
he's the most lovable guy in the world.

1793
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:43.610
Like I say,
it doesn't have to do anything.
He smoked,

1794
01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:45.450
but you know the whole thing is he's,

1795
01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.740
people have been begging him to come do tracks,

1796
01:33:47.741 --> 01:33:50.020
come back into the music industry for years and at the end,

1797
01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:50.990
I won't tell you what happened.

1798
01:33:50.991 --> 01:33:53.350
Somebody begged him to come back and it's just like,

1799
01:33:53.351 --> 01:33:57.370
it just shows this guy who is a Chris Brown.
No,
it's nothing like that.

1800
01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.670
Thank God I would've,
I would've never had said that.
I hate that guy.

1801
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.380
I feel bad for him.
Who is that?
Chris Brown.
Yeah.
I feel bad for him being him.

1802
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.400
Yeah,
that's,
he hates being him.
You can,
it's a hard person to being,
man.

1803
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:12.580
He's a mess.
You can tell that guy has no,
you can see it in his,

1804
01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.050
came back and wrote a song and it was horrible.
I can't tell you that.

1805
01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:19.600
You got to watch it still bill.
But it still bill still bill.

1806
01:34:19.601 --> 01:34:23.530
One of the best documentaries I've seen in a per Bobby Lee's recommendation.

1807
01:34:23.531 --> 01:34:24.580
Funny enough.
Wow.

1808
01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.950
And not funny enough because sometimes he recommends really good stuff,

1809
01:34:26.951 --> 01:34:28.480
but other times he recommends horrible.

1810
01:34:28.481 --> 01:34:32.620
It's the worst thing he's ever recommended.
Uh,
the,
the um,
the,
what you call it,

1811
01:34:32.621 --> 01:34:37.060
movie with a River Phoenix.
His brother.
Uh Oh yeah,

1812
01:34:37.061 --> 01:34:39.480
I heard that was terrible.
It was awful.
He thought it was brilliant.

1813
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:44.770
It's fucking brilliant.
Fucking brilliant.

1814
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:49.250
It's brilliant.
It wasn't brilliant.
A lot of his stuff he bought forgot.

1815
01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:53.650
Did you impressions Bobby's in the good,
pretty good movies.
And you do Bobby Lee.

1816
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.980
Can you do,
I can do fucking Bobby Lee.
That's,

1817
01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:00.920
he is been a fucking bomb.
Joe Rogan.
I'm gonna fucking bomb.

1818
01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:05.360
And they walked down pretty close.
Yeah.
Close as much as he can.
Jesse Ventura,

1819
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:10.450
Jesse,
the body been Torah.
That's now it's Jessie the mine.
Ventura.
That's,

1820
01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:14.450
come on Joe.
Rogan's podcast to talk dot truth.
Yeah,

1821
01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:18.850
I think that's pretty good.
Damn good.
I've never done that before.
I'm nine.

1822
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:23.420
One one was an inside job.
If you think the latter,

1823
01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:25.700
you're the one who's missing four brother.

1824
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:30.770
You don't think that Rumsfeld knew what we was doing when he told those troops

1825
01:35:30.771 --> 01:35:32.180
to stand down?

1826
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:37.670
Niche almost sounds a little Sam Elliott in there too.
That a little bit.

1827
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:42.200
Raj Rail.
You don't get any roadhouse quotes in.

1828
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:47.180
You show that man to the door and if he doesn't go quietly,

1829
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.420
what does it use this drug and head and buy yourself a dodge ram pickup with all

1830
01:35:53.361 --> 01:35:56.390
the torque and you definitely know how to stretch his words out.

1831
01:35:56.391 --> 01:36:00.800
The waist turns his words and rocky get on the bike.
Rocky.
Rocky.
Dennis,

1832
01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:04.960
what was that thing you did about ice,
tea and cocoa?
What did you do recently?
Oh,

1833
01:36:04.961 --> 01:36:09.000
uh,
what w police show St Tripoli show.
Uh,

1834
01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:13.250
maybe ball baby pool.
Yeah,
we did a ice t commercial with,

1835
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:18.090
with a coco.
A great cocoa look alike.
My Maya,
did she look just like,
oh,

1836
01:36:18.091 --> 01:36:21.200
go for it.
She was built like her.
She was an anomaly,
like this huge ass,

1837
01:36:21.201 --> 01:36:24.140
huge boobs and there's tiny waist.
Now granted it was all sculpted that way,

1838
01:36:24.141 --> 01:36:27.740
but it was still this anomaly.
It was like,
whoa.
It was ridiculous.

1839
01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:31.220
Sculptor meaning like operations,
operations at top.

1840
01:36:31.221 --> 01:36:34.040
I've heard people seen that Coco and my wife said she's absolutely beautiful.

1841
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:39.020
I um,
but uh,
yeah,
we did the ice tea thing.
We did the baby bull man.

1842
01:36:39.021 --> 01:36:42.980
That went over pretty well and he saw a red band tweeted it and ice tea tweeted

1843
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:47.390
back.
What did he,
what did he say?
I said a,
uh,
I made a video.

1844
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:50.560
What do you think about this?
And he'd say,
it's interesting.

1845
01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:54.860
I say it's interesting.
Yeah,
that's pretty God damn good ice tea.

1846
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:58.580
That's that I that man that's dead.
That's 100%.

1847
01:36:58.650 --> 01:37:01.610
And I'm fighting off a cold from the past three days.

1848
01:37:01.611 --> 01:37:03.770
Sometimes I want to have a cold.
My impressions to get a little better.

1849
01:37:03.771 --> 01:37:07.140
Like I've never done that Ventura one before.
I didn't know if you could do it.

1850
01:37:07.150 --> 01:37:09.030
You do a good bro call.
I left on good.

1851
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:10.980
<v 5>Oh Amy,
I'm heartbroken.</v>

1852
01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.610
Sugars,
bombs are falling and draw all of I
did.

1853
01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:22.250
You know Tom Brokaw was a pothead 24 hour a day.
Paul is he really prideful pot?

1854
01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.040
Perry.
I take pong reps on a daily

1855
01:37:28.410 --> 01:37:32.870
daily smoking indycar sativa makes me not want to do my God.

1856
01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.680
<v 4>That's hilarious.
That's so good guy nuts.
He really does smoke pot.</v>

1857
01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.680
Where'd you hear this?
You know,
I read it somewhere and I just ran with it.

1858
01:37:42.681 --> 01:37:47.370
I didn't research it.
Just yeah.
Say Tom.
Uh,

1859
01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:52.060
Tom.
Tom Parker.
How do you spell bro?
Call Br.

1860
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:55.070
Okay.
That's boy.

1861
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:59.750
Ocean saw a family guy last night where there was a gang of Bro.

1862
01:37:59.751 --> 01:38:04.280
Cause there's like 12 of them.
No,
I never did it.
Not Interested.
Where did,

1863
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.390
he was like experimented with a little marijuana.

1864
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.540
I never liked a lot of other people.
You just made up some shit.

1865
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:12.700
Somebody made it up and I wanted to believe it.
Okay.
We'll give you too.

1866
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:17.160
I wish I didn't Google it.
Alright.
Who else,
who's confirming says is there,

1867
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:18.320
is there some clearinghouse of,

1868
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:22.980
of whether a celebrity is a pothead or not and broke off Alfie 10 posts.

1869
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.560
If it's a topic and working on a John Lithgow as well.

1870
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:28.920
My girlfriend doesn't like it,
but I do actually.
She does like it.

1871
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:33.690
Hello decks to move women.
Can you do Nancy Grace?
She's my favorite.
Nancy grace.

1872
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:37.010
This is a real problem.
Yeah.

1873
01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.730
La uh,
babies in Florida.

1874
01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:46.890
We are alive right now.
Who?
Me?
Yeah.
Oh,

1875
01:38:46.891 --> 01:38:49.710
there was a good march.
Was that all the other one that you do?
That's amazing.

1876
01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:53.220
Is Morgan Freeman,
isn't it?
It Morgan Freon.
That's ridiculous.

1877
01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:57.330
I need to fray Andy to frighten.
Gave me hand jobs those last few nights.

1878
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:58.500
Talking about your penis,
Morgan.

1879
01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.790
My penis hangs down to my knee caps and I'm wearing knickerbockers shorts.

1880
01:39:02.791 --> 01:39:03.624
You can tell

1881
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:10.440
show why not do lean on me.
Quotes what you get in that.
Lock us on Bob Future.

1882
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:14.470
All right now.
And then I take quotes from,

1883
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:16.560
from lean on me and I changed them around like,
and lean on me.

1884
01:39:16.561 --> 01:39:19.380
There's this kid he keeps asking cause this kids like,
Yo,
Mr Clock,
man,

1885
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.510

I'm gonna go make money.
He's like,

1886
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:23.730
you'll be dead in a year.
So he's like,

1887
01:39:23.731 --> 01:39:26.210
I'm going to go work for my uncle.
But you dead in the year to be in a,

1888
01:39:26.211 --> 01:39:29.850

1890
01:39:32.941 --> 01:39:34.860
He'll be dead in a yes.
Well fuck you.

1891
01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:38.940
Then Clark Joe did a ice cube thing the other day and we were in the green room

1892
01:39:38.941 --> 01:39:42.950
baked as hell and we saw this commercial for a Sitcom for ice cubes.
New sitcoms.

1893
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.370
Are we there yet?
Really?
Damn.
Why you kids make all this noise?

1894
01:39:48.210 --> 01:39:52.890
I pick up little Chris and put them on the porch.
Are Ours cubes terrible.

1895
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:56.160
It's hard.
That's telling.
You know I saw him in concert reason kids.

1896
01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.280
Oh I'm in concert kappa rule about me.

1897
01:39:59.281 --> 01:40:01.860
The ticket we went to go see him and he didn't do anything off death
certificate.

1898
01:40:01.861 --> 01:40:04.710
The album I grew up loving that I haven't changed my why not allowed to.

1899
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.240
What did he do fresh out of school?

1900
01:40:06.241 --> 01:40:08.940
Cause I was a high school Grad so there's a little askew.
I got it there.

1901
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:09.880
What did he do?
Uh,

1902
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:14.640
stuff from post 98 I hadn't listened to anything ice cube since 95 so it was one

1903
01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:15.474
of the new shit.

1904
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.630
I guess he still makes new shit and then he brought his son out like I want to

1905
01:40:18.631 --> 01:40:21.750
hear it.
His son and her trials and tribulations though.
His son,
he has two sons.

1906
01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:24.630
One looks just like him from 1987 really the thing is it's like,

1907
01:40:24.631 --> 01:40:26.520
that's the thing with second generation hip hop dude.

1908
01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:27.960
You'd better come seriously correct.

1909
01:40:27.961 --> 01:40:32.010
Cause hip hop's born in poverty and thrives and struggle and second generation

1910
01:40:32.011 --> 01:40:34.530
of hip hop.
I don't mind a rich rapper who became rich on his own,

1911
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.750
but the second generation thing,
you know,
it's hard.
Harvard Westlake a lot,

1912
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.240
da homie.
You know it doesn't,
it was,
yeah,

1913
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:44.700
I'm sure he still had to grow up having ice cube as a father,

1914
01:40:44.710 --> 01:40:47.130
which fucked all right.
Ice Cube.
I'll tell you this.

1915
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:50.880
At the age of 17 moved to Arizona and went to a trade school and studied

1916
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:55.510
architecture before founding Nwa.
Check on that.
O'Shea Jackson,

1917
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.360
his name is.
Wow.
So how w what does this kid,

1918
01:40:58.361 --> 01:41:01.510
this kid goes up and wrap comes up and perhaps about hard times.
Joe Rogan,

1919
01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:04.660
I heard he's hard.
Tom Or Tom's?
Joe Rogan.
I heard it was good though.

1920
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:08.050
I heard he was,
he was good.
He's got that booming voice like ice cube has.

1921
01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:10.240
What does he say about the hard times?
I don't even remember.

1922
01:41:10.241 --> 01:41:12.550
I just wanted to leave so bad.
By the time it was over,

1923
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:14.740
it was at the House of Blues.
You not the last time I was at the House of Blues.

1924
01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:19.120
I saw you there and you ran into me cause we went to chewy show.
Why we did that.

1925
01:41:19.121 --> 01:41:22.660
I don't know was what it was.
2001 two maybe something like that.

1926
01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:25.660
And then when you've gotten the chewy good dude too good.

1927
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.870
I'm going to the house of blues,
Bro.
You've got to come today.
He's a crazy guy.

1928
01:41:29.871 --> 01:41:31.750
And as a bouncer,
he wasn't your favorite guy,

1929
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.490
but as a band member and that was pretty good.
He was good man.
It was weird.

1930
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.630
It was like chewy was the doorman at the comedy store.
Like fucking forever.
Yeah.

1931
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:43.840
But he was a nice guy.
I mean he was,
he had a like you to be a nice guy.

1932
01:41:43.841 --> 01:41:45.550
He liked I me luckily.
Thank God I've seen what,

1933
01:41:45.551 --> 01:41:48.910
he didn't listen like you became a real problem and he always liked me and uh,

1934
01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.810
he,
I even introduced him one time.
I introduced him one time at the house blows.

1935
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:57.760
Oh yeah.
They're fucking good man.
He's real good.
Chewy Castro.

1936
01:41:57.761 --> 01:42:01.510
And what was the band called?
Shui and the uh,
I don't know.
I remember the song.

1937
01:42:01.511 --> 01:42:06.460
Hey chewy.
It was,
well,
yeah.
Hey,
Julie is going to play with me Bro.
Yeah,

1938
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:08.260
I remember that rejects just to come jam with them.

1939
01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.840
Vick changes to go on stage with Chile.
Really?

1940
01:42:10.841 --> 01:42:14.710
And this was back before Rick James was like immortalized by Dave Chappelle.

1941
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:18.610
Yeah.
This was 2000 2001 yeah.
Rick James was like,
you know,

1942
01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.880
people like didn't care that much that he was there after the Dave Chappelle

1943
01:42:21.881 --> 01:42:25.510
sketches.
If you went on stage,
they would have gone Corey.
Right.
But this was,

1944
01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:29.410
I mean,
obviously it was dead,
you know,
but this was a 2001 or so.

1945
01:42:29.411 --> 01:42:31.810
He would go on dude,
Chili's bad.

1946
01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:35.530
It was real weird to know someone from work and then you know,
they say,
hey,

1947
01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:38.560
we come see my band.
I'm like,
Oh God,
here we go.
Here we go.
But you know,

1948
01:42:38.561 --> 01:42:41.910
I mean you didn't really expect your much astro and like the notes,

1949
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:45.430
the notes get what the fuck they were.
Yes.
Somebody can find that.

1950
01:42:45.431 --> 01:42:48.620
True cast is also the bad guy in James Bond,
right?
Sure.

1951
01:42:48.621 --> 01:42:50.920
He Castro don't dressed up like that guy.

1952
01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:55.960
Cut your head off that he's dressed like that.

1953
01:42:55.961 --> 01:43:00.040
Or like somebody from a clockwork orange or somebody who works at her money with

1954
01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:03.730
his hat.
Remember we would like hit sculptures and shit and knock arms off.

1955
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:07.320
It's fucking stupid hat of it.
Sure,
we can do that.
Well,
Cheerios,

1956
01:43:07.321 --> 01:43:10.620
they had a side job there.
I forgot what it was.
Great.
Lowbrow shape.

1957
01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:14.530
How many interesting people have you met out of the Goddamn comedy store that is

1958
01:43:14.531 --> 01:43:18.550
like a,
uh,
a whirlpool.
It's sucks.
All the Weirdos right to it.

1959
01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.860
It's the overlook hotel from the shining man.
It's just,
it is.

1960
01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.290
It's a vortex for the Weirdos.
And have you ever met Mickey Biggie?

1961
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:31.810
Ah,
it's a guy who's literally so funny to watch because he's so crazy,

1962
01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:33.160
but he's the most like,

1963
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:36.160
it's funny to watch somebody interact with them like a customer Khan.
He's not,

1964
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:37.810
he's just some dude who hangs out there,
but they're like,

1965
01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:39.970
it's their bathrooms here.
He'd be like,
ah,

1966
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.840
like the most difficult person you could ever run into if you just want basic

1967
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:47.470
information as a new guy.
No,
he's been there since they got the tinted glasses.

1968
01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:52.190
Glasses,
mustache.
He's 77.
He's been hanging out apparently is a trust fund guy.

1969
01:43:52.191 --> 01:43:53.810
He's a mystery don guys.
And He,

1970
01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:57.360
I think he wasn't deemed on guy for a little while,
but tried to avoid that.
Um,

1971
01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.810
John Barris freaked me out with all those people had been rough.

1972
01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.480
There was some amazing characters in that stuff though,
that,

1973
01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:05.840
that Mickey's one of them is there no greater master of nuts.

1974
01:44:05.841 --> 01:44:09.830
Then dawn does ringleader.
We just had one death squad,
man.

1975
01:44:09.831 --> 01:44:12.800
He was talking about the old days when a comedy store was in a basement of a

1976
01:44:12.801 --> 01:44:16.200
restaurant.
Oh,
that was the Westwood version.
Yeah,

1977
01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.530
that was the word Kennison used to rock out.
Yeah.

1978
01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.810
He's talking about Kennison and how there was a bullet hole.

1979
01:44:20.811 --> 01:44:25.250
I didn't know this and the belly room and the sign of the bill that he pulled

1980
01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:28.130
out.
I think it was about him and dice being mad at each other.
Wow.

1981
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:32.560
Kinison pulled out a gun and shot a fucking side.
That's craziness.

1982
01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.820
It was pretty interesting.
Podcasts.
Yeah,
that's a,

1983
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:37.940
you know who else has a great ruler over the craziest as Ricky room?

1984
01:44:37.941 --> 01:44:39.650
He always has.
They always worship him.

1985
01:44:39.651 --> 01:44:43.430
It's so funny like how he's got that power of the crazy or they are,

1986
01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:44.720
the more they confide in him,

1987
01:44:44.721 --> 01:44:47.240
which is so funny cause he's the most cynical mother fucker on her.

1988
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:49.640
You know what I mean?
He just makes fun of him right to their face.
They're like,

1989
01:44:49.641 --> 01:44:51.620
oh,
I love you Rick.
You're always good.
To me.

1990
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:57.140
It's like now that we're know weird people in Hollywood trying to be seen,

1991
01:44:57.141 --> 01:45:00.920
trying to be her,
trying to be found.
Find me.

1992
01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.410
What a weird,
creepy place to live.

1993
01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.360
Let's do you ever think you'd ever moving out of here?

1994
01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:09.980
Are you going to stay here forever?
If I did,
I moved to New York.
Basically.

1995
01:45:09.981 --> 01:45:12.830
I could live in New York.
I can live in la,
but I want like to have a uh,

1996
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:16.130
somewhere in Montana and I want to go fly fishing and just be left the hell

1997
01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:18.830
alone.
That's what I'm talking about.
Dogs.
I go,
let's go.

1998
01:45:18.831 --> 01:45:23.480
Often we keep saying this man,
let's go fish.
It's a spring.
Let's go fishing.

1999
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:25.250
We should've done,
we were in Portland.

2000
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.940
We should have stayed an extra day and went salmon fishing on Catalina island.

2001
01:45:28.941 --> 01:45:32.810
Is their fishing there.
It's ocean.
Now.
Watch the urban fishermen.

2002
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:35.800
This guy will show you where to fish and your city,
dude,
I'm a huge fan.

2003
01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.810
I saw that show.
What is,
what is that on fishermen?
This guy.

2004
01:45:38.811 --> 01:45:41.960
He's the one that hunting shows.
Uh,
it's hunting.
Fishing.
No,

2005
01:45:41.961 --> 01:45:44.600
it's actually like on travel,
I think.
And it's,
that guy's a,

2006
01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:48.510
I can la Ross or somebody,
I can Ellie or something.
His last name is,
and he,

2007
01:45:48.511 --> 01:45:51.410
she does urban fishing.
He'll catch fish in the Hudson river.
You'll catch fish,

2008
01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.050
you know?
No,
he doesn't eat him.
He's a sport fisherman.

2009
01:45:54.051 --> 01:45:56.420
So he tosses them all back.
But he'll show you,
if you live in a big city,

2010
01:45:56.421 --> 01:45:59.300
you can still find great fishing.
I fished three times a month,
you know,

2011
01:45:59.301 --> 01:46:03.560
it'd be cool.
Yeah.
When you guys go to Arizona a lot.
I go fly fishing.

2012
01:46:03.561 --> 01:46:04.341
I go bass fishing.

2013
01:46:04.341 --> 01:46:07.600
Me and my buddy Scotty g two the past fishing at Dobson ranch park.
Dude,

2014
01:46:07.610 --> 01:46:08.660
just throw him all day.

2015
01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.960
I caught a catfish at night waiting for my breaks to be done.
I was like,

2016
01:46:11.961 --> 01:46:15.000
I'm gonna go next door.
Catch a catfish.
Come back.
Did I got an emergency pole?

2017
01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:18.380
And there was this,
this was in Arizona.
In Arizona,
but not out here.
You know,

2018
01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:19.810
I catch,
I've got to do it out here too.

2019
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.610
Where do you go fishing at the Santa Monica pier and fish without a license.

2020
01:46:22.611 --> 01:46:25.010
You can pitch it anywhere.
Yeah.
And the ocean.
You can fish it.

2021
01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:27.730
Our license without a license on the Santa Monica Pier.
You can fish.
Yeah.

2022
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:31.820
How come?
Um,
I think it's kind of no man's land.
They can't really govern it.

2023
01:46:31.821 --> 01:46:32.421
You don't really need it.

2024
01:46:32.421 --> 01:46:35.720
I don't think you need a license to Ohsu Ocean fish at all.
Yeah,

2025
01:46:35.721 --> 01:46:36.351
I think you don't,

2026
01:46:36.351 --> 01:46:38.960
I think it's fresh water that you need all this fresh water and it's all like,

2027
01:46:38.961 --> 01:46:40.010
it's all that urban stuff.

2028
01:46:40.011 --> 01:46:42.740
You have to get that local urban license and then you have to get the lake

2029
01:46:42.741 --> 01:46:47.310
license.
But uh,
I,
I fish any chance I get,
it's so much like comedy,
it's just,

2030
01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:50.070
it's a patience game.
It's fun winning.
You get good at it.
You

2031
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.920
<v 1>get,
I'm not good at it.
I just do it a lot.
But I'm getting better.</v>

2032
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:55.590
I used to fish all the time when I was living in Jamaica Plain.

2033
01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:59.400
I used to go to Jamaica pawn and catch big ass fucking rainbow trout.
Yeah.

2034
01:46:59.401 --> 01:47:02.180
We catch a lot of fish there,
man.
And there was a lake there.

2035
01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:04.890
Massachusetts is great because there was a lot of different places to fish when

2036
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:07.800
I was a kid.
But uh,
there was a lake near my house in Newton.

2037
01:47:07.801 --> 01:47:10.440
I caught a three pound bass and it's at a tiny ass pond,

2038
01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.010
so big ass fucking dominating shit.
And this pond,

2039
01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.670
I think swimming and fishing with sounds so good together.
Just hanging out.

2040
01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:21.900
I'd get knocked out by my own bay and I use Louis.
I'd have a top water hook.

2041
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:25.350
I'd be afraid of it,
you know what I mean?
And I've gotten into Lewis now,

2042
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:28.530
like as a kid I was always live bait,
but now I'm in the Lewis,
the sport,

2043
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:32.700
the art of fishing and I got into fly fishing recently.
That some cool shit,
dude.

2044
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:34.800
I used to low good at catching.
Oh awesome.

2045
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.210
I used to love catching bass on floating rapalas cast him out.

2046
01:47:39.211 --> 01:47:40.940
Then just twitch it a little bit like a,

2047
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:44.410
like a little fish that's fucked up ass her like torpedoes and no matter how
old,

2048
01:47:44.411 --> 01:47:46.590
that fucking thing,
like they couldn't,
they couldn't not hit it.

2049
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.040
Did you want to catch bass?
Two spoons?
That's the best way,

2050
01:47:50.041 --> 01:47:52.950
spoons or silver things,
they'll click dying minnows against the stream.

2051
01:47:52.951 --> 01:47:54.570
That was the coolest thing about fishing when I was a kid.

2052
01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:58.650
You never knew what the fuck they wanted that day.
One day it was plastic worms.

2053
01:47:58.651 --> 01:48:01.700
The next day was spinner baits and there's all different things to catch him

2054
01:48:01.701 --> 01:48:04.830
with or they're smarter and wiser to some of you,
be efficient with somebody,

2055
01:48:04.831 --> 01:48:05.600
like what did he use?

2056
01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.810
And he caught something and you'd lose all confidence in what you had on that

2057
01:48:08.811 --> 01:48:11.700
damn.
And I need to get one of those.
We go to this place.
Uh,
my buddy,

2058
01:48:11.701 --> 01:48:14.510
one of the places I go with,
my mom lives next door to a lake.
Uh,

2059
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:17.220
just one of these community likes.
I go fish,
tear polecat fish out of there.

2060
01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:19.320
I go to my buddy Scott McWilliam lives in tops and rant.

2061
01:48:19.321 --> 01:48:21.120
It's like four feet deep.
This water,

2062
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:25.170
we take his dad's pontoon smoke balls and fucking fit the whole time.

2063
01:48:25.210 --> 01:48:29.730
Like just smoking bowls.
Fish sounds fun in the sun too.
It's,
it's the best time,

2064
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:33.420
man.
I like fishing is has given me in my thirties this whole new,

2065
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:37.590
it exercises the patients like I've got a lot more patients now.

2066
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.700
There's something more visceral about hooking a big fish too,
man.
You know,

2067
01:48:41.701 --> 01:48:45.760
it's like there's something,
it just goes,
it charges up some caveman instinction.

2068
01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.520
You know,
you,
you won that day,
you know,
you won that day.
And I,

2069
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:53.430
I've been places where it's like,
you know,
there's big whales swimming by,

2070
01:48:53.431 --> 01:48:55.860
they're not by nothing.
But then there's other nights where it's like,
you know,

2071
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:57.960
you,
I was at my mom's house one night.
I said,

2072
01:48:57.961 --> 01:49:01.020
I'm going to catch a fucking fish right now,
and I'm taking hot dog with me.

2073
01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:03.360
That's how pathetic this is.
But they know the cat first.

2074
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:05.190
They're fucking lake roaches.
They'll eat anything.

2075
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:08.490
Throw the con chum the water with a little corn.
Sure enough,

2076
01:49:08.491 --> 01:49:12.210
two seconds later I had a bite on that hot dog.
I used to use a chicken liver,

2077
01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:15.540
used to buy chicken over a store near my grandfathers,
used to take me in Newark,

2078
01:49:15.541 --> 01:49:16.071
New Jersey,

2079
01:49:16.071 --> 01:49:19.380
which is going to take me to some fucking lake and we'd go fishing like late at

2080
01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:21.840
night.
It was so shifty back then too.
It was like so dangerous.

2081
01:49:21.841 --> 01:49:24.540
I'm hearing my old grandfather and it's late at night because that's when we

2082
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:25.374
would catch the catfish.

2083
01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.830
So he took me to some creepy ass neighborhood late at night to catch fish

2084
01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:34.530
casting out liver into this lake.
I am pulled a 10 pound channel catfish.
Oh Wow.

2085
01:49:34.531 --> 01:49:38.650
All Brown and like a mud cats is crazy man.
I do that.

2086
01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:41.490
I go fishing anywhere.
I think you might be able to go to echo park.

2087
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:42.960
I don't know if anybody's pull anything out of there.

2088
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:47.170
I never eat that little pond over here in Calabasas down.
You know,

2089
01:49:47.190 --> 01:49:48.090
it's like in the middle.

2090
01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.670
<v 4>I know what you're talking about.
Toluca lake.
I think there's nothing in there.</v>

2091
01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:56.320
There's another place.
Uh,
there's um,
a lake,
a lake,
a shit.

2092
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:59.620
Forgot the name of it.
Lake Arrowhead.
No,
that's the place.

2093
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:02.290
Lake Arrowhead is a big bear,
right?
Yeah,
that's a,
that's what,

2094
01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:05.230
that's one of the big ones.
Like are you talking to those places?

2095
01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:07.630
Like imagine living like right there,
like right on the lake.

2096
01:50:07.631 --> 01:50:11.110
I get big bear lake arrowhead as the fishing.

2097
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:14.080
Like I don't go and get upset if I don't catch like it's being out there.

2098
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:16.840
It's the smell.
It's the stillness.
I want to go canoeing.

2099
01:50:16.841 --> 01:50:21.340
Have you guys ever used to go canoeing?
Canoeing seems ridiculous.
Fun Man.

2100
01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:25.720
Going into a little lake.
Yes.
Whitewater rafting.

2101
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:29.710
Whitewater go fishing out of a canoe,
but I usually just wade.

2102
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:34.120
I like where they drop you off in the car and you go for like,
I don't know,

2103
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:38.740
like three hours and then there's a pickup point near the end journey.

2104
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.240
Did you go uh,
Ohio?
It's all over you.

2105
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:46.210
There's like Kevin Bacon and Whitewater summer.
Yeah,
but it used to be so fine.

2106
01:50:46.211 --> 01:50:48.790
It wasn't Whitewater rafting,
but there was parts where it was like,
oh,

2107
01:50:48.791 --> 01:50:52.300
here's some rapids.
The whole thing on the buying a shitload a beer and drinking.

2108
01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:57.010
We should go out on a boat in a lake is the ship.
I got Shilhan relaxing,

2109
01:50:57.011 --> 01:51:00.580
floating on that boat to find nature by being out there in the first place.

2110
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:04.540
I do ocean fishing once a year with my dad and we'll go off in Sonata and we'll

2111
01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:07.420
do a day trip.
And that's fun cause that's hardcore sport fishing.

2112
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:09.160
You're pulling out Marlin tuna,
you know,

2113
01:51:09.161 --> 01:51:12.400
you name it macro 50 pounds like you're worn out by the end of the day.

2114
01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.630
But lately I've gone back to the freshwater fishing of just chilling out there,

2115
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:17.710
making some dogs.

2116
01:51:17.711 --> 01:51:20.950
I get really nasty when people come to try to talk to who they played back off.

2117
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:24.250
I'm out here alone,
you know?
Yes.
I am serious.
Upbeat it bro.
I didn't come from,

2118
01:51:24.251 --> 01:51:26.690
it is annoying when someone wants stop talking.
I don't mind that.

2119
01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:29.830
The common fishing questions,
hey,
how the and what are you using?

2120
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:32.620
Then beat it but not like don't drop a chair bro.

2121
01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.450
I left the city to get away from you.

2122
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.140
Some people would just sit in and talk to you.
Yeah,
my girlfriend,

2123
01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:41.440
she's all mad at me wrong.
I hope you have face age.

2124
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:43.900
Let me fish in.
The ocean.
Vision is pretty dope,

2125
01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:46.660
but there's something about like still water,
like when you,

2126
01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:51.400
especially with a top Waterloo are or a fly,
he cast a flung and still watering.

2127
01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:54.220
Just give it a little twitch and that the trout comes up and blast it and you're

2128
01:51:54.221 --> 01:51:58.150
like,
Oh yeah,
I love that Shit.
We should go man.
Let's go fishing.
Let's do it.

2129
01:51:58.210 --> 01:51:58.780
Let's do it.

2130
01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.630
I've been wanting to go hunting for a long time and I'd set it on my message

2131
01:52:01.631 --> 01:52:06.160
board.
All these fucking heavy Egan,
fucking Weirdo Hippie dudes wigged out.

2132
01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:09.740
You ever get to one thing you would if you had to eat fat?
Eat.
Yeah,

2133
01:52:09.741 --> 01:52:12.690
but I don't want to go.
If you were living on a ranch and there was some fucker,

2134
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:16.590
don't be a Dick Hunter hot.
Dress it and use every possible.

2135
01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.720
I'll do the bird shit.
Hunting ducks and shit.
Fuck that.

2136
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:22.630
But I used to hunt as a kid.
I used to shoot.
Thanks.
I just got sick of it.

2137
01:52:22.631 --> 01:52:25.030
I saw a rabbit out in your front yard.
My mind was like,

2138
01:52:25.031 --> 01:52:27.880
where's my red Ryder baby last him,
but I was letting you eat them.

2139
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:32.900
How good is rabbit a pretty Gamey,
pretty lean,
you know,
uh,

2140
01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:35.350
if you've figured it's like venison when you eat that kind of stuff and he kind

2141
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:40.351
of fast moving animal is always going to be very tough if you make a stew or

2142
01:52:40.931 --> 01:52:41.764
something like that,

2143
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:46.880
three or four days and then ended up making like a stew three or four days.

2144
01:52:47.530 --> 01:52:51.050
Really when you sit in there and just throw the bunny in the crock pot field,

2145
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:53.720
dress it,
throw it right in there in the fridge and let it sit in that stuff.

2146
01:52:53.721 --> 01:52:54.680
It was Jack Rabbit,

2147
01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.950
same subject came up yesterday when I was on the Adam Carolla show.

2148
01:52:57.951 --> 01:52:58.820
We were talking about,
you know,

2149
01:52:58.821 --> 01:53:01.910
cooking your own food and hunting and gathering your own food and how some

2150
01:53:01.911 --> 01:53:04.550
people are so opposed to it even though they eat meat.

2151
01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:09.590
We were so weird as human beings when this weird stage of,
you know,

2152
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:13.580
getting past,
being an animal and all this shit that's connected to be an animal,

2153
01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:15.560
like you know,
killing food and you know,

2154
01:53:15.561 --> 01:53:18.570
and it causing suffering in order so that you survive.

2155
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:21.350
We're so separated ourselves from all that shit.

2156
01:53:21.351 --> 01:53:26.351
It's like we've become some weird thing outside of nature connects to nature.

2157
01:53:27.141 --> 01:53:30.890
We have like agents that do the nature thing for us.
That's true.
You know,

2158
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:34.760
it's very strange now these documentaries on exposing how your meat is made.

2159
01:53:34.761 --> 01:53:37.610
I've watched everybody and it's just like,
wow,
okay,

2160
01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:40.690
but I still got to eat meat because I get it,
but I won't eat that kind of meat.

2161
01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:44.210
Like now I get the whole purpose of going to a ranch and buying fresh farm shit.

2162
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:47.960
Hey taco bell the other day and I knew that that study that it's not even meet,

2163
01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:50.690
but I still ate it.
What does it,
what does it fillers?

2164
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:53.870
They said it's full as glass cardboard or something.
You know,
the thing is,

2165
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:56.690
it's like I don't eat the fast food,
but it's like I would like,

2166
01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:01.220
I would be a hunter if I lived out on in Montana and I would feel dressed it and

2167
01:54:01.221 --> 01:54:04.190
use every part the right way,
like a real hunter does.

2168
01:54:04.191 --> 01:54:06.110
I have nothing against that.
Right.
You know what I mean?

2169
01:54:06.111 --> 01:54:09.350
I'm not doing drive bys on fucking deer and just leaving them out there.

2170
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:11.630
But the thing is use it,
right.
I'm all for it.

2171
01:54:11.631 --> 01:54:14.300
You really do have to kill them and people need to wrap their heads around that

2172
01:54:14.301 --> 01:54:16.790
because otherwise you're going to have a massive amount of predators and

2173
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:19.870
starvation hunting keeps the population go to West Virginia.

2174
01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:23.380
Go to these places where they're like,
fuck deer,
buck deer.
You know,

2175
01:54:23.710 --> 01:54:27.890
wait for hunting season to come.
Well,
in Colorado,
man,
you,
you have to,

2176
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:31.190
you have to be careful everywhere you drive.
Especially when a in boulder,

2177
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:34.000
because in boulder don't,
no one shoots him and they're in the mountains.
No.

2178
01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.320
So you know,
you're in a town,
so no one's shooting these deer.

2179
01:54:36.321 --> 01:54:39.050
So they're fucking everywhere.
And everywhere you go,

2180
01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:41.780
you've got to make sure some asshole dear doesn't jump out in front of the road

2181
01:54:41.781 --> 01:54:43.700
and slam into your car.
You ever been to Alaska?

2182
01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:47.960
Had that happen with the Moose there?
Oh,
praise God.
That's what moves everywhere.

2183
01:54:47.961 --> 01:54:48.860
And it's like,
sure enough,

2184
01:54:48.861 --> 01:54:51.460
one was standing in the road when we're leaving to go to the airport at

2185
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:54.110
dangerous.
Well,
the Danes,
they're not,
they won't attack you,

2186
01:54:54.111 --> 01:54:58.430
but they're so tall that their knees or at your basically top of your car,

2187
01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.170
so when you hit them,
you're going to bring this,
you know,

2188
01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:04.040
2000 pounds is going to come rushing in,
right near windshield.

2189
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:06.020
They're perfectly set up to come in and kill you.

2190
01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.140
And that's what happens is they come in and just,

2191
01:55:08.630 --> 01:55:11.570
you hit them and they fall into the cab of your call and you just get crushed.

2192
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:16.430
Enormous man.
It's like before falling on you.
Yeah.
They're massive animals.

2193
01:55:16.431 --> 01:55:18.590
I mean,
they're,
they're territorial.
They'll come after you if they have to,

2194
01:55:18.591 --> 01:55:21.260
but they're like deer.
A deer will fuck you up if it has to,

2195
01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.870
but nine times out of 10 it will just bail.
Yeah.

2196
01:55:23.871 --> 01:55:27.200
Do they have like special bumpers that they put on trucks and shit out there to

2197
01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:29.060
make sure that they actually act those elk?

2198
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:31.520
Same ideas like a deer guard but raised up,

2199
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:35.450
you know like the tea guards on the back of a semi,
I think.
Same idea,

2200
01:55:35.451 --> 01:55:38.960
but on the top of your thing,
they have deer guards.
They do a lot of deer guards.

2201
01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:41.630
A lot of people have duty Alaska.
Have you been there?
No.

2202
01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:45.540
That was a fascinating man.
It was just very fascinated comedy there.

2203
01:55:45.541 --> 01:55:47.040
Sometime I would love to,
but Doug,

2204
01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:50.160
Stan hope decided that the people are too stupid.
They're,
oh really?
Yeah.

2205
01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:54.660
That's all he needed to know.
If Doug,
Doug will do any goddamn crowd,
Doug,

2206
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:56.040
Doug will pull up into a bar.

2207
01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.070
There's not a s a chair to be found in a half a mile radius.

2208
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.970
Everyone's standing piss drunk and Doug,
Doug,
we'll be up there.
You know,

2209
01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:06.380
no one wants to fuck your kid on my space.

2210
01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:09.780
I literally going through his act and he's got no problem and he stopped going

2211
01:56:09.781 --> 01:56:12.120
to Alaska.
I don't know what the exact details were,

2212
01:56:12.121 --> 01:56:14.040
but I used to go there and party all the time.

2213
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.560
Enough per Luca Palanca and wheels Parisi.
We're doing that Gig.

2214
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.890
Oh my goodness.
This was probably six,
seven years ago,
but it was a great gig.

2215
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:25.320
Paid good.
And I'm sure there's a lot of cool people in Alaska.

2216
01:56:25.321 --> 01:56:27.940
Don't get me wrong.
I met cool people from Alaska.
Strange,

2217
01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:31.710
the number of knuckleheads.
It was strange.
It was a very strange place.

2218
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:33.290
It was cool.
Like a lot of cool stuff to do.

2219
01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:36.300
They're all like excited to tell you that they all know how to fly planes.

2220
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:39.150
They all,
you know,
they eat Moose Jerky,
they do all this crazy shit,

2221
01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:40.980
but then they do really crazy shit.

2222
01:56:40.981 --> 01:56:44.670
Like sniff oxycontin and look at you like you're the Weirdo when you don't,

2223
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:47.880
you know,
like that kind of shit.
Like a lot of pill heads up there.

2224
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:51.510
A lot of pill heads.
It's fair northern exposure.
It's not nothing to do there.

2225
01:56:51.670 --> 01:56:52.770
Hunt and fuck.

2226
01:56:52.771 --> 01:56:57.771
And it wasn't like the mother-in-law of Bristol Palin's baby daddy wasn't she

2227
01:56:59.461 --> 01:57:02.970
and busted for selling meth?
Probably.
Yeah,
pretty sure.

2228
01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:08.910
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure you know with Scilla Scilla that crazy bitch.

2229
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:12.900
She's with her husband.
Um,

2230
01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:16.800
Sarah Pailin husband who was friends with the guy who owned the radio station.

2231
01:57:16.801 --> 01:57:21.470
We did an anchorage t dob.
Bob was friends with him.
You played pool with him?

2232
01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.060
Played Pool with him,
but I didn't know it till years later.
This was six,

2233
01:57:24.061 --> 01:57:26.070
seven years ago.
Did he seem like he was gay?

2234
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:28.860
It didn't seem like anything cause he didn't matter to me.

2235
01:57:28.861 --> 01:57:33.060
He still had the same kind of like goatee and hair that looked very suspicious,

2236
01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:34.250
you know,
like the,

2237
01:57:34.251 --> 01:57:38.550
the look that he rocks think his look was like bison the way you say suspicious,

2238
01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:41.160
you mean like disingenuous?
He looks very mid nineties.

2239
01:57:41.161 --> 01:57:45.330
Very out of place for the year 2006 as it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
I was like,

2240
01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:48.930
either he's a time traveler out of style.
What do you,
when you do you,
are you,
uh,

2241
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:49.681
the type of guy that,

2242
01:57:49.681 --> 01:57:53.130
like when you see a powerful woman with some guy behind her who's not really

2243
01:57:53.131 --> 01:57:57.210
talking that much and he just automatically assume that he's a bitch?
Yeah,
yeah.

2244
01:57:57.211 --> 01:58:01.050
Right.
Yeah,
and not to be a pig or nothing,
but yeah,
I do.
Yeah,
I do.

2245
01:58:01.110 --> 01:58:04.890
When I see a really powerful woman,
I want to see what,
what's this guy like?

2246
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:09.150
Is he more powerful or is it less Steadman might be more powerful.

2247
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:14.160
What Oprah's man?
I think he's,
isn't he pretty rich?
Is he on his own?

2248
01:58:14.161 --> 01:58:17.320
Yeah,
he's pretty,
can be rich like over rich.
I don't think.
Nobody's Oprah.
Rich.

2249
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.790
We got to talk that over it.
Oh yeah,
we talked about kitty.

2250
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:24.810
Now we can talk about over it.
I just love it when Joe talks.
Oprah,

2251
01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.520
I watched the Oprah show sometimes describes it.
Oh,
do you like her?
No,
I,
yeah,

2252
01:58:29.521 --> 01:58:32.220
I think she's interesting.
I don't think she's a bad person.
She's a good person.

2253
01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:35.610
She's,
she's doing,
she's spreading positive energy and she's an easy target.

2254
01:58:35.611 --> 01:58:37.950
Would you blame your show Rogan or Ellen?

2255
01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:41.640
Her or Ellen who didn't Bang Bang Oprah.
I think

2256
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.610
<v 1>Oprah because she was really another pussy,
but she would probably like it.</v>

2257
01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:48.190
It's billion dollars,
Allen.
We'll try and be angry at me.

2258
01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:52.120
I mean that is assuming that Oprah is truly homosexual or heterosexual rather.

2259
01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:53.830
That'd be hot though.
I like it.
You know,
Alan's like,

2260
01:58:53.831 --> 01:58:56.800
I don't want this Dick and pick it up over here to take me.

2261
01:58:56.830 --> 01:59:01.060
You got a different thing that turns you on buddy.
And he checked it.
Well,

2262
01:59:01.061 --> 01:59:02.890
you know,
there's two types of lesbians.

2263
01:59:02.891 --> 01:59:07.150
There's lesbians by genetics or lesbians by circumstance and lesbians by life,

2264
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.570
you know,
lesbians by abusive men.
And those are the scary ones.

2265
01:59:10.571 --> 01:59:12.520
Not Scary but sad I should say.
Sad.

2266
01:59:12.690 --> 01:59:16.540
Well I've heard a lot of girls that they just met so many fucking asshole men

2267
01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:20.380
from their father all the way down to every fucking guy they've ever attracted

2268
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:23.130
and they're just like,
fuck man,
I need accompaniment,
I needed,

2269
01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:25.900
my girls always been there for me and you hug this girl and next thing you know

2270
01:59:25.901 --> 01:59:28.690
you're a lesbian.
Right?
Nothing wrong with that man.
Or you know,

2271
01:59:28.691 --> 01:59:31.570
I think women are much more open to the idea of experimenting and you know,

2272
01:59:31.571 --> 01:59:34.480
and then maybe they find that they like women better and it's something that

2273
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:38.050
most straight men would never do it.
I mean,
even if you're a girl,

2274
01:59:38.051 --> 01:59:42.760
you'd have to admit that,
you know,
plus a spectacular boobs.
Yeah.

2275
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:47.530
This rubber dicks.
I'm sure that they're happy with that.
Just dip it in water.

2276
01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:51.100
Hot Water.
Get warm.
Shove it in there.
I think it's real.
Dick.

2277
01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:55.300
Is it good to show it another guy?
How much sperm that they made today?
Yeah,

2278
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:58.060
like I picture don't show you the dude's your loads.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2279
01:59:58.061 --> 02:00:01.240
Unless they're in the business.
Click,
click.
All right.
Air quotes.

2280
02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.630
Do you send loads?
No,
I took a picture of today's one,
uh,

2281
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:08.460
because I didn't have sex yesterday and I just to show how much came out to do

2282
02:00:08.461 --> 02:00:10.000
you want to show one of your friends,
your loads?

2283
02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.800
I showed it to my girlfriend and she was like,
wow,
that's crazy.
And it is crazy.

2284
02:00:14.801 --> 02:00:17.200
And I just going to check a couple of times when,
when,
when you showed it to her,

2285
02:00:17.201 --> 02:00:18.820
cause he jerked off on your own.
Is that what it is?

2286
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:23.200
She was at work and I was like,
uh,
like hey fellows is going to show you,
but uh,

2287
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:26.560
it's gay.
Right?
That's gay.
That's worse than showing your poop.
Right.

2288
02:00:26.561 --> 02:00:29.080
You need to go to a doctor.
It's just like coming out of your body.

2289
02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:32.470
It's a gay cause it's called.
I've never show me pictures of your shit either,

2290
02:00:32.471 --> 02:00:36.550
unless they're spectacularly huge.
I had a wraparound porch amount of calm.

2291
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:40.960
It's surprising.
Okay.
Egg whites or something.
I don't know.

2292
02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:45.730
Eating healthy,
I don't know.
Taking zinc now.
Any supplements?
Sushi.
Sushi.

2293
02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:48.340
The social dude.
There's a lot of zinc out of heavy metals as well.

2294
02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:52.510
It'd be careful.
I believe they drove Jeremy Pivot and crazy,
right?
He didn't.

2295
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:55.590
He had to get out of some sort of a show because of that.
What's that?
Mercury.

2296
02:00:55.730 --> 02:00:57.970
Mercury overdose.
It's fucking real shit,
man.
I used to,

2297
02:00:57.971 --> 02:01:01.330
I used to eat anchovies every week,
ac five,
six cans,
anchovies,

2298
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:04.150
and then I got my blood work done and the doctor said there was arsenic in my

2299
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:07.030
blood.
Not much,
but a little bit.
And I go,
what the fuck?

2300
02:01:07.031 --> 02:01:09.700
Someone trying to poison me.
No.
He's like,
no,
it's a heavy metal.

2301
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:13.270
Have you'd be needing a lot of seafood?
And I said,
yeah,
I eat a lot of sardines.

2302
02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:16.690
It's like,
don't eat the sardines for awhile.
I'll do another test on the clean.

2303
02:01:17.050 --> 02:01:19.840
It's arsenic arsenic from some like that too,
right?

2304
02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:25.270
Oceans are so God damn polluted.
Yeah.
There's that gigantic patch of,

2305
02:01:25.271 --> 02:01:28.310
of garbage that's floating somewhere in the middle of the Pacific.

2306
02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:31.920
It's not just one.
There's a bunch of them and it's underwater.

2307
02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:35.060
It's not just on the surface.
There's like a fuck load of it under one end.

2308
02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.410
There are enormous,
now they're almost the exact size of the United States.

2309
02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.830
It's habit.
That's crazy.
Used to be the size of Texas and the latest one.

2310
02:01:42.831 --> 02:01:45.440
Would they say that it was almost the size of the United States?

2311
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:49.190
That's ridiculous.
Insane.
It's the scariest thing ever and in,
you know what?

2312
02:01:49.191 --> 02:01:52.250
All this shit that came from fucking Tokyo was all added to that too,
by the way.

2313
02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.070
Are from Japan rather.
Yeah.
All that shit that got washed away in the earth,

2314
02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:57.800
in the,
in the earthquake,
the tsunami.
That stuff's out at sea.

2315
02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.600
I mean there's all a lot of fucking debris out at sea.
They're finding houses,

2316
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.110
actual full houses floating in the ocean.
Oh,
I'm sure.

2317
02:02:06.111 --> 02:02:09.530
And way out there and they've had what,
three seven pluses.

2318
02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:14.330
And it's so crazy that someone decided to put a goddamn series of nuclear

2319
02:02:14.331 --> 02:02:17.930
reactors on fault lines.
Like it's almost like fault lines on an island.

2320
02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:21.680
People were so silly.
It's like daily w the earth could move,

2321
02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.900
but then again it might not.
It's man's,
you know,

2322
02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:26.600
it's when people start to say this God stuff and they said to be like,
look,

2323
02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:28.970
look at the,
and you know,
it's like,
no,
there isn't a god.

2324
02:02:28.971 --> 02:02:31.670
It's just mother nature of being itself.
And we went and did something stupid,

2325
02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:34.190
you know?
Well that is mother nature though.

2326
02:02:34.191 --> 02:02:39.191
We are insanely curious and we have this weird desire to test the boundaries and

2327
02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.120
to try limitations.
Yeah.

2328
02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:45.230
We to tame Mother Nature and also to tool off the next new thing to be able to

2329
02:02:45.231 --> 02:02:48.680
get power out of this gigantic building that fills up the entire city.

2330
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:50.540
It's just some new me.
Literally,

2331
02:02:50.541 --> 02:02:53.750
they're harnessing the power of the fucking sun inside this,

2332
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:58.220
this facility and containing it somehow or another.
The real problem is,

2333
02:02:58.221 --> 02:02:59.960
I mean they've,
they've made some,
you know,

2334
02:02:59.961 --> 02:03:02.180
some safe guards and shit and make things,
you know,

2335
02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:04.940
a little bit they can contain situation's a little bit better,

2336
02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.240
but clearly they didn't think of every possible scenario.

2337
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:11.240
They didn't think of a nine.
Right.
They didn't know.

2338
02:03:11.241 --> 02:03:15.260
They didn't think of a nine that rattled for five minutes.

2339
02:03:15.261 --> 02:03:16.940
Because when you think of that and you think of a nine,

2340
02:03:16.941 --> 02:03:19.160
you have to consider if you're putting out a budget for something,

2341
02:03:19.161 --> 02:03:22.910
how often does a nine happened so often that we can't,
we can't appeal.

2342
02:03:22.911 --> 02:03:25.070
We can't pay for the worst possible scenario.

2343
02:03:25.071 --> 02:03:27.980
We have to pay for a pretty bad one.
But what a colossal fuck up.

2344
02:03:28.150 --> 02:03:31.190
It's another reason to get the fuck out of California because there's all sorts

2345
02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:35.330
of fault and there's all sorts of fucking reactors.
There's one in Orange County.

2346
02:03:35.331 --> 02:03:40.070
Anything over an eight we've got a big problem.
Yeah.
If it's scary shit man.

2347
02:03:40.071 --> 02:03:40.491
But you know what?

2348
02:03:40.491 --> 02:03:43.510
That's the cost of living somewhere where it's 75 degrees every day.
Yeah.

2349
02:03:43.511 --> 02:03:45.680
But it's not 75 degrees every day in Japan.

2350
02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.680
And I don't know what the deal is over there.
You know what,

2351
02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:50.960
I'm not and that's why I don't think the coolest shit.
That's why they do this.

2352
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.450
Yeah.

2353
02:03:51.450 --> 02:03:54.200
This is another subject that we talked about yesterday on the Corolla show that

2354
02:03:54.201 --> 02:03:58.160
this is the exact perfect place geographically as far as like climate,

2355
02:03:58.190 --> 02:04:00.800
you can't get any better.
But as far as like the,

2356
02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:04.540
the worth of human beings because there's so many of us,
you know the you,

2357
02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.270
it becomes people becomes less valuable and they become more aggressive toward

2358
02:04:08.271 --> 02:04:11.260
each other and more shitty to each other is way more cool people because there's

2359
02:04:11.261 --> 02:04:14.990
so many of us because it just sheer numbers.
I mean this podcast is,

2360
02:04:14.991 --> 02:04:16.250
is absolute proof of that.

2361
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.380
One of the coolest things about this podcast to me is like it reunites mean and,

2362
02:04:21.381 --> 02:04:21.571
and,

2363
02:04:21.571 --> 02:04:25.040
and like makes me realize how many interesting fucking people I know how many

2364
02:04:25.041 --> 02:04:28.340
cool friends I have that can come over and we have these cool conversations and

2365
02:04:28.341 --> 02:04:30.860
then this goes out into the Internet and the whole world gets it.

2366
02:04:30.861 --> 02:04:33.650
It's like there's not that many people that have,
you know,

2367
02:04:33.651 --> 02:04:37.100
Freddy Loc Arts and Sam Tripoli's and all these different characters and Duncan

2368
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:39.270
trussell's and you know,
and,
and Kevin Pereira,

2369
02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:42.840
there's all these different cool people and Joey and Ari in their life.
I mean,

2370
02:04:42.841 --> 02:04:44.390
there's so many of them,
you know?

2371
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.090
And part of that is because we're living in this giant population center and

2372
02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:51.780
it's very show big centric.
So you know,
everyone's attracted to this spot.

2373
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:54.690
It's one of the few things that keeps me here.
Really.
I like it.
I mean,

2374
02:04:54.691 --> 02:04:57.240
it becomes like a way of life after a while and you really can't leave it

2375
02:04:57.241 --> 02:04:58.950
because when I'm outside of Weirdo Ville,

2376
02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:02.170
I find that normal people would be extremely weird.
You know what I mean?

2377
02:05:02.171 --> 02:05:05.130
Is I find that once and desires of my friends,
when I go back,

2378
02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:07.620
when I go back to Arizona and I hang out with some of my friends,

2379
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:10.620
some of them are still have their youth and they still have kids and they have

2380
02:05:10.621 --> 02:05:11.970
family,
but they maintain their youth.

2381
02:05:12.150 --> 02:05:14.020
The most of them just turned into their parents.
Right.

2382
02:05:14.190 --> 02:05:16.790
And it's a really weird thing to me that like they say,

2383
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.100
the pressing the apex of their life is over and now it's just kind of like going

2384
02:05:20.101 --> 02:05:23.250
through the motions where I still like to think the best is yet to talk with
you.

2385
02:05:23.251 --> 02:05:26.220
You have a different career than that.
I haven't much regular career.

2386
02:05:26.221 --> 02:05:29.640
You're a guy who sells Buicks,
whatever the fuck you are.

2387
02:05:30.150 --> 02:05:31.620
But when people add you on Facebook,

2388
02:05:31.621 --> 02:05:34.870
how crazy different do they look like then you us,
you know like,
like,

2389
02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.860
like people adding,
adding need a Facebook from high school and stuff.
I'm like,

2390
02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:40.510
Holy Shit.
That I'm older dads friends now.
Yeah.

2391
02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:42.300
Well Pork Fox have to work for living.

2392
02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:45.390
Those poor folks are out there grinding visually.
Visually.

2393
02:05:45.391 --> 02:05:48.750
They just look like stress 20 or 30 years older.
Look at Obama,

2394
02:05:48.751 --> 02:05:51.730
look at what he looks like now as opposed to what you do.

2395
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:54.780
Look at Bush when Bush got into office and then towards the end,

2396
02:05:54.781 --> 02:05:56.950
look at Clinton Clinton's whole hair.
Whole head.

2397
02:05:56.951 --> 02:05:58.830
Her hair went gray by the time he was out.

2398
02:05:59.010 --> 02:06:03.060
I mean that Shit ages you any like extreme stress ages.
Yeah.
Victim,

2399
02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:06.540
your stress level compared to a guy with a real job?
It's ridiculously low.
Yeah.

2400
02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.220
Mine is ridiculously low.

2401
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.450
I don't stress about a whole lot to the point where I've gotten,
you know,

2402
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:15.980
I have time to stress all the time now even if it's not important.

2403
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:19.590
I need to stop doing that because your life is easy as fuck.

2404
02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:21.930
It's even when my life is hard,

2405
02:06:21.931 --> 02:06:24.240
like the difficult shit about my life is all just,

2406
02:06:24.241 --> 02:06:28.620
just requires preparation and there's no stress because I actually enjoy doing

2407
02:06:28.621 --> 02:06:31.740
it.
Sure.
The real stress comes from something that you don't enjoy doing it,

2408
02:06:31.741 --> 02:06:35.400
but it requires an extreme amount of preparation and extreme amount of time and

2409
02:06:35.401 --> 02:06:38.130
you put all this effort into something you don't even like and you're just doing

2410
02:06:38.131 --> 02:06:39.470
it just for money.
Yeah.

2411
02:06:39.610 --> 02:06:41.820
You know like if you're a lawyer and you don't like being a lawyer,

2412
02:06:41.821 --> 02:06:45.140
you're just doing it cause there's a lot of money in it will fucking break you.

2413
02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:46.530
And I think that's the,
at the end of the day,

2414
02:06:46.531 --> 02:06:49.260
that's what brought us all here is we have that child like thing in us that says

2415
02:06:49.261 --> 02:06:51.960
I want to do this thing.
I always wanted to do it and then see it through.
Yeah,

2416
02:06:52.090 --> 02:06:54.840
you have to be completely child like to believe you could actually pull it off.

2417
02:06:55.050 --> 02:06:57.250
I remember when I was a kid,
I was dating this girl,

2418
02:06:57.251 --> 02:07:00.150
I was 21 she was a really nice girl and there was Jennifer and she was a

2419
02:07:00.151 --> 02:07:03.780
sweetheart and we were both really young and really stupid and you know,

2420
02:07:03.781 --> 02:07:07.320
she was just getting out of college and I was a psychopath and her father did

2421
02:07:07.321 --> 02:07:09.090
not want her hanging around with maybe she was like,

2422
02:07:09.091 --> 02:07:10.980
he's trying to be a comedian.
Oh yeah.

2423
02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.950
What are the odds that he's going to make it?
Like this kid is not going to,

2424
02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.380
he's going to be a loser.
And I remember sitting and thinking about going,
wow,

2425
02:07:16.381 --> 02:07:20.640
I never even considered that.
Right.
I'm just going to do this,
man.

2426
02:07:20.641 --> 02:07:24.210
I'm just going to do this.
Like I'm,
I'm going to do it.
You know what,
if you fail,

2427
02:07:24.211 --> 02:07:27.630
what have you do?
One of you felt maybe,
I don't know right now,

2428
02:07:27.631 --> 02:07:30.060
I've got to just do this.
I gotta go.
I gotta show and Peabody,

2429
02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:34.740
I gotta fucking get,
get some gas in my tank.
I'm not thinking about not doing it,

2430
02:07:34.741 --> 02:07:36.040
man.
I might fuck up on my fail.

2431
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.200
<v 3>Yeah,
I'm terrified of being a loser.
Absolutely.</v>

2432
02:07:38.201 --> 02:07:40.870
But I'm not going to just sit here and dwell on it.
I'm just,

2433
02:07:40.871 --> 02:07:44.050
I'm going to go for it.
Most people would not be a comedian.

2434
02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.780
They want predictability in their lives and they want their lives to be mapped

2435
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:50.290
out for them.
And it's like I live day to day.
I literally live day to day.

2436
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.990
I literally get up and say,
what is today offer?
This is going to be great.

2437
02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:55.840
You know,
my girlfriend,
she's a sweetheart,
but she's stressed this all the time.

2438
02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:58.600
Always share.
The Sky is falling and all that and I have to tell her pocket,

2439
02:07:58.690 --> 02:08:01.030
let it go.
We're all built,
designed,

2440
02:08:01.031 --> 02:08:04.690
engineered by the universe and nature and our own personal experiences.

2441
02:08:04.691 --> 02:08:06.610
We're all different and we're just fucking different.

2442
02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:08.770
And you're not supposed to be a physicist.

2443
02:08:08.771 --> 02:08:10.660
You're not supposed to be teaching at Harvard.
You know,

2444
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:12.850
you're not supposed to be working on,
you know,

2445
02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:17.110
molecular science and breaking down the university or not.

2446
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.870
I'm not supposed to be doing it either.
I'm supposed to be a comedian.
I mean,

2447
02:08:19.871 --> 02:08:23.890
it's really simple.
I mean,
this is what my personality is,
gels the best with.

2448
02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:27.430
And you know,
some people's,
it's the most terrifying thing in the world to go on.

2449
02:08:27.431 --> 02:08:30.220
I mean,
you know,
we've got shows this weekend,
all in Philadelphia,

2450
02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:33.310
one of the wildest fucking towns,
everything's sold out in advance.

2451
02:08:33.311 --> 02:08:35.740
We're going to go there as they're going to be fucking crazy.
It's me,

2452
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:38.070
Joey Diaz and Ari were going to be an in that,

2453
02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:41.740
that helium in Philly for some people that would be unbelievably terrifying.

2454
02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.110
The idea that you're going to go there,

2455
02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:47.800
there's going to be this packed show of people will anticipating your material,

2456
02:08:47.801 --> 02:08:49.150
wanting you to make them a laugh,

2457
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:52.870
paying to see you talk and they're going to be drinking.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2458
02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:55.930
But to a lot of people that,
that idea is horrified.

2459
02:08:56.050 --> 02:09:00.130
If you went to any town hall or in the town hall,
when the fuck,

2460
02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.210
what am I even talking about?

2461
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:04.930
Kinda getting any store and take some guy who was a working behind the counter,

2462
02:09:04.931 --> 02:09:08.700
you know,
it was a a cashier and say,
okay,
we're going to uni.

2463
02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:11.740
You've got one day to come up with a bunch of shit to say and then you're going

2464
02:09:11.741 --> 02:09:14.540
to go on stage in front of these rabid animals and,
and you know,
and,

2465
02:09:14.541 --> 02:09:16.240
and some comedy club in Philadelphia.
Right.

2466
02:09:16.241 --> 02:09:19.120
That'd be the most terrifying thing in the world.
But for you,
I'm telling you,

2467
02:09:19.210 --> 02:09:23.260
as I'm telling you,
you're getting this big smile on the face.
Oh man,

2468
02:09:23.261 --> 02:09:26.050
that sounds like fun.
Yeah,
look at you.
You're thinking about it.
That's the thing.

2469
02:09:26.051 --> 02:09:26.950
It's like,
yeah,
we were,

2470
02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:29.440
you're supposed to be doing this for so long that it's like,

2471
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:33.190
that's super exciting to me.
And it's like,
you know,
I'll meet people,
like,

2472
02:09:33.230 --> 02:09:36.070
they'll hang out with you before your show or something.
Be like nervous.

2473
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:37.500
I'm like,
what?
What about,

2474
02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:39.430
what about your show tonight and you're not even thinking it.

2475
02:09:39.431 --> 02:09:42.460
I wouldn't think about my show until it's time to go to the show.
You know,

2476
02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:45.310
people do.
They don't realize that you would get nervous.

2477
02:09:45.311 --> 02:09:48.310
It was your first time ever on stage and you'd never done it before.

2478
02:09:48.370 --> 02:09:51.940
But once you do it a bunch of times,
it becomes a thing you do.
You get excited,

2479
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:52.960
you mean,
but you know,

2480
02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.910
you make sure you do your preparation and then you don't get nervous.
Yeah.

2481
02:09:55.911 --> 02:09:58.990
Granted there's that fight or flight feeling right before I go to butterflies to

2482
02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.370
let me know I'm a human and I'm alive.

2483
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:04.000
I've harnessed it and I take that adrenaline and make it happy time instead of,

2484
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:06.100
you know,
and that's like,
I think we talked about last time,

2485
02:10:06.101 --> 02:10:08.620
that adrenaline is what prevents you from farting,
sneezing,

2486
02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.460
having to puke on stage,
shutdown peeing.

2487
02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:15.460
And you just go right into fight or flight where you have to be focused,
focused,

2488
02:10:15.461 --> 02:10:18.600
focused,
focused.
I've never had a stop a show cause I had to pay,
never happy,

2489
02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:20.920
never had a poop.
Never had to know.
I'm lactose intolerant,

2490
02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:22.620
I can be up there drinking milk and I want to have to stop.

2491
02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.410
Everything shuts down everything in a strange way to make live in,
isn't it?

2492
02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:27.311
It is,

2493
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:30.970
but it's the only way I know in my entire adult life and we're all here on this

2494
02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:34.580
west coast hanging on,
trying to make it happen.

2495
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:38.930
Trying to put that fucking entertainment thing together in the perfect way and

2496
02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:44.060
they call those fucking pieces fall into place and boom.
Done.
Leave your mark.

2497
