00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.051
<v Speaker 1>Drive my day.</v>

2
00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>The early morning thing I guess has been successful.</v>

4
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:06.481
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>The day of the,</v>

6
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>it's unsuccessful.</v>

8
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Radically unsuccessful.</v>

9
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>There's been 17 different people missing weight since you,</v>

10
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.153
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

11
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Like one or two in the same time.</v>

12
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>So we'll then what's this?</v>

13
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Why is that then just because they want to get the edge,</v>

14
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:22.891
<v Speaker 1>the safety,</v>

15
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:23.461
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>

16
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It gives people more time to rehydrate themselves.</v>

17
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is it gives them less time to lose the weight.</v>

18
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

19
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>So if you're starting off early in the morning,</v>

20
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:30.721
<v Speaker 1>like if your,</v>

21
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>if your weigh ins or at four o'clock and you know you're not going to eat all</v>

22
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:33.451
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

23
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose weight all throughout the day.</v>

24
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>But if your way ins right at eight o'clock in the morning,</v>

25
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>when are you getting up?</v>

26
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>You're going to lose all that weight.</v>

27
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you might not,</v>

29
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>you might not lose enough weight.</v>

30
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>So people are miscalculating.</v>

31
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a lot and there's definitely an issue with people cutting too</v>

32
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:48.631
<v Speaker 1>much weight.</v>

33
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely an issue with people doing it.</v>

34
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Unhealthy Sunday be punished or penalized even more though,</v>

35
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>like I just recently heard Ray Gosling,</v>

36
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>30% of his wealth and that's what,</v>

37
00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

38
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.491
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

39
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Beedamon Calvin Gospel when they admit,</v>

40
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.441
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

41
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really been looking after my died.</v>

42
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>What you're a professional athletes signed to the,</v>

43
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>the biggest organization in the world.</v>

44
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't have be part of the contract that if you're fighting for us that</v>

45
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to maintain.</v>

46
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>You almost have those I instead of even a random drug tests,</v>

47
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>random one random way,</v>

48
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>obviously they made Calvin go up to one 85.</v>

49
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

50
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.771
<v Speaker 1>next fight.</v>

51
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And what's crazy is you looked fucking</v>

52
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.003
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

53
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And Tim Kennedy blew his entire Wad trying to take him down and beat him up.</v>

54
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And they earlier the first round,</v>

55
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:31.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

56
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

57
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

58
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>he showed his size advantage,</v>

59
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>his strength advantage.</v>

60
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>He's a massive,</v>

61
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>like he's a massive powerhouse when it comes to his ground and pound his</v>

63
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.793
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

64
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>But Calvin just stayed the course.</v>

65
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>So good defense.</v>

66
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually when he got on his feet,</v>

67
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>man way to swift and it's how many times does he wish now three just missed a</v>

68
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.304
<v Speaker 1>bunch of,</v>

69
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>he missed against Tyron Woodley and,</v>

70
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.891
<v Speaker 1>and beat him.</v>

71
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And Tyron has a gentleman decided to pass even take his money.</v>

72
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Remember the,</v>

73
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>which is a very fucking,</v>

74
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

75
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>ethical and moral move by the champ now the current champ.</v>

76
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>So he lost that and I mean there was more than one fight in the past before</v>

77
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.503
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

78
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>When do you say,</v>

79
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

80
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

81
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I show good career because he's a great fighter.</v>

82
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you say very good.</v>

83
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>One 85 so let's hope okay stays.</v>

84
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>But if what he misses way to one 85 then you should take a year.</v>

85
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.713
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

86
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>put the fear in them and then they,</v>

88
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>they really going to do,</v>

89
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I think Calvin should fight at 85 I mean I think he could,</v>

90
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>when he could win it 70 I think he can make 70 but he doesn't always make sense.</v>

91
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.541
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>

92
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>One I think.</v>

93
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

94
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean unless he wants to lose a ton of body fat and then try fighting in one 70</v>

95
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>really clean his diet up.</v>

97
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Really going hard on the Giardia.</v>

98
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Donnie hinders does not seem like the same person.</v>

99
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

100
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.391
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

101
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Because of Thomson wrecking them the way a lot of work.</v>

102
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause I heard you say as well,</v>

103
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>even the Brighton like physically just not look physically the no,</v>

104
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't look like he works as hard.</v>

105
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like he is as motivated.</v>

106
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look as hungry.</v>

107
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>His vaunted knock out.</v>

108
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Power is gone.</v>

109
00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Gone,</v>

110
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>gone weird.</v>

111
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

112
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it to him and I should a long time ago,</v>

114
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>if I was just coaching with his tie,</v>

115
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>his left hand to his body and it put him after every workout,</v>

116
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>you go three or four rounds on the back,</v>

117
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>just using your right hand.</v>

119
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if he developed a right hand on top of that?</v>

120
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean because it was 90% was left,</v>

122
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you know you would that,</v>

123
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>now you open a whole new door,</v>

125
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you know and it's an unfair to question someone whether or not they tested</v>

127
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>positive for anything.</v>

128
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:26.891
<v Speaker 1>If they are,</v>

129
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>whenever I took anything.</v>

130
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't tested positive.</v>

131
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So he never tested positive for anything.</v>

132
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So you can't look at it to I don't think he did.</v>

133
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Did he know maybe a diuretic or something?</v>

134
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.711
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

135
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

136
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I have no find out of Johnny Hendricks ever tested positive for something.</v>

137
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.934
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did.</v>

138
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.631
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

139
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people throwing accusations about him and George St Pierre was</v>

140
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.430
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>

141
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it costs will be like one of the things he said about his last</v>

142
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:47.471
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

143
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>he said he'd worked out for four times a week,</v>

144
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.360
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

145
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>a one time,</v>

146
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:52.391
<v Speaker 1>four times a week.</v>

147
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:52.631
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

148
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>he just was not focused on that fight.</v>

149
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

150
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get out.</v>

151
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>That's why he looks like that.</v>

152
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with you saw it or anything else.</v>

153
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't have the hunger anymore.</v>

154
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 1>That's where you,</v>

155
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself at great risk,</v>

156
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>but also mentally going into the fight.</v>

157
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>If you know that is not a guy trained 10 times a week and you've trained for,</v>

158
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with four?</v>

159
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird that his power went away.</v>

160
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

161
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean he used to make ice crumble.</v>

162
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.953
<v Speaker 1>He's to let me,</v>

163
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>when you hit John Fitch and went flying,</v>

164
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Martin Kampmann flying,</v>

165
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.123
<v Speaker 1>went flying.</v>

166
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It was like he had magic in his hands and then all of a sudden it stopped.</v>

167
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.013
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

168
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.920
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck don't have to be a monkey thing.</v>

169
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And really just ruined him.</v>

170
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>He fucked them up.</v>

172
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>And you fucked him up and he fucked him up with like using that front leg side</v>

174
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>kick and then the front leg round kiss.</v>

175
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.881
<v Speaker 1>What'd he hit?</v>

176
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>A Bat?</v>

177
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.051
<v Speaker 1>One to the body.</v>

178
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And then Johnny like black nods his head like you got me and then slap the same</v>

179
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>one right up to the face.</v>

180
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

181
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing we would want.</v>

182
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.101
<v Speaker 1>We want to buy.</v>

183
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:48.934
<v Speaker 1>He makes it,</v>

184
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

185
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.991
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly.</v>

186
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And then it suddenly your hook kick and a question mark again.</v>

187
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>It's every time it's a different cake.</v>

188
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.981

190
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.761
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's going to come.</v>

191
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.840

<v Speaker 1>All the spinning kicks.</v>

193
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:59.100
