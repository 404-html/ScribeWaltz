00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Hello Carl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you again buddy.</v>

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is like Deja Vu.</v>

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was eight months ago or so.</v>

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Then I was on the podcast wasn't and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>flew like that.</v>

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does fly like that.</v>

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of scary.</v>

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>A little too quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I just turned 30 and 40 before you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

11
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say 30 was the first one </v>

12
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>where I ever really stopped like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes before I turned 30.</v>

13
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I actually took a moment and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.253
<v Speaker 1>you're 29.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy your last 30 minutes of being 29 </v>

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and when I hit 30 it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>little inkling of.</v>

16
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is kind of what a midlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis feels like because I have a three</v>

17
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:45.984
<v Speaker 1>in front now and I'm not really not </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with that because I feel </v>

18
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>like I'm still a fucking 19 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

19
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a weird thing to be obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your,</v>

20
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an inevitable progression.</v>

21
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Like to be obsessed with youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I love being in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>why would you love something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go away real quick?</v>

24
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get old.</v>

25
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stay healthy.</v>

26
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people who fight it,</v>

27
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>it's always easy to tell that when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go get plastic surgery and stuff.</v>

28
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do like one plastic surgery,</v>

29
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>sometimes somebody could get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

30
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but if you do multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all everybody knows almost immediately.</v>

31
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You ever watched that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Botched.</v>

32
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started getting into it.</v>

33
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:30.624
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned the TV on and it was just on </v>

34
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>like when I turned the TV on and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

35
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.534
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this lady was getting her nose </v>

36
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.934
<v Speaker 1>repaired because it had collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she had gotten so many plastic </v>

37
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:42.714
<v Speaker 1>surgeries on her nose that are sinus had</v>
<v Speaker 1>caved in so they had to take a chunk of </v>

38
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>her rib proper knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then then the,</v>

39
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the tissue inside was dying.</v>

40
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>One of those guys wants to come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found out we were talking about it.</v>

41
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So he wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many times can you talk</v>

42
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>about plastic surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

43
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Patient fucked up,</v>

44
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.253
<v Speaker 1>but what's the doctor going to try to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch your audience on getting to know </v>

45
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>the opposite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably against the repair</v>

46
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

47
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>so what shows about repairing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucked up and you know,</v>

48
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>it looks so primitive to when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they do it,</v>

49
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>like the way that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed this about wisdom teeth when I</v>

50
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>got my wisdom teeth pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally just go in there like you</v>

51
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>would expect for like a car repair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>

52
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to rip it out.</v>

53
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And you see them like leaning on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling it and you're like,</v>

54
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>oh I thought this was more advanced than</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

55
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:34.494
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not step on your cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually went under for my wisdom </v>

56
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>teeth because I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm such a bitch,</v>

57
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought so.</v>

58
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess I got the Michael Jackson stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the propofol.</v>

59
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

60
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because you just,</v>

61
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>they tell you to like count back down </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 100 and 199 and I remember stop.</v>

62
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so terrible.</v>

63
00:03:03.421 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That's knee surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on here?</v>

64
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.173
<v Speaker 2>What stock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck they put in as Neiman </v>

65
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.990
<v Speaker 2>and he's trying to get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my Jesus.</v>

66
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.033
<v Speaker 2>Oh cool.</v>

67
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.443
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moral of the story is we actually </v>

68
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:20.514
<v Speaker 1>don't know what we're doing as human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and we're still obviously very </v>

69
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:23.484
<v Speaker 1>primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the advanced stuff is super </v>

70
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.000
<v Speaker 1>primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that shows.</v>

71
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

72
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe that guy just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

73
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever seen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

74
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it for everything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even with those jobs,</v>

75
00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>don't they do the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Oh,</v>

76
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>we're going to chisel down the nose so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to take like a fricking sander</v>

77
00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:42.200
<v Speaker 1>or something and just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I had my deviated septum fixed and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to pack it.</v>

79
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.033
<v Speaker 1>They pack it full of stuff and so you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all clogged up and they took big chunks </v>

80
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>of the bone out of the inside because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call it?</v>

81
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.763
<v Speaker 1>Turbinates or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bunch of scar tissue </v>

82
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>calcification here.</v>

83
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Sees when someone has cauliflower ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

84
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighters.</v>

85
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:03.984
<v Speaker 1>Usually you get that in your nose too if</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nose has been broken a bunch of </v>

86
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:07.280
<v Speaker 1>times because what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

87
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>That cauliflower ear is his blood under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface of the skin calcifies and it</v>

88
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:13.524
<v Speaker 1>becomes essentially a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you touched someone's California </v>

89
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.493
<v Speaker 1>in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's literally like there's a rock in </v>

90
00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of crazy.</v>

91
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.883
<v Speaker 1>Will you get that inside your nose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>when your nose had been broken a bunch </v>

92
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.334
<v Speaker 1>of times and it bleeds in the inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue and then it turns into this </v>

93
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.180
<v Speaker 1>really hard thing that blocks all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinuses,</v>

94
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>so if you put a hole in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

95
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rock.</v>

96
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's calcium rock.</v>

97
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen those videos of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cysts when they drain the cysts?</v>

98
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that lady's a instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>page Dr?</v>

99
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.291

100

<v Speaker 1>You need to go to Dr Pepper.</v>

101
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he doing it?</v>

111
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some pretty decent acne when I was</v>

112
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:13.530
<v Speaker 1>in high school or get a good one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't nothing.</v>

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>

118
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Still going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ain't shit.</v>

119
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I will say that it's a nightmare once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find some other ones.</v>

121
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Look of that is disgusting,</v>

122
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:34.524
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's universally agreed upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the feel of getting a big pimple </v>

123
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.660
<v Speaker 1>and popping it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels amazing.</v>

124
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a cyst.</v>

125
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Someone's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

126
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 1>can you stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:49.130
<v Speaker 1>He's got a bulging system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a fucking eyeball dude.</v>

128
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a marble.</v>

129
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never good again.</v>

130
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Elite again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll fine.</v>

131
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to eat any cysts.</v>

132
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the side of someone's head </v>

133
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>weight and it didn't even actually like </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally pop out either.</v>

134
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.563
<v Speaker 1>While those things are stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of your skin's </v>

135
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.663
<v Speaker 1>protein tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have pretty bad acne when I </v>

136
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.054
<v Speaker 1>was younger and I had accutane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave me accutane and that stuff </v>

137
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:15.254
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they say that there's a small </v>

138
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>chance that like I guess in maybe one </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent or point,</v>

139
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of cases.</v>

140
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.183
<v Speaker 1>Some people got depression and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said there's a risk of suicide with </v>

141
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never.</v>

142
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:30.941
<v Speaker 1>It never affected me in that way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really just zonked your sebaceous</v>

143
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 1>glands and your just good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>

144
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>My friend Andrew Santina had it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same reason,</v>

146
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:40.050
<v Speaker 1>but he said he got the side effect is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

147
00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:40.671
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

148
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.504
<v Speaker 1>On one hand it was amazing because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin cleared up and the other hand he's </v>

149
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 1>never felt so bad and it's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

150
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know what to do because </v>

151
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you feel bad if you have acne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel bad if you take the medication,</v>

152
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>but the medication will knock out all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the acne.</v>

153
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also take,</v>

154
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't take accutane anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually take finasteride for hair</v>

155
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>and they say trump takes that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there were some doctors,</v>

156
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.134
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how credible this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there were some doctors who were </v>

157
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff is not that great in terms of</v>

158
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.293
<v Speaker 1>mental health.</v>

159
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Propecia,</v>

160
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:10.784
<v Speaker 1>propecia and the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing in inhibits </v>

161
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.664
<v Speaker 1>dihydrotestosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does cause depression and some </v>

162
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:17.084
<v Speaker 1>people I think are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are he said that his depression was </v>

163
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>linked to when he started taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>propecia.</v>

164
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

165
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never affected me that way.</v>

166
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 1>It decreases your testosterone though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kills Your boners.</v>

167
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine are all right there.</v>

168
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would they be if you didn't take it?</v>

169
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess double or triple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

170
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is I wouldn't look good.</v>

171
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you really pull off a bald </v>
<v Speaker 1>head very nicely.</v>

172
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I'd look like a leukemia </v>
<v Speaker 1>patient.</v>

173
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do get a decent sized head dude.</v>

174
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

175
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't look good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at me.</v>

176
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.983
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to go to the gym way more </v>

177
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>than I do now and I'd have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tattoos everywhere to look.</v>

178
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to look like a bad ass with </v>

179
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>a bald head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you do.</v>

180
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>There's this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this wrestler for Wwe,</v>

181
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had really long greasy hair,</v>

182
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:06.344
<v Speaker 1>like the typical wrestler hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he recently decided to shave </v>

183
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>his head and he pulled it off nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks way better with a bald head.</v>

184
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

185
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.563
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just one of those guys where you </v>

186
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>looked gross with the really long hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was greasy.</v>

187
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>But when you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you went bald,</v>

188
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you look normal.</v>

189
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.523
<v Speaker 1>That Greasy Harrison new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the John Wick hair greasiness </v>

190
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:25.221
<v Speaker 1>in the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

191
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>When remember when Keanu reeves was John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wick,</v>

192
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>it was always greasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

193
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:29.954
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good movie to listen to or watch </v>

194
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.840
<v Speaker 1>rather when you're on the treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is doing a cardio challenge,</v>

195
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>a good one tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greasy.</v>

196
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like Gel people make fun of</v>
<v Speaker 1>me because Gel they say uh,</v>

197
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>so like 19 nineties and I'm still </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing it.</v>

198
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Creature of habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just chill.</v>

199
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.383
<v Speaker 1>It's available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will make fun of you for </v>

200
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

201
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them a chance,</v>

202
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.373
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a powder on my face the other day </v>

203
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>because I was under these lights and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did feel silly as I put it on.</v>

204
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

205
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:58.660
<v Speaker 3>why can't I just be shining?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

206
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People terrified of sweat.</v>

207
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem to me was pasty and shiny,</v>

208
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 3>so super white and shiny and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked gross.</v>

209
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 3>It looks like I'm unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of you were like a bronze bronze.</v>

210
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 3>That's slightly better but still kinda </v>
<v Speaker 3>gross.</v>

211
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 3>So you were saying that you got into it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you asked Chris Christie something.</v>

212
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Political,</v>

213
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 3>political or what is political as Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 3>was saying,</v>

214
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like comicon for political dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

215
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

216
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 3>and it's weird because what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

217
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 3>is they invite like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

218
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 3>like establishment media figures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some politicians,</v>

219
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.673
<v Speaker 3>but then they also invite new media </v>
<v Speaker 3>figures like me and our worlds do not </v>

220
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 3>mix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

221
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

222
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 3>many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think many of them knew who</v>

223
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

224
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 3>when you actually go to the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>were there,</v>

225
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.623
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all the new media people who are </v>

226
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:52.780
<v Speaker 3>getting the most attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

227
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.833
<v Speaker 3>Where you have guys like Bill Kristol </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around who was in the Bush </v>

228
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 3>administration and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who?</v>

229
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.403
<v Speaker 3>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a very weird thing going on </v>

230
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:03.024
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

231
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.073
<v Speaker 3>Kudos to them for recognizing that new </v>
<v Speaker 3>media has such a place and it's just </v>

232
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:08.874
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at this point I think that this </v>

233
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 3>whole concept of new media versus obese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just media,</v>

234
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 3>but there's independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncensored untethered media,</v>

235
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.330
<v Speaker 3>which is why one more popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

236
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.403
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

237
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.523
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tribe watching one of those ABC </v>

238
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 3>nightline or one of those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>political shows,</v>

239
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.723
<v Speaker 3>terror and then try watching something </v>
<v Speaker 3>on youtube where people get to be free </v>

240
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 3>with their language and free with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression,</v>

241
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:38.110
<v Speaker 3>not beholden to any executives are </v>
<v Speaker 3>producers and yeah,</v>

242
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 3>so they get it but they don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>

243
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Because when I went to the Chris </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christie thing,</v>

244
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 3>they had it in this giant room and about</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 percent of the room was full and then</v>

245
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 3>for one of my debates that I did a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>panels but one debate,</v>

246
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 3>they put me in like the smallest room </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had all the seats full and people</v>

247
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 3>standing up and packing the room so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get it but they don't get it.</v>

248
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Get it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>

249
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 3>the new media people are kind of like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>afterthought.</v>

250
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have them because you know,</v>

251
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 3>they should be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

252
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize that the draw is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Christie.</v>

253
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.430
<v Speaker 3>The draws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new media people.</v>

254
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Well Chris Christie and that's not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

255
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 3>but I just wanted to clear up under </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

256
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like who is he?</v>

257
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Why would they think that he could fill </v>
<v Speaker 3>a place because he's been on tv a lot,</v>

258
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 3>but I want to be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even just saying,</v>

259
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leftwing new media,</v>

260
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.430
<v Speaker 3>which obviously is what I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even the Ben Shapiro types,</v>

261
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 3>of course he has a big audience when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes.</v>

262
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:29.180
<v Speaker 3>He's got a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

263
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so.</v>

264
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 3>It's all the new media people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular and the rest of them are not.</v>

265
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Did you go to some sort of a concert </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you were there?</v>

266
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

267
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.633
<v Speaker 3>But they gave you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how you got in the building </v>

268
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 3>without them giving you a hard time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it forever.</v>

269
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just haven't.</v>

270
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about snipping it off </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

271
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>but now I'm wishing I did because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about it.</v>

272
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 3>There's some dorks that go to coachella </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they keep the fucking thing.</v>

273
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

274
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

275
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 3>This is coming off soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you.</v>

276
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Not Scared to</v>

277
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 1>take that big ass knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll cut off a finger by accident if I </v>

278
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 1>use that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be fun.</v>

279
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Just so everybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm talking about.</v>

280
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just gave you a pair of scissors </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want those.</v>

281
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

282
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:07.164
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take it off under pressure me if </v>

283
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:10.414
<v Speaker 1>you want to keep it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a bracelet guy in the first </v>

284
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.660
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a weird thing to be a bracelet</v>

285
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of beads,</v>

286
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>like you're really trying hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual.</v>

287
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Here we go and that's not me or ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want a diamond it up.</v>

288
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a rapper and you and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ice on your wrist.</v>

289
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I did use to wear earrings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did use to do that.</v>

290
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 1>And I see in your face that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mock me at this moment I had earrings.</v>

291
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.913
<v Speaker 1>Oh you did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably had the old nineties hoop </v>

292
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 1>earrings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a hoop and a diamond stud,</v>

293
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't even a diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a cubic Zirconia.</v>

294
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And has it ever happened in the history </v>

295
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.820
<v Speaker 1>of the world that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

296
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 1>a woman has walked up to a man and said </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a man,</v>

297
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't attracted to you,</v>

298
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.940
<v Speaker 1>but then I saw your earring probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the eighties.</v>

299
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Somebody probably said something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the eighties.</v>

300
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Just just because you're so bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a hole in your ear.</v>

301
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Took a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess that had a counter culture vibe </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

303
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:06.933
<v Speaker 1>You hearing little cutie man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a baby face know the other </v>

304
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>things just to earpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hook.</v>

305
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that goes back to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in place.</v>

306
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>So you only had it on one ear.</v>

307
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.613
<v Speaker 1>On the left hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't go like full rockstar with a </v>

308
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.923
<v Speaker 1>double hoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Axl Rose Word on the street is that if </v>

309
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:26.194
<v Speaker 1>you only do the right ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be a signal that </v>

310
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the word at one point in time.</v>

311
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 1>But is that true or is that just people </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking?</v>

312
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

313
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it on my left ear because that's </v>

314
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Speaker 1>what I had heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that too,</v>

315
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.213
<v Speaker 1>like don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could do both and that's not </v>

316
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>considered gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you did the right ear alone,</v>

317
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>that was considered good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you did both,</v>

318
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 1>either a pirate or you're in a band.</v>

319
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.703
<v Speaker 1>I did have both at one point and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny because when people see old </v>

320
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 1>pictures of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say I either look like the Jersey,</v>

321
00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.903
<v Speaker 1>like a jersey shore wannabe or like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstreet boys wanted me because I </v>

322
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 1>looked because I had the earrings in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the hair totally spiked and yeah,</v>

323
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that was the style at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you're also running a risk because</v>

324
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you've got like a little bit of facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

325
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

326
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a very masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No a beard,</v>

327
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:14.854
<v Speaker 1>but you've got something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're definitely a man or a woman </v>

328
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>undergoing hormone replacement therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got that Chaz Bono type thing.</v>

329
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:23.254
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is called a lazy man's beard </v>

330
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>because I can't even even really grow a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beard.</v>

331
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's just this is what it is when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get lazy.</v>

332
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You got a little something going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

333
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

334
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the finasteride just had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mustache itself.</v>

335
00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>That would be kind of creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No mustaches.</v>

336
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on a jihad against mustache </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think for whatever reason they</v>

337
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 1>look more ridiculous than full facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

338
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like,</v>

339
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 1>like Sam Elliott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actor.</v>

340
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

341
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I know Tom Selleck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen roadhouse,</v>

342
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but which guy is it enrolled?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows who.</v>

343
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not the main character of Patrick </v>
<v Speaker 1>swayze.</v>

344
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

345
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's got the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got the mustache.</v>

346
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 1>What a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the GRANDPA vibe going on,</v>

347
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.980
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't always go to roadhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to look at that.</v>

348
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Sam Elliott and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.043
<v Speaker 1>but he's a great voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's blowing him because he has a </v>

350
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:15.630
<v Speaker 1>mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy blow his fucking game area.</v>

351
00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.493
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that.</v>

352
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the one.</v>

353
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Love it with the hair right now there.</v>

354
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Are there that semen roadhouse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

355
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's a full beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more of a full beard.</v>

356
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that looks better on him.</v>

357
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

358
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:32.384
<v Speaker 1>come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a go to that one right </v>

359
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:36.284
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a goatee looks as </v>

360
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous as a mustache alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys can pull it off,</v>

361
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bold choice,</v>

362
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:45.530
<v Speaker 1>but he can't look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look overly artsy with it.</v>

363
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't or you can't.</v>

364
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:49.221
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

365
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:50.054
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it looks like you're tied to your </v>

366
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 1>goatee as a matter of your identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a problem.</v>

367
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.260
<v Speaker 1>But if it's just a dude who seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's rocking a goatee,</v>

368
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>he just decided one day to rock a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goatee,</v>

369
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:01.244
<v Speaker 1>then it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what kind of died out the soul </v>

370
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 1>patch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soul patch.</v>

371
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen one of those in forever.</v>

372
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of went away.</v>

373
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever have any facial hair or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

374
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:09.643
<v Speaker 1>just beard beards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew it way out at one point in time </v>

375
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.120
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

376
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named Evan Tanner who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>an mma fighter that was known for having</v>

377
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:18.430
<v Speaker 1>a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

378
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.263
<v Speaker 1>crazy beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a really interesting guy and he </v>

379
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 1>really nice guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he died in.</v>

380
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.783
<v Speaker 1>He went on sort of a walkabout and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to go in death valley and camp </v>

381
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 1>out and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ran out of water.</v>

382
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:33.884
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't find his water and dying from</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat and a lot of us were pretty broken </v>

383
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:40.814
<v Speaker 1>up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a bunch of people online decided to </v>

384
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 1>grow out our beards for a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of months.</v>

385
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 1>That's me with a full beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

386
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So you get a almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get a cave man.</v>

387
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Beard going if you wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

388
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I get a full beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's me trimming around the cheeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my shit creeps all the way up to</v>

390
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 1>my nostrils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew that out for a couple months.</v>

392
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I forget how long we decided to grow.</v>

393
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

394
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.873
<v Speaker 1>that was when he wanted to play Robert </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro didn't need to do that for the </v>

395
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Oj movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was okay.</v>

396
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

397
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that this verifies every single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

398
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.120
<v Speaker 1>whisper about John Travolta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tickle a Baltic or it is just a,</v>

399
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.580
<v Speaker 1>it's right there for typically involves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

400
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 1>so the Chris Christie thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in Politiken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's what?</v>

402
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 1>What was he doing exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you are.</v>

403
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>

404
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 1>You can play it if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

405
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle questions.</v>

406
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Chris Christie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti marijuana.</v>

407
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Watched</v>

408
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 4>that clip like 40 times over.</v>

409
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 1>You pause that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanna explain that to Joe.</v>

410
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>referencing there,</v>

411
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but during the Republican primary there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one debate where Chris Christie just</v>

412
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:02.364
<v Speaker 1>totally destroyed Marco Rubio's chances </v>
<v Speaker 1>of becoming president because he kept </v>

413
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:08.180
<v Speaker 1>repeating himself over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the same talking points and Chris</v>

414
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Christie pointed that out and then Mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rubio did it again and Chris,</v>

415
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

416
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>there he goes again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There he goes again,</v>

417
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:14.664
<v Speaker 1>and the room exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was that interaction where </v>

418
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>everybody where Rubio tanked in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polls and finished him off.</v>

419
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:20.874
<v Speaker 1>So my strategy with Christie was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start this off by giving </v>

420
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>them credit on something to disarm him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm gonna hit him with the real</v>

421
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 1>question for a sport</v>

422
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.423
<v Speaker 4>in regards to the opioid epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you care deeply about that generation </v>

423
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.713
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to study in the Journal of the American </v>

424
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.101
<v Speaker 4>Medical Association,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legal,</v>

425
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:45.934
<v Speaker 4>recreational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana would help fight the opioid </v>

426
00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:48.454
<v Speaker 4>epidemic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so knowing that and knowing that 62 </v>

427
00:18:51.221 --> 00:18:54.490
<v Speaker 4>percent of Americans now favor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>favor full legalization,</v>

428
00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 4>why not supportive</v>

429
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.430
<v Speaker 5>play out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let it play</v>

430
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.603
<v Speaker 4>epidemiological studies from Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 4>Medical School for Stanford to tell you </v>

431
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:09.850
<v Speaker 4>the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

432
00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:10.684
<v Speaker 4>Pause right there.</v>

433
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 1>His giant problems with epidemiology </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies and he should know that.</v>

434
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my studies for sure,</v>

435
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 1>epidemic epidemiology studies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a questionnaires,</v>

436
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

437
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:24.924
<v Speaker 1>you don't take into account all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other issues that these people do in </v>

438
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:27.714
<v Speaker 1>their lives and also like when when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with those kinds of </v>

439
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:31.254
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person could be doing marijuana but </v>

440
00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 1>also be drinking a lot but also be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

441
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So if what the argument is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gateway drug,</v>

442
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.930
<v Speaker 1>the only way that argument works is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you somehow or another track someone and</v>

443
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:47.094
<v Speaker 1>saw that marijuana made them change </v>
<v Speaker 1>their opinion on doing other drugs </v>

444
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.043
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of these people are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing drugs and they do marijuana as </v>

445
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:55.981
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't say,</v>

446
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:56.814
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've shown these through these </v>

447
00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:58.824
<v Speaker 1>epidemiology studies that marijuana is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gateway drug because they started </v>

448
00:20:02.311 --> 00:20:04.350
<v Speaker 1>smoking marijuana and then they went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do heroin.</v>

449
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 1>They probably were going to do heroin </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

450
00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

451
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.660
<v Speaker 1>That's really what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

452
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking gateway drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole idea has been dismissed.</v>

453
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:17.420
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying water is a gateway </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug to rape every rapist,</v>

454
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 1>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

455
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is the almost that stupid.</v>

456
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that when there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of applause,</v>

457
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:24.684
<v Speaker 1>because he answered me quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that that beginning of the </v>

458
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:27.684
<v Speaker 1>applause was for my question or for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him saying no and respond hundred </v>

459
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.460
<v Speaker 1>percent for you because we were debating</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

460
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's do it again.</v>

461
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Play it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really clear.</v>

462
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:40.443
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

463
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't tell epidemiological</v>

464
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.870
<v Speaker 4>studies for both Harvard Medical Schools</v>
<v Speaker 4>here in this effort,</v>

465
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Stafford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that tell you the exact opposite and say</v>

466
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:55.144
<v Speaker 4>that marijuana is still a gateway drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that people who try marijuana </v>

467
00:20:58.481 --> 00:20:59.314
<v Speaker 4>between the ages of 14 and 18 are three </v>
<v Speaker 4>times more likely three times more </v>

468
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:07.921
<v Speaker 4>likely to try opioids or </v>
<v Speaker 4>methamphetamines than people who don't,</v>

469
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.513
<v Speaker 4>and I just don't believe that what we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the midst of a drug addiction crisis </v>

470
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.690
<v Speaker 4>that we need to legalize and other </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

471
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.103
<v Speaker 6>Clearly he's got a food addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Food addiction is far more dangerous </v>

472
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.100
<v Speaker 6>than marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Marijuana on its own has killed.</v>

473
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.053
<v Speaker 6>No one ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Half a million people die every year </v>

474
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 6>from being a fat fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>

475
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 6>That's the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

476
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 6>This guy is a part of a real death </v>
<v Speaker 6>epidemic and if you were mean,</v>

477
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.593
<v Speaker 6>you would bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This motherfucker brings a fucking bank </v>

478
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.440
<v Speaker 6>robber size bag of m and m's to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>football game.</v>

479
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 6>He's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's ridiculous.</v>

480
00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:54.280
<v Speaker 6>Talking about marijuana and marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 6>being a gateway drug.</v>

481
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.263
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea of it is stupid like </v>
<v Speaker 6>smoke marijuana or don't smoke </v>

482
00:21:58.001 --> 00:21:58.834
<v Speaker 6>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the point is marijuana doesn't kill </v>

483
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really that simple.</v>

484
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.053
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're saying that marijuana causes </v>

485
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:05.884
<v Speaker 6>you to do all sorts of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got to have some direct pathway </v>

486
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 6>that shows that it changes your </v>
<v Speaker 6>inhibitions.</v>

487
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:12.580
<v Speaker 6>It changes the way you think about </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

488
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 6>That's never been done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If anything,</v>

489
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.403
<v Speaker 6>what gets people to try drugs is when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you tell them that marijuana is </v>

490
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 6>dangerous and then they smoke marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 6>and go,</v>

491
00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 6>this is Shane dangerous not doing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel great the next day.</v>

492
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:28.210
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All it does eat a pizza.</v>

493
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.000
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a giggle.</v>

494
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.510
<v Speaker 6>I watched a bunch of cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My friends.</v>

495
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:32.344
<v Speaker 6>We had a great fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is the misinformation aspect of it </v>

496
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 6>is more dangerous than the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a kate.</v>

497
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 6>Some sort of a gateway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree with all of that.</v>

498
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to pounce when he said that,</v>

499
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 6>but you have to understand this was his </v>
<v Speaker 6>town hall,</v>

500
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 6>so I knew that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

501
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:49.744
<v Speaker 6>I was going to be shoved to the side </v>
<v Speaker 6>very quickly anyway because there was a </v>

502
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 6>whole big line behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be wrong about people clapping.</v>

503
00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 6>They might have really clear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said that was wrong.</v>

504
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:57.424
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure some of the people in the room </v>
<v Speaker 6>were there to see him and they agree </v>

505
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 6>with him because it was his town hall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I wanted to pounce,</v>

506
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:06.040
<v Speaker 6>but I knew I can't really go back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>forth like it's a debate.</v>

507
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 6>So what I did is whenever I knew I could</v>
<v Speaker 6>interject just a little bit,</v>

508
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 6>I pushed him on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you're gonna see that in a second.</v>

509
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 6>What is a weird background with like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bird?</v>

510
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 6>It's in 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Backdrop that they put up,</v>

511
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.790
<v Speaker 6>but what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does it say?</v>

512
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 6>It's as political as it says.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Polydoconol with a weird.</v>

513
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 6>A weird drawing is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

514
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

515
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.550
<v Speaker 4>But I wouldn't what we do alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>toothpaste back in the tube.</v>

516
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's a big important article about</v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana because once you legalize this</v>

517
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.960
<v Speaker 4>goes back to the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it because we tried.</v>

518
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 4>It's called prohibition and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

519
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.560
<v Speaker 4>She didn't stay legal in California </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's fine.</v>

520
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hit the states,</v>

521
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 4>have the right to do what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do on this,</v>

522
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.763
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I would tell you is that broad </v>

523
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 4>legalization of marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my view,</v>

524
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.953
<v Speaker 4>to alleviate or even minimize your </v>
<v Speaker 4>current prices and in fact in some ways </v>

525
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:14.114
<v Speaker 4>may add to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I will also say that I almost never </v>

526
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 4>agreed with the teacher's union in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>state anywhere,</v>

527
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.163
<v Speaker 4>but the Colorado Education Association </v>
<v Speaker 4>has said this year that the single </v>

528
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.193
<v Speaker 4>biggest challenge for their members to </v>
<v Speaker 4>educate middle schoolers and high </v>

529
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 4>schoolers in Colorado legalized </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

530
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.683
<v Speaker 4>that kids are coming with gummy bears </v>
<v Speaker 4>and other types of edibles and their </v>

531
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:41.400
<v Speaker 4>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their high,</v>

532
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.253
<v Speaker 4>the good part of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's making it much more difficult </v>

533
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:45.134
<v Speaker 4>for them to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the Colorado Education </v>

534
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 4>Association.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

535
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure at this very moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were watching,</v>

536
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.300
<v Speaker 4>will be appalled to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>

537
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.900
<v Speaker 4>I agree with them on that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it.</v>

538
00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 4>I respectfully disagree with your point </v>
<v Speaker 4>of view.</v>

539
00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.653
<v Speaker 4>Thank you sir.</v>

540
00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.653
<v Speaker 1>So he actually changed his position </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly because when he ran for </v>

541
00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:04.774
<v Speaker 1>president he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only am I against marijuana being </v>

542
00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:07.234
<v Speaker 1>illegal at a federal level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even let the individual </v>

543
00:25:09.491 --> 00:25:12.790
<v Speaker 1>states decide whether or not they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal marijuana.</v>

544
00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:13.624
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would prosecute the states like </v>

545
00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and California that have legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana using federal law.</v>

546
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And right there he softened his position</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly and he said,</v>

547
00:25:21.281 --> 00:25:22.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave it up to the states and let them </v>

548
00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:23.464
<v Speaker 1>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything that's because he knows </v>

549
00:25:25.061 --> 00:25:26.650
<v Speaker 1>he'll never be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

550
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:27.484
<v Speaker 1>I think he still wants to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking way I think he's </v>

551
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:31.030
<v Speaker 1>going to run again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

552
00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's going to run in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 20,</v>

553
00:25:32.651 --> 00:25:35.380
<v Speaker 1>but 20 slash 20 for some serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

554
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.333
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds of that guy's going to make it </v>

555
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.240
<v Speaker 1>eight more years with that fair point.</v>

556
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Morbidly obese carcass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's moving his hand around with does it</v>

557
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.520
<v Speaker 1>need get a stapler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he get his stomach fucking suit?</v>

558
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody pointed that out.</v>

559
00:25:51.281 --> 00:25:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw those stories.</v>

560
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not denying that it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just never heard it.</v>

561
00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:56.734
<v Speaker 1>But if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work while I had a friend who </v>

562
00:25:59.081 --> 00:26:00.720
<v Speaker 1>ate through two of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

563
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.750
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.400
<v Speaker 1>when you're a d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying anyway,</v>

565
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:05.980
<v Speaker 1>about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's addicted to food that's like,</v>

566
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.220
<v Speaker 1>this is unquestionably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an addict.</v>

567
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you think anybody's said that to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his life or an I look.</v>

568
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Look how much thinner you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

569
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did this.</v>

570
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he did this before the </v>

571
00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:18.940
<v Speaker 1>presidential race because he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

572
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.900
<v Speaker 1>But then he got fat again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

573
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.343
<v Speaker 1>So he was wrote ton before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like a bag of water before and </v>

574
00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:29.280
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

575
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.700
<v Speaker 1>he trimmed himself down.</v>

576
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because I don't think in </v>

577
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:36.880
<v Speaker 1>any way he realizes the hypocrisy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having his own,</v>

578
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 1>issue with food and he would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

580
00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:41.284
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to eat what I want it to </v>

581
00:26:41.711 --> 00:26:42.544
<v Speaker 1>freedom choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when comes to freedom for somebody </v>

582
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>to decide to tweak their consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly,</v>

583
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:48.420
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be allowed to do that.</v>

584
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's preposterous.</v>

585
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:50.574
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you mean even with what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said about alcohol didn't make any </v>

586
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would you make alcohol illegal?</v>

587
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 1>What we try to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called prohibition.</v>

588
00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's pretend that you had some sort</v>

589
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 1>of an ability to keep that from going </v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways.</v>

590
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start from the beginning.</v>

591
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Would you want alcohol to be legal or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>

592
00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 1>If you could wave your hand and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be no more problems that are</v>

593
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>alcohol associated.</v>

594
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.833
<v Speaker 1>Would you do that and make it illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus give a grown adult the </v>

595
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 1>possibility of deciding whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to drink or not drink?</v>

596
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not being consistent and his logic,</v>

597
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.620
<v Speaker 1>that's the point is that he's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say I'm thinking about donuts,</v>

598
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but he even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even mentioned prohibition there,</v>

599
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 1>but that makes my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not his point.</v>

600
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:36.954
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's when the mafia got </v>

601
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:38.664
<v Speaker 1>incredibly powerful because you pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the alcohol sales underground and </v>

602
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:42.684
<v Speaker 1>they got all the power and the money is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of it and that's when crime a </v>

603
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 1>shot through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to decrease violent crime</v>

604
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.060
<v Speaker 1>and the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

605
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

606
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:55.020
<v Speaker 1>we talked to people in Mexico and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and our hunger for illegal</v>

607
00:27:55.981 --> 00:28:00.300
<v Speaker 1>drugs is a reason why the cartel got so </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge when we were kids.</v>

608
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.170
<v Speaker 1>When I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no Mexican cartel.</v>

609
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was never discussed.</v>

610
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It was not an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no discussion whatsoever about</v>

611
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 1>violence from Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an incredibly recent thing.</v>

612
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did MTV spring break,</v>

613
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:21.203
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was back in 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hosting this spring break thing </v>

614
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:28.524
<v Speaker 1>for MTV when fear factor was just on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air and it was like one of those </v>

615
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:37.580
<v Speaker 1>publicity things that we did and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no worries about going to Mexico.</v>

616
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Mexico 10 was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

617
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:41.160
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to Mexico.</v>

618
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:41.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

619
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:42.031
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

620
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go to new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico was no different.</v>

621
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

622
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>and now it's like you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

623
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:47.994
<v Speaker 1>What about the gangs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the violence would have put </v>

624
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:52.200
<v Speaker 1>the cartel people would go to Tijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

625
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And you would worry because it was seedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crazy and you know,</v>

626
00:28:56.191 --> 00:29:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of pickpockets and thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was never cartel violence.</v>

627
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Cartel violence is literally within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 15 years or so,</v>

628
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and our strategy had the opposite of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect they wanted.</v>

629
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 1>So you get rid of El Chapo and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

630
00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the decapitation strategy,</v>

631
00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:14.730
<v Speaker 1>we got rid of the top guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're good.</v>

632
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.683
<v Speaker 1>But what happened is you had his cartel </v>
<v Speaker 1>became fractionalized and then you had </v>

633
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:19.944
<v Speaker 1>people fighting who were top officials </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his cartel and they both wanted to </v>

634
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:24.564
<v Speaker 1>become the head guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then there's a war between those </v>

635
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.174
<v Speaker 1>guys and their gangs in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the exact opposite of what they </v>

636
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 1>say they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is let's decrease the violence and</v>

637
00:29:32.251 --> 00:29:33.960
<v Speaker 1>make sure everything's running </v>
<v Speaker 1>peacefully.</v>

638
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 1>And also an amazing fact that I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned about a few weeks ago.</v>

639
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.530
<v Speaker 1>There are 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths that have happened as a result of</v>

640
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 1>the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>

641
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.960
<v Speaker 1>that's crazier in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know the US and Mexico.</v>

642
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 1>That seems low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that's low?</v>

643
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

644
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I guess because it's been going on since</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan,</v>

645
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 1>so one would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

646
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it's more Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry Nixon,</v>

647
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:56.580
<v Speaker 1>not Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

648
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but that was like inside the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

649
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:05.190
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be like how do you classify </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what was done because the drug war,</v>

650
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go with all the stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in Vietnam with heroin.</v>

651
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many people were killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>including via.</v>

652
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:13.863
<v Speaker 1>I think this is just for theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s and Mexico and I think it's tied to </v>

653
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.403
<v Speaker 1>what we were just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cartel violence and then people get </v>

654
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>caught in the crossfire and they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives destroyed.</v>

655
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.160
<v Speaker 1>It still seems low to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

656
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's over a trillion dollars has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been wasted on this.</v>

657
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd be interested in talking to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is an expert,</v>

658
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.003
<v Speaker 1>get Chris Christie on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who's a real expert on Mexico and </v>

659
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 1>what happened with the cartels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise.</v>

660
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.703
<v Speaker 1>The cartels because I'm sure there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always organized violence in organized </v>

661
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:45.070
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like what happened where it exploded</v>

662
00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 1>to the point where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

663
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:47.703
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking to a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>who said he won't go to Mexico and I'm </v>

664
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in Mexico,</v>

665
00:30:51.151 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is great.</v>

666
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.313
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about a Punto Meta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever go to [inaudible] to me now </v>

667
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like near Puerto Vallarta.</v>

668
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 1>It's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So beautiful.</v>

669
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:04.291
<v Speaker 1>But we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were staying at a resort and A.</v>

670
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.213
<v Speaker 1>I was with my family and they have these</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf carts that you could drive around </v>

671
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the resort on and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the town.</v>

672
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.573
<v Speaker 1>Let's go see what that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a town right outside of the </v>

673
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 1>resort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go see what it's like.</v>

674
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:21.210
<v Speaker 1>You go out of the resort in a block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit a military station where there's</v>

675
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 1>men that are standing by on armored </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles.</v>

676
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.180
<v Speaker 1>So I said to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

677
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 1>do you know why they're there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there to guard the resort.</v>

678
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I know that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

679
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you really think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

680
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:34.834
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why are they standing here on top of </v>

681
00:31:37.301 --> 00:31:38.134
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these steel plates with </v>

682
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:40.894
<v Speaker 1>machine guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys have flak jackets on and </v>

683
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:46.510
<v Speaker 1>they're standing there on top of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>military vehicles standing there.</v>

684
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

685
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 1>they're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on standby.</v>

686
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.000
<v Speaker 1>This fucking thing is right outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gates of the four C's.</v>

687
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to make sure that they protect </v>

688
00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Speaker 1>their tourism industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

689
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's all directly tied to the drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>war will.</v>

690
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:05.610
<v Speaker 1>The drug war has had a massive impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acapulco Aco.</v>

691
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Poco used to be the place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would go.</v>

692
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.123
<v Speaker 1>They said the Vegas of Mexico and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to rival Vegas and now </v>

693
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that's where they say there's mega </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartel violence.</v>

694
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't even call them cartels now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will say there are mega cartels.</v>

695
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.480
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting for more power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then not only that,</v>

696
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.343
<v Speaker 1>there's been some violence where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposely killed people that were </v>

697
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 1>staying in resorts to sort of send a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message like,</v>

698
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.900
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

699
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 1>and there's dead politicians to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found these mass graves.</v>

700
00:32:31.391 --> 00:32:32.224
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then they'll stumble </v>

701
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:38.050
<v Speaker 1>across a 200 person mass grave and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's not being killed,</v>

702
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.420
<v Speaker 1>they're usually being by the cartels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some experts.</v>

703
00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I've said this is literally a narco </v>
<v Speaker 1>state at this point and I'm curious what</v>

704
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:45.824
<v Speaker 1>this new guy's going to do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's new guys supposed to be </v>

705
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 1>anticorruption and hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what his position is on the</v>

706
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:53.450
<v Speaker 1>drug war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be surprised if his position was</v>

707
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:54.261
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

708
00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>let's find another way to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now world opinion has shifted.</v>

709
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US,</v>

710
00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 1>62 percent of the country says let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalize marijuana.</v>

711
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are thinking that without</v>

712
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 1>even realizing that there's a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>spike in crime because it's illegal.</v>

713
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

714
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.173
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are also killing journalists </v>

715
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're killing police.</v>

716
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico because the cartel violence,</v>

717
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that Jamal could </v>

718
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Shogi guy before the podcast started and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how disturbing this whole thing is.</v>

719
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.720
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who don't know what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

720
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.700
<v Speaker 1>fill people in on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

721
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

722
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:34.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Mollica Shogi is uh,</v>

723
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:35.614
<v Speaker 1>a journalist who actually worked for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post and he went into the </v>

724
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.693
<v Speaker 1>Saudi embassy in Turkey to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage license in Istanbul to get a </v>

725
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:48.470
<v Speaker 1>marriage license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for him and his wife and he never got</v>

726
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed him,</v>

727
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 1>dismembered him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used a bone saw,</v>

728
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 1>and then they even went as far as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover it up or they had a body double go</v>

729
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:56.264
<v Speaker 1>in and they gave him a fake beard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had him wear his clothes and walk </v>

730
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:00.060
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

731
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Is there video of the body double?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

732
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

733
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:04.064
<v Speaker 1>CNN had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know yesterday I was looking at the </v>

734
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 1>CNN video that had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

735
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.690
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

736
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 1>now brazenly killing journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you what,</v>

737
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.370
<v Speaker 1>you came up with a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of the story.</v>

738
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why they did it.</v>

739
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Here's the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go,</v>

740
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>there's him and then the guy on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right with hair.</v>

741
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Why would they have a guy with hair as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>body double?</v>

742
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Think about how much this had to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned out to have a body double.</v>

743
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why they give the body was bubble.</v>

744
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double shave your head dude.</v>

745
00:34:29.951 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 1>The other guy's bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

746
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't even do a good job at </v>
<v Speaker 1>faking their murder,</v>

747
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:37.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's the worst fake ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

748
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.320
<v Speaker 1>because the guy's got a full head of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

749
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not great.</v>

750
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Not Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How shoes onto.</v>

751
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.310
<v Speaker 1>He had different shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

752
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst body double.</v>

753
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 1>It's got dark hair and they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy.</v>

754
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fine walking around.</v>

755
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.890
<v Speaker 1>No issues at the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double Knot.</v>

756
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 1>A hair double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

757
00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're going to have a body </v>
<v Speaker 1>double shave.</v>

758
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 1>The guy's fucking heads how you walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those different shirt and everything.</v>

759
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a body devil.</v>

760
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.860
<v Speaker 1>So says hair color is different too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

761
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 1>he's got dark hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got gray here.</v>

762
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.273
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's driving me nuts about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so now at this is getting a lot </v>

763
00:35:13.731 --> 00:35:15.740
<v Speaker 1>of press attention and I'm happy it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a lot of press attention,</v>

764
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why it is is because he's</v>

765
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:19.214
<v Speaker 1>part of the elite class in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's a journalist and now you have </v>

766
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:23.580
<v Speaker 1>the people from the New York Times and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Washington Post and CNN,</v>

767
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 1>they can relate and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

768
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:25.730
<v Speaker 1>they're killing journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

769
00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the precedent that this sets,</v>

770
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.680
<v Speaker 1>but what people don't know is for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past two or three years,</v>

771
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.573
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia has been waging a literal </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide in Yemen and that's not an </v>

772
00:35:35.331 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 1>exaggeration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they've blockaded the.</v>

773
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.003
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowing in medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a cholera epidemic happening </v>

774
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.790
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions of people are sick.</v>

775
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.833
<v Speaker 1>They have people dying of starvation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not allowing in food or </v>

776
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bombing hospitals,</v>

777
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 1>they're bombing schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bombing open air markets,</v>

778
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 1>so they're doing a literal genocide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that got very little coverage,</v>

779
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 1>but then with this journalist now </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally starting to get some coverage,</v>

780
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:57.384
<v Speaker 1>but I'm curious what happens moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in terms of how will the US </v>

781
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:00.594
<v Speaker 1>respond to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as I'm sure you already know </v>

782
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:02.994
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they care more about that </v>

783
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 1>$110,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons deal that they just had with the</v>

784
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Saudis than they do about the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities or the lives of journalists.</v>

785
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

786
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 1>The idea of him being really valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

787
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that he's a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite.</v>

788
00:36:16.971 --> 00:36:20.980
<v Speaker 1>It's that there was a conspiracy to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they think came from upon high.</v>

789
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was 15 people that they're </v>

790
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.414
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew in from Saudi Arabia and one of </v>

791
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:30.810
<v Speaker 1>them was a forensics expert who knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to cover up evidence,</v>

792
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 1>knows what evidence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's like a movie.</v>

793
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.390
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bone saw things that been confirmed.</v>

794
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 1>They know that well at a bone saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that now the nickname for him in</v>

795
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would they say?</v>

796
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Bone saw a solomon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is Mohammed bin Salman.</v>

797
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 1>They're calling them bone saw Solomon or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

798
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

799
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:50.154
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that's going on is just scary </v>

800
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 1>to me and then there's also some </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting geopolitical stuff happening</v>

801
00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:55.284
<v Speaker 1>around this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head of Turkey is now using this as </v>

802
00:36:57.361 --> 00:36:58.194
<v Speaker 1>an issue to try to snuggle up to the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's got ambitions where he </v>

803
00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:02.154
<v Speaker 1>wants to like recreate the Ottoman </v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire and of course Muhammad Bin </v>

<v Speaker 1>Solomon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has ambitions where he wants to </v>

805
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:07.374
<v Speaker 1>dominate the Middle East so you have at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time this weird ego battle </v>

806
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:15.000
<v Speaker 1>between [inaudible] and Mohammed bin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salman and they're all trying to suck up</v>

807
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:18.430
<v Speaker 1>to the US to basically get it so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

808
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:23.470
<v Speaker 1>We do favors for them and we allow them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to expand and on top of that,</v>

809
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the story's changed multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

810
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.493
<v Speaker 1>It's a story of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five times first they said nothing </v>

811
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.780
<v Speaker 1>happened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>

812
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Then they said we walked out fight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're saying that he was killed by</v>

813
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 1>people who overstep their bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

814
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep changing the story and there's</v>

815
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.253
<v Speaker 1>also stories that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consulate has video and audio </v>

816
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 1>evidence of the murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Turkey saying?</v>

817
00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to release it </v>

818
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:50.664
<v Speaker 1>because then people will know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spying on them when they visit </v>

819
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:54.930
<v Speaker 1>the consulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

820
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll take your word for it.</v>

821
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

822
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.303

823
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:00.834
<v Speaker 1>brought up yesterday that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to release this video and audio </v>

824
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:05.784
<v Speaker 1>evidence because if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then other people will know how they're </v>

825
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>spying on them when they visit.</v>

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.343
<v Speaker 1>They need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent of women were </v>

918
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 1>getting discriminated against in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world of superhero movies is only wonder</v>

919
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she sought his fucking half naked.</v>

920
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Who played wonder woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gal Gadot.</v>

921
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Israelis something.</v>

922
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't she in the IDF Israeli military?</v>

923
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I think she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

924
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

925
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Marquez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was just here.</v>

926
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Marcus Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

927
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:10.953
<v Speaker 1>he was showing how she got busted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was doing some campaign for Huawei </v>

928
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 1>phones and she tweeted it using an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone.</v>

929
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that man.</v>

930
00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I would only push a product that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really agree with and believe in.</v>

931
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.833
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who was doing Samsung </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials and the entire time he was </v>

932
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:33.980
<v Speaker 1>using an iphone and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they catch me using an iphone,</v>

933
00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:37.700
<v Speaker 1>they'll fire me and I don't care if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>using a fucking iphone.</v>

934
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So he had his iphone and the Samsung </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

935
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 1>but he never used a samsung phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All his friends,</v>

936
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.030
<v Speaker 1>he would text everybody or that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do.</v>

937
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 1>We'd do on the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they just hire somebody who</v>

938
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:53.351
<v Speaker 1>loves Samsung and is popular because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could do that better yet.</v>

939
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 1>They should just looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Sam.</v>

940
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 1>This was a long time ago though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that,</v>

941
00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.253
<v Speaker 1>that this was probably six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six years ago and back then the </v>

942
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:07.634
<v Speaker 1>phones were not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a big difference between </v>

943
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:10.814
<v Speaker 1>the iphone and android phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's not really that much of a </v>

944
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both pretty fucking awesome.</v>

945
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that they just hire someone </v>

946
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.790
<v Speaker 1>who's got some fucking integrity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't lock [inaudible] yeah.</v>

947
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.110
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

948
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:25.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of married to iphone by default</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been stuck with it since </v>

949
00:43:27.041 --> 00:43:27.874
<v Speaker 1>the iphone four and I'm just too lazy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because I don't even know exactly </v>

950
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:34.670
<v Speaker 1>which things transfer over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I were to go to a totally new phone,</v>

951
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously nothing almost,</v>

952
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.393
<v Speaker 1>but what about my number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they be able to do that with my </v>

953
00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>number at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or no?</v>

954
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

955
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.063
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even your number would be a giant issue </v>

956
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 1>because you're married to the right chat</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm.</v>

957
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:46.903
<v Speaker 1>I've messaged and that I messaged thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about in the last </v>

958
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:50.714
<v Speaker 1>podcast that I bought a pixel and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to switch over to a pixel from an </v>

959
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:55.004
<v Speaker 1>iphone and my text messages wouldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it because everyone was texting </v>

960
00:43:59.871 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 1>me using an I message and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending it to a pixel.</v>

961
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of turn to text then send to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

962
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.143
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

963
00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.250
<v Speaker 1>So that it was just disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

964
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.113
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically making it incredibly </v>

965
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:12.944
<v Speaker 1>difficult for you to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I even called up apple and have them </v>

966
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:19.480
<v Speaker 1>take out my email from their system </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know my email is attached,</v>

967
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the imessage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so take this out for the system,</v>

968
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>kill my message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kill the whole system.</v>

969
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Still wouldn't work.</v>

970
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I had wound up going back to apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mother fuckers.</v>

971
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.723
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how because I know you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken about it many times so you're </v>

972
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:34.360
<v Speaker 1>kind of a techie in the sense that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always get like the new phones and stuff</v>

973
00:44:34.361 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>here for with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

974
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the dumbest techies that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked the face of the planet,</v>

975
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but I was to say I don't know how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with stuff.</v>

976
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm into stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like stuff,</v>

977
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:42.954
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a guy who really likes cars </v>

978
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but as zero idea how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's prudy.</v>

979
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 1>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

980
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 1>But you still go through the hassle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordering it and.</v>

981
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.601
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

982
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:55.434
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a pain in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would use the same phone for 10 years </v>

983
00:44:57.841 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 1>if I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

984
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not something I think of.</v>

985
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:01.770
<v Speaker 1>What do I use it for?</v>

986
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I use it to text people and every now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then call and that's it.</v>

987
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.053
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated by technology and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>always interested in where it's going </v>

988
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:10.734
<v Speaker 1>and what they've got going on next and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and what's the latest and the </v>

989
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 1>greatest augmented reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

990
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting because that's</v>

991
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be the next big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

992
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 1>The how we could see because the phone I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

993
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a new new iphone,</v>

994
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but you could do augmented reality games</v>
<v Speaker 1>on so I could look like they're building</v>

995
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>blocks in the middle of this table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a game where,</v>

996
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:32.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever member.</v>

997
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.113
<v Speaker 1>When pokemon was hot and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving down the street playing pokemon </v>

998
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.143
<v Speaker 1>in their car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were driving crashing into trees </v>

999
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

1001
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I used when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved pokemon.</v>

1002
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.373
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon came and went so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point where everyone was using </v>

1003
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:54.130
<v Speaker 1>pokemon for like months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.013
<v Speaker 1>And then it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the new one that </v>

1005
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 1>everyone's using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did we all a game boy?</v>

1007
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I used to play it as a kid and then if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back,</v>

1008
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 1>like I tried to turn it on maybe two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago to just see what it's like.</v>

1009
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It is the shittiest most basic game </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1010
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.873
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty wack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty wack in comparison in what </v>

1011
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.500
<v Speaker 1>it showed me when people really got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pokemon game is that people have,</v>

1012
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:20.423
<v Speaker 1>people are very easily amused and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to turn them onto some new latest </v>

1013
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 1>trend in latest trend being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you have to do jeff,</v>

1014
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.970
<v Speaker 1>to go out and get things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the,</v>

1015
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.090
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you had to walk to where there were</v>

1016
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:35.720
<v Speaker 1>pokemon who were going to fight you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would,</v>

1017
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I think fight them.</v>

1018
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 1>And then if you beat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have them in your collection,</v>

1019
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.690
<v Speaker 1>your video game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not the newest one.</v>

1020
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:43.993
<v Speaker 1>Fight them would you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my understanding is you go into the </v>

1021
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:46.944
<v Speaker 1>APP and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be made fun of me right now </v>

1022
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>because I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're walking around with the phone</v>

1023
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:50.941
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1024
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the corner,</v>

1025
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make a right.</v>

1026
00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I see a pokemon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go down there and then,</v>

1027
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:57.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fight that pokemon and I guess make </v>

1028
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 1>your stronger and catch that one I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way it works.</v>

1029
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 1>You sound like you're bored by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

1030
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:08.551

<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1033
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:12.893
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was also one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people were losing weight because </v>

1034
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:15.624
<v Speaker 1>they were walking around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were touting the positive </v>

1035
00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 1>benefits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look,</v>

1036
00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:19.434
<v Speaker 1>people love walking for miles kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio compared to the cardio you've </v>

1037
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:23.034
<v Speaker 1>been doing is like absolutely nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tired.</v>

<v Speaker 1>minutes because I have a podcast in </v>

<v Speaker 1>Solid two and a half hours.</v>

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard and I'm listening to.</v>

1062
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.613
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to stuff to blow your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind when they were talking about a </v>

1063
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 1>flying creatures are quite so quantile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and terror attack titles and the origins</v>

1064
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:38.914
<v Speaker 1>of the quantal.</v>

1065

<v Speaker 1>A myth in as tech Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could watch like the full length</v>

1066
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 1>movie of the titanic as your workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched a bunch of movies,</v>

1067
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 1>like yesterday I watched two solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>

1068
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I finally got to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out,</v>

1069
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.150
<v Speaker 1>never saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out was great.</v>

1070
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked.</v>

1071
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 1>That was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good move.</v>

1072
00:48:58.211 --> 00:48:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Those again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie like,</v>

1073
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that girl is so evil.</v>

1074
00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second Annual Pokemon go fast draws over</v>

1075
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 1>21,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>attendees in Chicago.</v>

1076
00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So there's over 180,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that played Chicago.</v>

1077
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.443
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when Hillary Clinton is </v>

1078
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.223
<v Speaker 1>still played it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Hillary Clinton </v>

1079
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.430
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right everybody,</v>

1080
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I need you to poke a mon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the polls.</v>

1081
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody in the audience was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ditching.</v>

1082
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 1>You never saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1083
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1084
00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:36.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a progressive but you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a democrat.</v>

1085
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1086
00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:42.871
<v Speaker 1>you're not necessarily like in support </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anyone who's not a loyal Democrat.</v>

1087
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 1>So I describe myself as populous left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would describe myself.</v>

1088
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Populist means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1089
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I support the policies that would help </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people.</v>

1090
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I vote based on the issues.</v>

1091
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.660
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's a politician that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the policies I'm for,</v>

1092
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.030
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm going to support and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm going to argue for.</v>

1093
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm very,</v>

1094
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>very critical of what we call corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>

1095
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:09.910
<v Speaker 1>which are Democrats that represent Wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Street and represent big Pharma and,</v>

1096
00:50:09.911 --> 00:50:10.744
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military industrial complex and for </v>

1097
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:12.964
<v Speaker 1>profit health insurance companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm super critical of the </v>

1098
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Republicans also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1099
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:18.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I co founded a group called </v>

1100
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Justice Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole idea was to basically do a</v>

1101
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.600
<v Speaker 1>populace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left takeover,</v>

1102
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party where you get rid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the corporatists in the party and you</v>

1103
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 1>have people who will represent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>

1104
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been pretty successful so far.</v>

1105
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 1>They're still 26 justice Democrats were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the running and they can get elected.</v>

1106
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 1>And there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an amazing fact.</v>

1107
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:40.244
<v Speaker 1>There were four politicians in the House</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Representatives that didn't take any </v>

1108
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 1>corporate PAC money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's about to be 41.</v>

1109
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 1>And that'll happen because of Justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats.</v>

1110
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Our evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Bernie Sanders Group,</v>

1111
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:52.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the d triple c,</v>

1112
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:53.384
<v Speaker 1>which is another left wing organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what's happening is a </v>

1113
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.093
<v Speaker 1>people on the left who actually care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the substantive issues are </v>

1114
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 1>standing up and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to take it anymore.</v>

1115
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.793
<v Speaker 1>And we're tired of being lied to by </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians and we want people who are </v>

1116
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 1>going to actually represent us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent working people.</v>

1117
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:10.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1118
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:11.543
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love that approach and there's so </v>

1119
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 1>much partisan politics and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people that are just married to the</v>

1120
00:51:17.031 --> 00:51:17.864
<v Speaker 1>idea of being connected to the Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're willing to overlook some </v>

1121
00:51:22.011 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 1>really heinous faults.</v>

1122
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Any old blue just won't do as Nina </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turner says that,</v>

1123
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:28.454
<v Speaker 1>and I love that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great phrase because it's so just hacky </v>

1124
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.190
<v Speaker 1>and partisan to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1125
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm on your team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so are you going to vote for me here?</v>

1126
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:37.364
<v Speaker 1>Let me do some platitudes and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliches about how we're stronger </v>

1127
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:41.750
<v Speaker 1>together and we're going to break down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the barriers.</v>

1128
00:51:41.751 --> 00:51:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1129
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't overtly hate minorities,</v>

1130
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:48.050
<v Speaker 1>so vote for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1131
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:49.330
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a low bar.</v>

1132
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Give people something to vote for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great point.</v>

1133
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I felt a lot of that during the Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton campaign.</v>

1134
00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like anything but trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to vote for her.</v>

1135
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.450
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1136
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:05.420
<v Speaker 1>let's just be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a viable like Tulsi.</v>

1137
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.030
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tulsa Gabbert,</v>

1138
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.983
<v Speaker 1>great candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had Tulsi Gabbert and she was </v>

1139
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 1>running for president and she's also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and she's also left wing,</v>

1140
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.360
<v Speaker 1>but she cares about the issues.</v>

1141
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.180
<v Speaker 1>She cares about the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's Ernest.</v>

1142
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you talked to her,</v>

1143
00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:20.414
<v Speaker 1>you can tell she just isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's careful with her words </v>

1144
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>because she's intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because she's deceptive.</v>

1145
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would vote for her in a fucking </v>

1146
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1147
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.240
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just messaging each other.</v>

1148
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.580
<v Speaker 1>She was messaging me about my netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>special and I said,</v>

1149
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:37.220
<v Speaker 1>run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to run for president.</v>

1150
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be wonderful.</v>

1151
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm slightly fucking wind man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she can,</v>

1152
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.893
<v Speaker 1>but I think she could win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm slightly butthurt about Tulsi </v>

1153
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.830
<v Speaker 1>because when I was on your podcast last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1154
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I plugged her in talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome she is.</v>

1155
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:49.484
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm the one who originally </v>

1156
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 1>showed you who she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1157
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you know before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in that podcast many people.</v>

1158
00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So you had heard about.</v>

1159
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she comes on the show are definitely one</v>

1160
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:00.200
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She comes on the show and talks about.</v>

1161
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new media is a awesome and there's a lot</v>

1162
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 1>of great people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1163
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:04.933
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Dore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a pause and then you </v>

1164
00:53:06.831 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 1>move onto the next topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1165
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tulsi,</v>

1166
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I've plugged you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plug me Bro.</v>

1167
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:12.803
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm being incredibly petty and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even really mean what I'm saying </v>

1168
00:53:15.591 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 1>because I would still support her as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanitation 100 percent.</v>

1169
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.003
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some salt and it's headed your </v>

1170
00:53:21.171 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 1>way to also show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember now?</v>

1171
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:24.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's great.</v>

1172
00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:26.750
<v Speaker 1>She's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issues and um,</v>

1173
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a genuine person.</v>

1174
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I got out of her,</v>

1175
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 1>like what I got from talking to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a genuine person and man,</v>

1176
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it's because she's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii and it's just a different place.</v>

1177
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.203
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a state that's a small </v>

1178
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:42.750
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>

1179
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii is very small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a million people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Honolulu,</v>

1181
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.993
<v Speaker 1>but you get outside of Honolulu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a hundred thousand on the </v>

1182
00:53:50.011 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 1>big island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many Maui has,</v>

1183
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:54.240
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's only got a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand.</v>

1184
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to Hawaii before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it fucking great.</v>

1185
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the best is alumni.</v>

1186
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go somewhere and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>chill ax,</v>

1187
00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:04.043
<v Speaker 1>there's a four seasons and Lanai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire island has 3000 people </v>

1188
00:54:08.431 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1189
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get real island.</v>

1190
00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1191
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:18.150
<v Speaker 1>They're not like if you go to Maui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wonderful people.</v>

1192
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 1>They're great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've been groomed.</v>

1193
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have taught them how to talk like</v>

1194
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:24.774
<v Speaker 1>regular white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in my alumni they're just </v>

1195
00:54:28.321 --> 00:54:30.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking chilled out man.</v>

1196
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have that way of talking,</v>

1197
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk and you know.</v>

1198
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 1>But pigeon is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real interesting sort of A.</v>

1199
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's like a dialect of English </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would call it,</v>

1200
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 1>but they have really cool expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of the,</v>

1201
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.580
<v Speaker 1>they say a lot of things it will choke </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1202
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.443
<v Speaker 1>like if you talk about like what guy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining to me how many deer there </v>

1203
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:55.560
<v Speaker 1>were in this one place it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1204
00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:58.290
<v Speaker 1>it was a choke dear there was choked </v>
<v Speaker 1>dear.</v>

1205
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda like a broken English with</v>
<v Speaker 1>different words sprinkled.</v>

1206
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:02.423
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use different words for different </v>

1207
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:04.884
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be around them all the </v>

1208
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also like a,</v>

1209
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:10.770
<v Speaker 1>just a way of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1210
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.390
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like,</v>

1211
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called pad wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's called.</v>

1212
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a people who are Jamaican </v>
<v Speaker 1>who speak in English,</v>

1213
00:55:18.241 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's very broken English and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably real similar.</v>

1214
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And they love to say bumble clot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1216
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Blood clot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think mccullough.</v>

1217
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1218
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Blood clot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they also say blood clot.</v>

1219
00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.820
<v Speaker 1>They say blood clot a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

1220
00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should come up very rarely.</v>

1221
00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a doctor,</v>

1222
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's a way of saying stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1223
00:55:40.501 --> 00:55:42.540
<v Speaker 1>something's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means motherfucker.</v>

1224
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh mother bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what bumper caught means.</v>

1225
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The widest God is everyone in this room.</v>

1226
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess the technical needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood clot,</v>

1227
00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:51.853
<v Speaker 1>blood clot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a medical term basically talking </v>

1228
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:56.360
<v Speaker 1>about sutures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:55:56.361 --> 00:55:57.300
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1230
00:55:57.301 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 1>but that flight to Hawaii must be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>

1231
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's five hours from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's five.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fly there.</v>

1234
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.463
<v Speaker 1>Interject again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Top definition on urban dictionary says </v>

1235
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:12.840

<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

<v Speaker 3>him and we spoke about the issues,</v>

1258
00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I would agree with him on most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions,</v>

1259
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.574
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if he really believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in means it because he's a </v>

1260
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:18.574
<v Speaker 3>politician.</v>

1261
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:20.323
<v Speaker 3>Politician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1262
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.540
<v Speaker 3>There are politicians who I talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I know that they mean it.</v>

1263
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Tulsi Gabbard will be one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rocana would be another one of those.</v>

1264
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 3>We spoke about him on the show as time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was here.</v>

1265
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:28.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously Bernie Sanders is another one </v>

1266
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 3>of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1267
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:33.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a really interesting politician </v>
<v Speaker 3>and coming out of West Virginia.</v>

1268
00:57:33.731 --> 00:57:34.564
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you heard about this </v>

1269
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.584
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is Richard Odetta and he's </v>

1270
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 3>running against a Republican named Carol</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miller.</v>

1271
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.473
<v Speaker 3>Get this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's running in West Virginia is super </v>

1272
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:45.280
<v Speaker 3>deep red,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like big time Republican.</v>

1273
00:57:45.281 --> 00:57:46.114
<v Speaker 3>Almost the most republican tide probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Mississippi is the most </v>

1274
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 3>conservative area in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this district,</v>

1275
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:52.743
<v Speaker 3>trump won by 49 points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this Democrat Richard Odetta </v>

1276
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.273
<v Speaker 3>running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's up in a poll against a Republican </v>

1277
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.020
<v Speaker 3>by five points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1278
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So you're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell in a,</v>

1279
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a district like that.</v>

1280
00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Can a Democrat be leading?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is very simple.</v>

1281
00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:08.973
<v Speaker 3>He's populist and he's fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>working people and he's run these </v>

1282
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.154
<v Speaker 3>amazing ads where he literally gave out </v>
<v Speaker 3>his phone number and one of the eds and </v>

1283
00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:15.821
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1284
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're a constituent of mine and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an issue,</v>

1285
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:18.603
<v Speaker 3>call me and I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a lobbyist tries to come into my </v>

1286
00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:21.940
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kick him out.</v>

1287
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you in my office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about lobbyists,</v>

1288
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.473
<v Speaker 3>I care about the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's running on all substantive </v>

1289
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:29.140
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's taking no corporate PAC money.</v>

1290
00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:31.690
<v Speaker 3>He's for Medicare for all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a guy who,</v>

1291
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:32.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1292
00:58:32.591 --> 00:58:36.190
<v Speaker 3>he's a veteran in Iraq and Afghanistan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's.</v>

1293
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did vote for trump,</v>

1294
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.730
<v Speaker 3>and now he's one of trump's harshest </v>
<v Speaker 3>critics.</v>

1295
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.620
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

1296
00:58:41.621 --> 00:58:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I thought trump was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially good for working people,</v>

1297
00:58:45.041 --> 00:58:47.260
<v Speaker 3>but it just turns out he wasn't good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>working people.</v>

1298
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.093
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump ran as an anti outsourcing </v>

1299
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:50.643
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was against Nafta and tpp and all </v>

1300
00:58:51.911 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In trump's first year as president,</v>

1301
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.410
<v Speaker 3>there were 93,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs that were outsourced.</v>

1302
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 3>That's even worse than Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama had 87,000</v>

1303
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:01.330
<v Speaker 3>jobs outsourced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you go through his record with a</v>

1304
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:02.164
<v Speaker 3>fine tooth comb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like the unemployment rate being </v>

1305
00:59:03.071 --> 00:59:03.904
<v Speaker 3>low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's totally misleading because wages </v>

1306
00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:06.004
<v Speaker 3>are falling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if wages are falling and you can't </v>

1307
00:59:07.811 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 3>just brag about your economy being </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful and his tax bill,</v>

1308
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 3>83 percent of the benefits of the tax </v>
<v Speaker 3>bill went to the top one percent.</v>

1309
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Would you say the wages are falling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much they followed by A.</v>

1310
00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.880
<v Speaker 3>They're not keeping up with the pace of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation.</v>

1311
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 3>So it's probably about one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1312
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 1>the point is trump ran as a populist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately he was a fake populous.</v>

1313
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 1>And he's not really helping to work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

1314
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why his tax bill was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1315
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.330
<v Speaker 1>he gutted the estate tax for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not something that doesn't.</v>

1316
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>That affects point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1317
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:36.950
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Richard,</v>

1318
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:37.784
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jetta is this guy who voted for trump </v>

1319
00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:40.011
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1320
00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 1>I regretted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think trump is wrong.</v>

1321
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:42.914
<v Speaker 1>And basically what he's saying is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real populist candidate and he's a </v>

1322
00:59:46.251 --> 00:59:47.084
<v Speaker 1>really inspiring candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of amazing to see a plus 49 </v>

1323
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Republican district now potentially go </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic.</v>

1324
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.370
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's living proof of the point that I've</v>

1325
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:55.213
<v Speaker 1>been making since day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have Democrats who are running </v>

1326
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and they actually care about the issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a flight for working people.</v>

1327
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>That's how you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1328
01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.003
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is these labels in the </v>

1329
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 1>first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1330
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Like Republican versus Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1331
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we only have two different</v>

1332
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>distinct parties that are viable options</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2018,</v>

1333
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>just so fucking stupid to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>VR system.</v>

1334
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't like our system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1335
01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I like parliamentary systems better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish we had the.</v>

1336
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>When you said that the wages don't keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with inflation and so they're down by</v>

1337
01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:27.254
<v Speaker 1>about one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how much is unemployment up on </v>

1338
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>employment is down to three point odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and that is good.</v>

1339
01:00:33.471 --> 01:00:34.304
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just have to remember that </v>

1340
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very good economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicator because think about it.</v>

1341
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:41.414
<v Speaker 1>This is an argument that was presented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember back when I was in college </v>

1342
01:00:42.831 --> 01:00:43.664
<v Speaker 1>and a professor was challenging also on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this notion about unemployment and he </v>

1343
01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:46.454
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do know we can create an economy </v>

1344
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>that has zero percent unemployment.</v>

1345
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of us in the flashlight.</v>

1346
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know that.</v>

1347
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

1348
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

1349
01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.453
<v Speaker 1>everybody can be working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean everybody's being </v>

1350
01:00:59.841 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>paid or being paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So when to use unemployment as like your</v>
<v Speaker 1>top economic indicator,</v>

1352
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.313
<v Speaker 1>it's just a shitty indicator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the best thing you can </v>

1353
01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:08.804
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1354
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:09.723
<v Speaker 1>Because even if people were working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean they're doing what they </v>

1355
01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:12.014
<v Speaker 1>want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're being paid a fair </v>

1356
01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:13.491
<v Speaker 1>wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1357
01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Half of workers in America make $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year or less is true.</v>

1358
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Jamie wants to fact check me on that,</v>

1359
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm more than happy to be fact checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dark.</v>

1360
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Half of workers in America makes $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year or less now,</v>

1361
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:32.411
<v Speaker 1>but what about trump's always citing </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment rates for African Americans</v>

1362
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>or minorities that are lower than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've ever been before?</v>

1363
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.843
<v Speaker 1>That could be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think causes something </v>

1364
01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:40.814
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that's a trend that </v>

1365
01:01:42.441 --> 01:01:43.274
<v Speaker 1>was established during the Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration that's slowly but surely </v>

1366
01:01:45.981 --> 01:01:46.814
<v Speaker 1>moving into the position it's in now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just caught that wave or is it </v>

1367
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.840
<v Speaker 1>directly a result of the decisions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's made while he's in office?</v>

1368
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:54.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does have a lot to do with his tax </v>

1369
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.044
<v Speaker 1>bill because corporations are getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of money in corporate </v>

1370
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>profits are through the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're hiring.</v>

1371
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the link to that.</v>

1372
01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:04.994
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come full circle back to the wages </v>

1373
01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:06.974
<v Speaker 1>conversation and remember this is all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's temporary because look at what's </v>

1374
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>happening to the deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1375
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.090
<v Speaker 1>now I'm not a like a deficit hawk where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's such a gigantic issue,</v>

1376
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>but the Republicans typically run as </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficit hawks</v>

1377
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:21.263
<v Speaker 3>and when you look at the deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gone up by 51 percent of all </v>

1378
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 3>American workers make less than $30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year.</v>

1379
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 3>A lot of similar numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all right around that wire.</v>

1380
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.613
<v Speaker 3>So the deficit is skyrocketing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something that's going to </v>

1381
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.280
<v Speaker 3>temporarily help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1382
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:38.310
<v Speaker 3>those numbers that you were citing </v>
<v Speaker 3>before those,</v>

1383
01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 3>during the Obama administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that article?</v>

1384
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 3>That's still the case?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two Thousand 15?</v>

1385
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:44.603
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it is.</v>

1386
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm finding all sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one's serious says that half of </v>

1387
01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.850
<v Speaker 3>jobs in America pay less than $18 an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

1388
01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:51.684
<v Speaker 3>Can trump help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is from August of last year since </v>

1389
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 3>it's fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right around.</v>

1390
01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 3>How's the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe?</v>

1391
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A car.</v>

1392
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.893
<v Speaker 3>It is a house car?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.960
<v Speaker 3>What was trump supposed to do and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>did he not do?</v>

1394
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.823
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was he claiming to do before he </v>

1395
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:03.630
<v Speaker 3>went into office?</v>

1396
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:07.200
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said everything at the same time.</v>

1397
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:08.063
<v Speaker 3>So I could give any answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>question because I'm curious to just </v>

1398
01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:12.084
<v Speaker 3>pick on trump because I was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>loudest screaming about how Hillary </v>

1399
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.983
<v Speaker 3>Clinton was the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a politician who throughout her </v>

1400
01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 3>career she was on every side of every </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue and trump,</v>

1401
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is trump actually got away</v>

1402
01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:29.580
<v Speaker 3>with it because I think the way he acts </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a politician,</v>

1403
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:30.773
<v Speaker 3>he acts like he has no filter and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a straight shooter sitting next to </v>

1404
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:34.284
<v Speaker 3>you at the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is like Rand Paul </v>

1405
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:37.920
<v Speaker 3>pointed out in the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1406
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump is a straight shooter </v>
<v Speaker 3>without the truth.</v>

1407
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Like he's like pretending to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight shooter.</v>

1408
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 3>So it depends on what issue you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking you about.</v>

1409
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:46.734
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to give me the specific </v>

1410
01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:48.714
<v Speaker 3>issue you want to know.</v>

1411
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.613
<v Speaker 3>Like foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't talk about that for a little </v>

1412
01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:51.120
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1413
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.680
<v Speaker 3>So on foreign policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1414
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:56.850
<v Speaker 3>half the time Donald Trump said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so many tweets of him saying</v>

1415
01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 3>this before he was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before he ran that we need to get out of</v>

1416
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always the time.</v>

1417
01:04:01.981 --> 01:04:03.360
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we the,</v>

1418
01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 3>we need to rebuild our own country and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1419
01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:07.230
<v Speaker 3>those are tweets where I read that and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1420
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump 100 percent.</v>

1421
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:12.480
<v Speaker 3>But then the other half the time when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on the campaign trail,</v>

1422
01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 3>he spoke about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1423
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to bomb isis to smithereens and </v>

1424
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:17.604
<v Speaker 3>we need to wipe them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those things are kind of </v>

1425
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:20.574
<v Speaker 3>contradictory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either you bring your troops home and </v>

1426
01:04:22.051 --> 01:04:22.884
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1427
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:25.620
<v Speaker 3>didn't think he would be able to fix </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything really quickly.</v>

1428
01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that one of his premises?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Typical trump bloviating like,</v>

1429
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be amazing.</v>

1430
01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:32.670
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be the best job you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen over.</v>

1431
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad impression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to change the tone.</v>

1432
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.913
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because I'm not doing the full </v>

1433
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:40.140
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing good movement.</v>

1434
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 3>The movement skill I have is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

1435
01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call you Joseph.</v>

1436
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.970
<v Speaker 3>What did you think personally when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw Kanye with that?</v>

1437
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:50.023
<v Speaker 3>Insane?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to ask you about that to </v>

1438
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 3>bipolar rant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel kind of bad for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do and I'm not and I want to be clear.</v>

1440
01:04:56.791 --> 01:05:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm really not saying that as a partisan</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing because even if Bernie Sanders was</v>

1441
01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:03.120
<v Speaker 3>president and Kanye West was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>office saying the exact same stuff,</v>

1442
01:05:03.121 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 3>I'd still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1443
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 3>what is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you burn him up the same way too?</v>

1445
01:05:08.101 --> 01:05:13.101
<v Speaker 3>Because I remember when he left those </v>
<v Speaker 3>black lives matter chick that cost him,</v>

1446
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.320
<v Speaker 3>but just stepped aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really did cost him.</v>

1447
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.320
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1448
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People</v>

1449
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.903
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do.</v>

1450
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>You can't just take the microphone away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from someone you know.</v>

1451
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>So here's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this helped Donald Trump at</v>

1452
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>all with black voters having cognac do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1453
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but how much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good number really?</v>

1454
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.050
<v Speaker 1>You think so too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1455
01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1456
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I feel like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

1457
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.013
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West has been disinvited from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of cookouts now as a result of what </v>

1458
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>he did with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's on black twitter.</v>

1459
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Jamie says not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I read,</v>

1460
01:05:43.641 --> 01:05:48.641
<v Speaker 1>it did not in black twitter response has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been very negative,</v>

1461
01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>so it was Kinda is really almost in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1462
01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>blowing his own reputation on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1463
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>

1464
01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:57.403
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone who's a fan of Kanye </v>

1465
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who seen him blow up on Jimmy Kimmel and</v>

1466
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:05.770
<v Speaker 1>blow up on all these different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have criticized him.</v>

1467
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously got mental health issues.</v>

1468
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.880
<v Speaker 1>When he went on that rant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in San Jose.</v>

1469
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that a concert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said I didn't vote,</v>

1470
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>but if I did vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was voted on trump and everybody went</v>

1471
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:22.480
<v Speaker 1>and then he wound up going into a mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital after that.</v>

1472
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Checked into a mental hospital and then </v>

1473
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>canceled his tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

1474
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.633
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was because he couldn't handle the </v>

1475
01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:29.674
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it and also part of it </v>

1476
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>he's legitimately mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1477
01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:36.034
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't marry that lady and be a part </v>

1478
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:39.160
<v Speaker 1>of that family because he's thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>

1479
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>He's got some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with them.</v>

1480
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a genius in terms of music.</v>

1481
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1482
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.210
<v Speaker 1>he's fantastic at creating beats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs and hooks.</v>

1483
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>He knows what the fuck he's doing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1484
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:55.420
<v Speaker 1>he's got a problem and you hear it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he rants,</v>

1485
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 1>when he's ranting and when he's talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Ford making dope cars.</v>

1486
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 1>We don't use the word dope because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>only use words like magnificent,</v>

1487
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive words like he's,</v>

1488
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:05.613
<v Speaker 1>he's making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's listening to himself and jerking </v>

1489
01:07:08.711 --> 01:07:11.200
<v Speaker 1>off to the noises that are coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own mouth.</v>

1490
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:12.123
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved when you said to the reporter </v>

1491
01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 1>when the report or pushed back and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

1492
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just asked me a question.</v>

1493
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.553
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that because is like </v>

1494
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:20.620
<v Speaker 1>tasting a fine wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complex.</v>

1495
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1496
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My read on him,</v>

1497
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:26.103
<v Speaker 1>he's he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of what he's doing is that </v>

1498
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.713
<v Speaker 1>he's a contrarian and when you are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place like Hollywood and you're there </v>

1499
01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:33.034
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always surrounded by people who </v>

1500
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:34.924
<v Speaker 1>are anti trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something about just </v>

1501
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:39.480
<v Speaker 1>this knee jerk reactionary feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1502
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.391
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1503
01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not with you guys.</v>

1504
01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm different and I'm special as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of being different,</v>

1505
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a contrarian and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with you.</v>

1506
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:47.703
<v Speaker 1>And then I also think there's narcissism</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that he looks at trump and </v>

1507
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:55.120
<v Speaker 1>he really sees himself in trump and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody laughed at trump when he said,</v>

1508
01:07:55.121 --> 01:07:57.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win.</v>

1509
01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you remember a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West said,</v>

1510
01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:00.094
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was laughing at it wasn't </v>

1511
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>even a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was recently.</v>

1512
01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

1513
01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:05.524
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's on guys named Piers </v>

1514
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1515
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right into it on twitter.</v>

1516
01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Who said you're talking to your future </v>
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>

1517
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what Kanye said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1518
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it was Harvey Levin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it to you're talking to a future</v>

1519
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>president actually disliked piers Morgan</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than I dislike Kanye West.</v>

1520
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Kanye on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Connie's ill.</v>

1521
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:29.263
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

1522
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And I know he's been medicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he was all Chubby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he's on his medication,</v>

1524
01:08:35.091 --> 01:08:35.924
<v Speaker 1>you got fat and apparently he got off </v>
<v Speaker 1>his medication and there are a lot of </v>

1525
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:38.601
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1526
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:39.434
<v Speaker 1>who would hear the point you made and b </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be really angry at the fact that </v>

1527
01:08:42.921 --> 01:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>you think that he's mentally ill even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though I think that's.</v>

1528
01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it all my twitter,</v>

1529
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it on my twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People saying,</v>

1530
01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a cheap partisan hacky point.</v>

1531
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.593
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because he's admitted Lee </v>

1532
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.553
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did say that and the thing he </v>

1533
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was diagnosed bipolar.</v>

1534
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Institutionalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.273
<v Speaker 1>He spent time in a mental hospital for </v>
<v Speaker 1>being mentally ill and when you listen </v>

1536
01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:06.890
<v Speaker 1>to him brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just my opinion.</v>

1537
01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.113
<v Speaker 1>That is not the ravings of someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully considering the implications </v>

1538
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.510
<v Speaker 1>of each word they're saying and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to express themselves in a way</v>

1539
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:21.200
<v Speaker 1>that's going to portray some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

1540
01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 1>cohesive message is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not what he's doing.</v>

1541
01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:28.040
<v Speaker 1>What he's doing is jerking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just jerking off with his mouth.</v>

1542
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1543
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get it out.</v>

1544
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Is the fine wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1545
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.790
<v Speaker 1>we gotta we gotta make the dopest cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't fly back the dopest cause,</v>

1546
01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:37.643
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear what he said in that same </v>

1547
01:09:38.601 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1548
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.453
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we got to help Larry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoover is because in a different </v>

1549
01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:45.560
<v Speaker 1>universe there are alternate universes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am him.</v>

1550
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lyrics,</v>

1551
01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:50.883
<v Speaker 1>song lyrics to a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it something he says that when he's </v>

1552
01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>off his Lexapro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't seen nothing crazier than this</v>

1554
01:09:56.211 --> 01:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he off his Lexapro.</v>

1555
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Remember that time in Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the law that last time,</v>

1556
01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:08.900
<v Speaker 1>the episode asking me why the hell are </v>
<v Speaker 1>texting code four times just to say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't text me,</v>

1559
01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we Finna lose all self control,</v>

1560
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:18.320
<v Speaker 1>but you ain't Finna raising your voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>at me.</v>

1561
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Especially when we end the Giuseppe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern day socrates,</v>

1562
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>various man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's silly,</v>

1563
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.033
<v Speaker 1>but I love that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nothing crazier than when he's off </v>

1564
01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:33.320
<v Speaker 1>his lexapro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1565
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:34.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do kind of feel bad even though this </v>

1566
01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:36.670
<v Speaker 1>is such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>like a side show type thing because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>

1568
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:39.893
<v Speaker 1>I mean the state of the country so weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>that beach simply because of his </v>

1569
01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:43.754
<v Speaker 1>celebrity and the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media doesn't know how to </v>

1570
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 1>keep their eye on the ball.</v>

1571
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>You never know who can become president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be somebody like Kanye.</v>

1572
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You're underestimating trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not The guy who said he could win,</v>

1573
01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:57.350
<v Speaker 1>but you knew you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did too.</v>

1574
01:10:57.351 --> 01:10:58.184
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set it on my last Netflix special and </v>

1575
01:11:00.101 --> 01:11:00.934
<v Speaker 1>one before my last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Kanye West has a goddamn </v>

1576
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:06.440
<v Speaker 1>snowball's chance in hell of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1577
01:11:06.441 --> 01:11:07.274
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody that's famous can </v>

1578
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.364
<v Speaker 1>be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what trump did was map some </v>

1579
01:11:12.111 --> 01:11:17.111
<v Speaker 1>master manipulating skills combined with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some super human energy that most likely</v>

1580
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>came from diet pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think is his ability to campaign,</v>

1581
01:11:22.141 --> 01:11:22.974
<v Speaker 1>his ability to maintain his energy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep ranting and raving and fucking </v>

1582
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.550
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1583
01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Hillary couldn't keep up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1584
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:30.983
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she literally didn't campaign places </v>

1585
01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>because she didn't have the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was breaking down.</v>

1586
01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:35.603
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he trump went directly to the rust belt </v>

1587
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.293
<v Speaker 1>and railed against Nafta and the trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>deals that destroyed their lives and </v>

1588
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>

1589
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bill Clinton is the one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to.</v>

1590
01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:47.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't campaign and a lot of </v>

1591
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>those states because her campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely thought like,</v>

1592
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:51.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got those.</v>

1593
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Those are democratic lockups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then guess what?</v>

1594
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Trump ended up winning because of 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>votes in the rust belt.</v>

1595
01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.030
<v Speaker 1>So it directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of that.</v>

1596
01:12:00.031 --> 01:12:00.864
<v Speaker 1>That's why I get so angry when there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people on the left who like only </v>

1597
01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:04.614
<v Speaker 1>focus on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of trump's supporters who are </v>

1598
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:10.410
<v Speaker 1>racist and all they want to do is talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how bad of people they are.</v>

1599
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:11.161
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1600
01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 1>you could shame people all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to get them to vote for</v>

1601
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I agree you don't.</v>

1602
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:18.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the David Duke's to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

1603
01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:19.434
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know who you do need the two </v>

1604
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:22.560
<v Speaker 1>times Obama voter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who then flipped to trump who was in the</v>

1605
01:12:22.561 --> 01:12:24.420
<v Speaker 1>rust belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had his fricking job outsourced.</v>

1606
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That's who you need and that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats abandoned the.</v>

1607
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:32.100
<v Speaker 1>The problem with saying that all trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>voters are racist too is you're.</v>

1608
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:37.130
<v Speaker 1>You're creating these very clear sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a way to whitewash or loss.</v>

1609
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a way to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1610
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.353
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to change in any way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just because these people </v>

1611
01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.390
<v Speaker 1>are bad people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't blame us.</v>

1612
01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:47.550
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing we did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blame then.</v>

1613
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.593
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you really were interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning and getting power and </v>

1614
01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 1>implementing your agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to.</v>

1615
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 1>If you want to reach whoever you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach.</v>

1616
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:55.794
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you tried to get David </v>

1617
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Duke or Richard Spencer on your side </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people are too far gone,</v>

1618
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.180
<v Speaker 1>but 70 percent of the country is not too</v>
<v Speaker 1>far gone.</v>

1619
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should have went to the rust belt</v>

1620
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:06.143
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to get the two times Obama voter </v>

1621
01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:09.270
<v Speaker 1>who then flipped to trump and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do that.</v>

1622
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also,</v>

1623
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.920
<v Speaker 1>there was some real benefit in someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Bernie Sanders,</v>

1624
01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:14.754
<v Speaker 1>just like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some real benefit in someone </v>

1625
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:16.854
<v Speaker 1>like Obama socially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you saw a guy who was came </v>

1626
01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:22.704
<v Speaker 1>from a single mom who was a black guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who winds up being the president of </v>

1627
01:13:25.681 --> 01:13:26.730
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go,</v>

1628
01:13:26.731 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're better than.</v>

1629
01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

1630
01:13:29.311 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe we don't have all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudices.</v>

1631
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's less of us than people try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to claim.</v>

1632
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think a guy like Bernie Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been a real full oil.</v>

1633
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:40.833
<v Speaker 1>It could have been a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have been a guy that if you </v>

1634
01:13:44.941 --> 01:13:45.774
<v Speaker 1>looked at what trump stood for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump stood for the outsider who </v>

1635
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>understands the game because he hired </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people,</v>

1636
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 1>he paid those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bribed those people,</v>

1637
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.860
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm going to clean up the swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1638
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>drain the swamp.</v>

1639
01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And on the other side you've got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply flawed woman who's deleted 30,000</v>

1640
01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 1>emails who's beholden to all the Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

1641
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 1>the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how about the Patriot Act?</v>

1642
01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Warren was spying on all Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she supported every time there was</v>

1643
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>a major issue where it was really a test</v>
<v Speaker 1>of character and ideology was wrong.</v>

1644
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you go into her,</v>

1645
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>her thoughts on gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't believe in gay marriage.</v>

1646
01:14:21.311 --> 01:14:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1647
01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:24.003
<v Speaker 1>Which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the least progressive </v>

1648
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:29.620
<v Speaker 1>things you could ever say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you didn't believe it until 2013.</v>

1649
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1650
01:14:30.481 --> 01:14:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Why not like you think it should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a man and a woman.</v>

1651
01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you're trying to pander to what</v>

1652
01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 1>you think is the majority sentiment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious country.</v>

1653
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going.</v>

1654
01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1655
01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is the fundamentally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of Hillary Clinton.</v>

1656
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Didn't agree or disagree with him for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past 30,</v>

1657
01:14:46.871 --> 01:14:47.704
<v Speaker 1>40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had the same ideology saying the </v>

1658
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:50.380
<v Speaker 1>same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1659
01:14:50.381 --> 01:14:51.214
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very progressive and maybe he's totally </v>

1660
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 1>wrong about some of his socialist ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would bankrupt the country.</v>

1661
01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would.</v>

1662
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would.</v>

1663
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be catastrophic to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy to have this guy.</v>

1664
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:07.973
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be the opposite of what </v>

1665
01:15:10.451 --> 01:15:11.284
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with right now with in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the progression of </v>

1666
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.273
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where unemployment is at an all time </v>

1667
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:22.351
<v Speaker 1>high and that or all time low rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where when you're looking at people that</v>

1668
01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:24.184
<v Speaker 1>are doing well in this country because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of some of the things that trump's </v>

1669
01:15:26.381 --> 01:15:27.214
<v Speaker 1>implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's people that are getting </v>

1670
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:33.520
<v Speaker 1>lower wage jobs than they would like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have or whatever it is.</v>

1671
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.353
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe those numbers would go in the </v>

1672
01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1673
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 1>but my point is what he represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>though is someone who's not corrupt.</v>

1674
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:44.620
<v Speaker 1>What he represents as someone who's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>beholden to banks,</v>

1675
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 1>but he represents someone who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about money.</v>

1676
01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:48.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not as thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never been his thing.</v>

1677
01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.540
<v Speaker 1>His thing has been social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's right or wrong,</v>

1678
01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:56.050
<v Speaker 1>at least it would represent something </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely different.</v>

1679
01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with Clinton represented was </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption with a different taste to it.</v>

1680
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with a lot of what you just said</v>

1681
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:06.500
<v Speaker 1>there in terms of Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1682
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.573
<v Speaker 1>I personally wouldn't use the term </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice for him because that has </v>

1683
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing on the internet and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know everybody.</v>

1685
01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.393
<v Speaker 1>It's basically what I think of when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear Social Justice Warrior is over </v>

1686
01:16:19.201 --> 01:16:20.034
<v Speaker 1>sensitive college kid with pink hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to diy platform </v>

1687
01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 1>conservative speakers now.</v>

1688
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:24.783
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's unfortunate that it's become </v>

1689
01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:26.620
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1690
01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1691
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.230
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the way social justice,</v>

1692
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>let's say progressive ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1693
01:16:32.471 --> 01:16:33.304
<v Speaker 1>Say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what Bernie Sanders actually </v>

1694
01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 1>represents in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and based on his record,</v>

1695
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.134
<v Speaker 1>is what he wants to do is make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country like every other developed </v>

1696
01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:42.994
<v Speaker 1>country on the planet that's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking our ass in so many relevant </v>

1697
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this common argument,</v>

1698
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.104
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing but a straw man </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that comes from the far right </v>

1699
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:54.520
<v Speaker 1>where they say Bernie Sanders and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

1700
01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:58.450
<v Speaker 1>he wants to make the United States like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela or like Cuba or sometimes even</v>

1701
01:16:58.451 --> 01:17:00.460
<v Speaker 1>say like the old Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1702
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.353
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually go issue for issue </v>

1703
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:03.933
<v Speaker 1>pretty clearly what he's asking for is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish or Norwegian type system which </v>

1704
01:17:07.871 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>is similar to the u,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the major difference is they have</v>

1705
01:17:11.781 --> 01:17:12.614
<v Speaker 1>universal healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these places have universal </v>

1706
01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:14.924
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1707
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:15.913
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1708
01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class wages are higher.</v>

1709
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 1>So what he's asking for is a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed economy.</v>

1710
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It's called social democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's asking for a social democratic type</v>

1711
01:17:24.441 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not post capitalist.</v>

1712
01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying let's totally scrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system and let's all,</v>

1713
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:30.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act like wear whatever Hugo Chavez or </v>

1714
01:17:32.091 --> 01:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Che Guevara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's,</v>

1715
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:34.183
<v Speaker 1>what he's asking for is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call it moderate in an </v>

1716
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:37.514
<v Speaker 1>international sense because he looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the developed world and he </v>

1717
01:17:39.591 --> 01:17:40.520
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1718
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:44.110
<v Speaker 1>these guys are kicking our ass on </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare education their ass and what,</v>

1719
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 1>what parts of the developed world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1720
01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:47.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at healthcare for example,</v>

1721
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.823
<v Speaker 1>there's a study that came out from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Commonwealth Fund which found that the </v>

1722
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.513
<v Speaker 1>United States ranks 11th out of 11 when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to developed countries in </v>

1723
01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.653
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have worse health outcomes and </v>

1724
01:17:57.741 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it's more expensive and we don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover everybody.</v>

1725
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:02.180
<v Speaker 1>We have 29 million people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninsured.</v>

1726
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are single payer systems and their</v>

1727
01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:10.091
<v Speaker 1>systems beat us in every measurable </v>
<v Speaker 1>health outcomes based on what you have.</v>

1728
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:12.913
<v Speaker 1>Someone who goes to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse outcome in terms of what happens </v>

1729
01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:17.894
<v Speaker 1>once you've been checked in or you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to look at the methodology of the </v>

1730
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:21.224
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that off the </v>

1731
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:22.394
<v Speaker 1>top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big issue is because we have a </v>

1732
01:18:23.781 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 1>giant problem obviously with our diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1733
01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:27.170
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure I'm not.</v>

1734
01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't deny that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much have.</v>

1735
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of it is based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1736
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.290
<v Speaker 1>When you're dealing with worse health </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes,</v>

1737
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:34.124
<v Speaker 1>like how much of that health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of those health problems are </v>

1738
01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:38.563
<v Speaker 1>based on people's personal choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than the healthcare system that </v>

1739
01:18:41.691 --> 01:18:42.470
<v Speaker 1>they're operating under.</v>

1740
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:43.303
<v Speaker 1>So that is definitely a serious problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one that needs conversation and </v>

1741
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:47.174
<v Speaker 1>needs fixing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm referring to is stuff that's </v>

1742
01:18:48.711 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 1>more like we have 29 million people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are uninsured in this country.</v>

1743
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:53.683
<v Speaker 1>We have anywhere from 32 to 45,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that die every year in this </v>

1744
01:18:56.151 --> 01:18:58.160
<v Speaker 1>country because they don't have access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to basic healthcare.</v>

1745
01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.113
<v Speaker 1>We pay a per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pay double what other developed </v>

1746
01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 1>countries pay and again they cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

1747
01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 1>We don't cover everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very.</v>

1748
01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:08.043
<v Speaker 1>We're failing in every measurable way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you control for factors like </v>

1749
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:13.170
<v Speaker 1>your accurately pointing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's going on too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of like,</v>

1751
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:20.480
<v Speaker 1>but we have a very high number of really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic doctors.</v>

1752
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1753
01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I know people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I'm gonna.</v>

1754
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Address that in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please go.</v>

1755
01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:24.561
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1756
01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:26.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Saudi prince,</v>

1757
01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:27.973
<v Speaker 1>you do want to come to the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>for healthcare because if you're in the </v>

1758
01:19:30.201 --> 01:19:31.460
<v Speaker 1>top point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh one percent,</v>

1759
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:32.960
<v Speaker 1>you are going to get the best care here.</v>

1760
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.053
<v Speaker 1>It's just a brain surgeon or just as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pediatric surgeon for the average </v>

1761
01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:38.324
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1762
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:39.523
<v Speaker 1>You're going to want to be in Canada or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden or Norway or Australia or any of </v>

1763
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:42.914
<v Speaker 1>those places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the argument for socialized </v>

1764
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:50.501
<v Speaker 1>medicine versus privatized medicine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>privatized medicine incentivizes someone</v>

1765
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>to excel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone to be that guy that,</v>

1766
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:56.450
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy worked on Lebron James.</v>

1767
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go see him.</v>

1768
01:19:57.681 --> 01:19:59.390
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best.</v>

1769
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a decent point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my counter to that is,</v>

1770
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:03.014
<v Speaker 1>and I know Bernie Sanders is as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen his bill and he </v>

1771
01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 1>advocates for a particular type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all system.</v>

1772
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:13.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to ban supplemental </v>
<v Speaker 1>private insurance.</v>

1773
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.033
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would totally disagree with any bill </v>

1774
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.093
<v Speaker 1>that says we're now banning private </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance because you can do a single </v>

1775
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:21.084
<v Speaker 1>payer system where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have public funding of </v>

1776
01:20:23.521 --> 01:20:24.354
<v Speaker 1>public institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could do a single payer system </v>

1777
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.230
<v Speaker 1>like the French do or the Canadian do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were.</v>

1778
01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 1>The Canadians do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have public funding of private</v>

1779
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:35.790
<v Speaker 1>entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you're talking about is,</v>

1780
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:36.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1781
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no competition,</v>

1782
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to get the best doctors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things of that nature,</v>

1783
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.003
<v Speaker 1>and my reaction to that is I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the baseline public </v>

1784
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:45.894
<v Speaker 1>funding of private institutions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>still allow people if they want to pay </v>

1785
01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 1>extra and go to a specialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could do that.</v>

1786
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:51.293
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily even saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that the system of </v>

1787
01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 1>having an incentive for being excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1788
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Having a financial incentive that causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to excel.</v>

1789
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:04.463
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with that in certain </v>

1790
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:06.810
<v Speaker 1>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in other fields.</v>

1791
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's certainly exist in the </v>

1792
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:13.731
<v Speaker 1>medical field and in surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in many different medical practices.</v>

1793
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:15.563
<v Speaker 1>You find fantastic practitioners here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States because they get paid </v>

1794
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:19.590
<v Speaker 1>substantially for it.</v>

1795
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that the profit motive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically in the realm of health care</v>

1796
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.133
<v Speaker 1>has had the opposite effect and has made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it so that we have a disastrous system </v>

1797
01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.480
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we talk about.</v>

1798
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that as well,</v>

1799
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.023
<v Speaker 1>but I think that when you're saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kick her ass and all these other </v>

1800
01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.230
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you say,</v>

1801
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.333
<v Speaker 1>I have Canadian friends that come over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here to get operated on and I have and </v>

1802
01:21:41.221 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 1>they have American friends who go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada to get healthcare,</v>

1803
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:44.453
<v Speaker 1>but it's cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're not going to be </v>

1804
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:47.573
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going how they get </v>

1805
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Canada if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were to go to Canada and you </v>

1806
01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:52.734
<v Speaker 1>were to get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go to the hospital that they </v>

1807
01:21:53.401 --> 01:21:55.730
<v Speaker 1>don't charge you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're an American citizen,</v>

1808
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:56.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're a citizen.</v>

1809
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:59.040
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump was saying back,</v>

1810
01:21:59.041 --> 01:21:59.874
<v Speaker 1>he was on like David Letterman show </v>
<v Speaker 1>years before he became president and he </v>

1811
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:02.844
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how awesome the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scottish healthcare system is because </v>

1812
01:22:04.561 --> 01:22:08.130
<v Speaker 1>his buddy went over there and he broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>his arm when he was there and he went to</v>

1813
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.560
<v Speaker 1>a hospital in Scotland and on his way </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1814
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:11.760
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do I owe you?</v>

1815
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And they said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get Out.</v>

1816
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:19.380
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a guy in New Jersey and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly to Montreal because you're sick,</v>

1817
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:20.830
<v Speaker 1>they'll just take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1818
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a Canadian citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1819
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:24.463
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell people things just fucked up </v>

1820
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>because certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1821
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:32.670
<v Speaker 1>certain things in a civilized society </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be off the table.</v>

1822
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:34.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of what are those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1823
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not like everybody agrees with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of government.</v>

1824
01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody agrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1825
01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:39.980
<v Speaker 1>we should probably have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1826
01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:42.450
<v Speaker 1>paved roads and police like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>

1827
01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a matter of let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>prioritize here.</v>

1828
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:46.464
<v Speaker 1>What are the things that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take off the table and fun with our tax </v>

1829
01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:51.240
<v Speaker 1>money and every other developed country </v>
<v Speaker 1>has decided,</v>

1830
01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:52.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare is one of those things.</v>

1831
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's not be silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1832
01:22:53.431 --> 01:22:54.264
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about that many times in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast that socialism is </v>

1833
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:59.940
<v Speaker 1>absolutely apparent in many aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our society,</v>

1834
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.300
<v Speaker 1>especially firefighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>police officers.</v>

1835
01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:04.323
<v Speaker 1>I mean paying for the street is paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the roads like we all agree that our </v>

1836
01:23:07.061 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>money should be pooled to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these very specific issues,</v>

1837
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.213
<v Speaker 1>but then when it comes to some issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get angry and we pretend socialism </v>

1838
01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:16.990
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist at all in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1839
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:17.883
<v Speaker 1>I think medicine is one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my problem with that is that </v>

1840
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:21.904
<v Speaker 1>medicine is one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that a human being could ever </v>

1841
01:23:24.461 --> 01:23:29.461
<v Speaker 1>have the in and if you get healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare can allow you to stay alive.</v>

1842
01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if you don't stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't contribute to the society.</v>

1843
01:23:33.071 --> 01:23:33.561
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1844
01:23:33.561 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 1>you're dying from something that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could cure.</v>

1845
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:41.380
<v Speaker 1>If you had the money to cure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is a giant problem in society.</v>

1846
01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>If we don't address sick and ill people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and injured people,</v>

1847
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:46.810
<v Speaker 1>that's true because then we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>caring for each other.</v>

1848
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:47.703
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a medical bills is one of the top </v>

1849
01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:51.730
<v Speaker 1>causes of bankruptcy in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

1850
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.713
<v Speaker 1>Can only imagine medical bankruptcy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't exist in the rest of the </v>

1851
01:23:54.881 --> 01:23:56.650
<v Speaker 1>modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a thing here.</v>

1852
01:23:56.651 --> 01:23:57.484
<v Speaker 1>It's a gigantic thing and a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird what we've done and you know </v>

1853
01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:01.684
<v Speaker 1>another thing that's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what we've done with one of two </v>

1854
01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:06.520
<v Speaker 1>countries that allows pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug companies to advertise on the air,</v>

1855
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:09.520
<v Speaker 1>not just fucking insane congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

1856
01:24:09.521 --> 01:24:12.340
<v Speaker 1>this is why they have like a 15 or 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent approval rating.</v>

1857
01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 1>They've repeatedly slapped down </v>
<v Speaker 1>provisions that would give us cheaper,</v>

1858
01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:18.603
<v Speaker 1>but pharmaceutical drugs because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing the pharmaceutical drug </v>

1859
01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:21.940
<v Speaker 1>companies to price gouge us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1860
01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Because they're all bought by big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharma.</v>

1861
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1862
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1863
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 1>What lobbyists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting them out,</v>

1864
01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.410
<v Speaker 1>special interest groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting their influence out,</v>

1865
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:34.440
<v Speaker 1>getting that kind of money and influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of pocket there.</v>

1866
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:35.283
<v Speaker 1>There's a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty eighth amendment money out of </v>

1867
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:38.374
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do a system that's called </v>

1868
01:24:39.881 --> 01:24:40.714
<v Speaker 1>clean elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically public financing of </v>

1869
01:24:42.491 --> 01:24:43.324
<v Speaker 1>elections where instead of instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>running and only having a bigger </v>

1870
01:24:46.241 --> 01:24:48.310
<v Speaker 1>megaphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sell out more to billionaires,</v>

1871
01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:49.883
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run and you actually have a battle </v>

1872
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:54.520
<v Speaker 1>of ideas and competing philosophies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then whoever has the best ideas ends</v>

1873
01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:55.354
<v Speaker 1>up winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's pretend let's go devil's </v>

1874
01:24:56.501 --> 01:24:59.020
<v Speaker 1>advocate shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretend you're arguing against that.</v>

1875
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 1>What if you were some lobbyists for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drug company and you were</v>

1876
01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:04.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a.</v>

1877
01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1878
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you exactly what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

1879
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:11.860
<v Speaker 1>It's free speech is free speech to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>a $20,000</v>

1880
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:12.873
<v Speaker 1>and give it to the Super Pac that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get this politician elected </v>

1881
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 1>because you're telling me I can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1882
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.313
<v Speaker 1>Then you're telling me that which means </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying I don't have the free </v>

1883
01:25:19.091 --> 01:25:22.870
<v Speaker 1>speech to be able to say I support a </v>
<v Speaker 1>private pharmaceutical system.</v>

1884
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:25.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've literally argued that in court.</v>

1885
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1886
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:27.843
<v Speaker 1>and then the counterargument to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>at many other people have pointed this </v>

1887
01:25:30.101 --> 01:25:30.881
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the first,</v>

1888
01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:31.714
<v Speaker 1>but if money equals speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitution should be legal and murder </v>

1889
01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:36.544
<v Speaker 1>for hire should be legal because I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually hiring somebody to murder </v>

1890
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:40.024
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying with speech because </v>

1891
01:25:41.171 --> 01:25:43.240
<v Speaker 1>money is speech that I'm okay with </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitmen.</v>

1892
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1893
01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:48.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real issue as well would be that </v>

1894
01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies making no money.</v>

1895
01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 1>There's still massive amounts of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are on medication.</v>

1896
01:25:59.230 --> 01:26:00.063
<v Speaker 1>They would still make a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that just wouldn't make as much </v>

1897
01:26:04.161 --> 01:26:06.320
<v Speaker 1>money and how much money are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>making?</v>

1898
01:26:06.321 --> 01:26:07.154
<v Speaker 1>And that's where it gets obscene when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the actual numbers of </v>

1899
01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:09.914
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drug companies rake in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country in terms of what it </v>

1900
01:26:12.621 --> 01:26:15.140
<v Speaker 1>takes to develop a drug versus what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit margin is.</v>

1901
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hurdles to get a drug,</v>

1902
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.413
<v Speaker 1>any drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is an issue that they're </v>

1903
01:26:21.561 --> 01:26:22.394
<v Speaker 1>dealing with right now with stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And stem cells have the approval of </v>

1904
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:25.190
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1905
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're,</v>

1906
01:26:26.151 --> 01:26:28.580
<v Speaker 1>they're treating them like they are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

1907
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:29.743
<v Speaker 1>And the conspiracy theory is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drug companies do not </v>

1908
01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>want the approval of stem cells for </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

1909
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:39.261
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there,</v>

1910
01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:41.070
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1911
01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:42.243
<v Speaker 1>umbilical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different types of stem cells </v>

1912
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:48.910
<v Speaker 1>because the success rate is fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think that it could potentially</v>

1913
01:26:49.851 --> 01:26:53.300
<v Speaker 1>cut down a profit margins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certainly an incentive problem</v>

1914
01:26:53.301 --> 01:26:54.134
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just the same incentive against </v>

1915
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:56.114
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana sales would cut down on the </v>

1916
01:26:58.761 --> 01:27:00.560
<v Speaker 1>sales of pharmaceutical drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.170
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another really gross,</v>

1918
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.093
<v Speaker 1>a part of the system is that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these drugs are actually created in our </v>

1919
01:27:08.361 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 1>universities by researchers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

1920
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.863
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for profit private Pharma companies </v>

1921
01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:14.894
<v Speaker 1>swoop in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they buy up the rights to it for very </v>

1922
01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:17.864
<v Speaker 1>cheap and then they price gouge and sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>it back to the American people for a </v>

1923
01:27:20.871 --> 01:27:21.704
<v Speaker 1>huge profit when it was the taxpayers </v>
<v Speaker 1>who funded the research in the first </v>

1924
01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:25.064
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a way where they screw you </v>

1925
01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:27.164
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay for the creation of it </v>

1926
01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:29.744
<v Speaker 1>and the research of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they get the rights to it and </v>

1927
01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 1>then they sell it back to you again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack up the price.</v>

1928
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And then it's even worse than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's this guy,</v>

1929
01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Alex is our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the head of the head of health and</v>

1930
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:42.230
<v Speaker 1>human services now trump appointed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy worked for Eli.</v>

1931
01:27:42.231 --> 01:27:43.064
<v Speaker 1>Lilly was a price Gouger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked up the prices massively now as </v>

1932
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 1>the head of health and human services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what he's in charge of lowering</v>

1933
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:50.654
<v Speaker 1>drug prices.</v>

1934
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 1>So this is super transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hilarious.</v>

1935
01:27:56.290 --> 01:27:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the brilliance of trump,</v>

1936
01:27:57.951 --> 01:27:58.784
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brilliance of trump is that he goes </v>

1937
01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:03.770
<v Speaker 1>out there and he says like he's populist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his antiestablishment.</v>

1938
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:05.900
<v Speaker 1>But if you go issue for issue on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>

1939
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.830
<v Speaker 1>he is massively pro establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the consumer financial protection</v>

1940
01:28:09.831 --> 01:28:10.664
<v Speaker 1>bureau is the perfect example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He picked a predatory payday lender to </v>

1941
01:28:13.761 --> 01:28:15.590
<v Speaker 1>lead the consumer financial protection </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureau.</v>

1942
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>That bureau returned 11 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>$12,000,000,000</v>

1943
01:28:18.651 --> 01:28:21.470
<v Speaker 1>to defrauded Americans when big </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial institution screwed them.</v>

1944
01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1945
01:28:22.611 --> 01:28:23.444
<v Speaker 1>let's make that worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's handcuff that agency and put a </v>

1946
01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:28.790
<v Speaker 1>predatory payday lender in charge of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all.</v>

1947
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:29.773
<v Speaker 1>It's comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It's comical like people wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this to.</v>

1949
01:28:32.361 --> 01:28:33.194
<v Speaker 1>I follow this stuff on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose my damn mind when I read this </v>

1950
01:28:35.361 --> 01:28:36.194
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about your ability to follow </v>

1951
01:28:37.461 --> 01:28:38.210
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

1952
01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:39.043
<v Speaker 1>You have so much access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so much time on your hands and </v>

1953
01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:41.864
<v Speaker 1>this is a main focal point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the average person is not going </v>

1954
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:47.270
<v Speaker 1>to get this data and I don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blaming.</v>

1955
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never own a shame.</v>

1956
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have.</v>

1957
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:53.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no bandwidth because no way it's</v>

1958
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:54.560
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1960
01:28:56.031 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 1>how many people know what you just said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not many,</v>

1961
01:28:57.651 --> 01:28:58.484
<v Speaker 1>but that's my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job is to come out here and to say </v>

1962

<v Speaker 1>plug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1966
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.533
<v Speaker 1>but this is my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job is to come out here and tell </v>

1967
01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:14.160
<v Speaker 1>people what I read and what I follow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom line is guys,</v>

1968
01:29:14.161 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to come across as </v>
<v Speaker 1>partisan in any way.</v>

1969
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Bernie Sanders.</v>

1970
01:29:17.521 --> 01:29:18.354
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Donald Trump or Hillary </v>

1971
01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my whole thing is I want a system </v>

1972
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:23.183
<v Speaker 1>that is based on common sense and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and it's logical and it helps </v>

1973
01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Bernie's not going to run.</v>

1974
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I think he might think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might.</v>

1975
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard a word about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1976
01:29:33.211 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 1>he has been making some moves behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

1977
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you see a solid station person </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing him,</v>

1978
01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:40.080
<v Speaker 1>try to get ahold of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1979
01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They faked us out.</v>

1980
01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:43.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a Bernie 20 slash 20 dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>

1981
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.430
<v Speaker 1>The other sending the email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to get to him,</v>

1982
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.960
<v Speaker 1>talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know him,</v>

1983
01:29:48.961 --> 01:29:52.470
<v Speaker 1>but I know people who do know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to him about his posture.</v>

1984
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Fix so many things about the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive him.</v>

1985
01:29:56.370 --> 01:30:01.370
<v Speaker 1>We can move his head from the center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his chest and put it in a normal place.</v>

1986
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:02.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1987
01:30:02.101 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about trump is posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how a person's supposed to be.</v>

1988
01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:08.660
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>slashing two men.</v>

1989
01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been normal.</v>

1990
01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Have Bernie's head is down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the wrong spot.</v>

1991
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Those trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1992
01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:20.880
<v Speaker 1>look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look where his head is.</v>

1993
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:22.373
<v Speaker 1>Look at up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you find a picture of him right </v>

1994
01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His head is way lower than it's supposed</v>

1995
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:29.430
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your head's supposed to be up here.</v>

1996
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.220
<v Speaker 1>See where my shoulders there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that picture of burning.</v>

1997
01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Now Watch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the same.</v>

1998
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 1>This is my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

1999
01:30:36.170 --> 01:30:38.450
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are my neck is sore my shoulders.</v>

2000
01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:39.323
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's doing a little dance </v>

2001
01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph doing with Jackie Mason.</v>

2002
01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I call you a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm trump or Bernie,</v>

2003
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do.</v>

2004
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:49.710
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to have your head so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far down on your chest right there.</v>

2005
01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has terrible posture.</v>

2006
01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.513
<v Speaker 1>You know I've said this about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody laughs at his orange face and </v>

2007
01:30:56.731 --> 01:30:59.670
<v Speaker 1>is dyed blonde hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually think that that does make</v>

2008
01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:03.660
<v Speaker 1>him look younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The orange face in the blonde hair,</v>

2009
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:04.523
<v Speaker 1>it probably does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gives him some sort of life because </v>

2010
01:31:06.361 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2011
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:09.830
<v Speaker 1>let's say he didn't do the comb over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't die the hair,</v>

2012
01:31:09.850 --> 01:31:12.210
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have the orange face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would be like,</v>

2013
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:13.103
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a really senile old grandpa </v>

2014
01:31:15.271 --> 01:31:16.104
<v Speaker 1>who was ranting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been people who've done </v>

2015
01:31:17.791 --> 01:31:21.030
<v Speaker 1>photoshops and what he would look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>without hair and with white,</v>

2016
01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:22.163
<v Speaker 1>with white skin will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that thing when he was </v>

2017
01:31:24.121 --> 01:31:27.690
<v Speaker 1>getting on Air Force One and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a demon dude.</v>

2018
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even there,</v>

2019
01:31:29.641 --> 01:31:30.474
<v Speaker 1>he's got some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got and he's got the orange in his </v>

2020
01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:33.060
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see,</v>

2021
01:31:33.061 --> 01:31:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I would respect him if his hair looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2022
01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.310
<v Speaker 1>When I see him with his hair all fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>swirled around.</v>

2023
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2024
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to defend trump now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe.</v>

2025
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of makeup.</v>

2026
01:31:45.150 --> 01:31:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Just got a lot of makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2027
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:47.063
<v Speaker 1>I'm stunned at the dedication he has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the comb over because this is probably </v>

2028
01:31:50.581 --> 01:31:54.300
<v Speaker 1>like an hour long project every day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he does it every day.</v>

2029
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:56.850
<v Speaker 1>He's probably watching Fox and friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tweeting.</v>

2030
01:31:56.851 --> 01:31:58.090
<v Speaker 1>As somebody who's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>

2031
01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.253
<v Speaker 1>do you think someone does it for them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is try to find the video of him walking </v>

2032
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 1>up the ramp to Air Force One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas hair,</v>

2033
01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.730
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2034
01:32:07.731 --> 01:32:12.731
<v Speaker 1>the skin suit on where it's like it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pops off.</v>

2035
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>He's pretending to be a human.</v>

2036
01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.513
<v Speaker 1>He's rotting from the inside and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just barely keeping it together because </v>

2037
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 1>that's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the image that there's a direct</v>

2038
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:22.744
<v Speaker 1>behind angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the angle because you see how </v>

2039
01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:26.230
<v Speaker 1>there's just a giant bald spot back </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2040
01:32:26.231 --> 01:32:27.760
<v Speaker 1>He does a really good job of covering </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2041
01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.750
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so crazy.</v>

2042
01:32:29.751 --> 01:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got trump hair gift,</v>

2043
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.900
<v Speaker 1>it might come up that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go with.</v>

2044
01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2045
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2046
01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Now you could hear the horror movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise as that happens.</v>

2047
01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:42.463
<v Speaker 1>Like the weird thing is like look how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the hair coming from on the </v>

2048
01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:46.594
<v Speaker 1>sides?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how is there so much hair on the </v>

2049
01:32:48.431 --> 01:32:50.040
<v Speaker 1>side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a work of our jail.</v>

2050
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Like watch it goes up the stairs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait for it.</v>

2051
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

2052
01:32:56.381 --> 01:32:57.214
<v Speaker 1>A wing that wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has he not know that that wing is </v>

2053
01:33:00.131 --> 01:33:04.570
<v Speaker 1>flopping around the amount of baldness </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the back of his head.</v>

2054
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:08.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's growing hair only on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of his head.</v>

2055
01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually when people lose their hair,</v>

2056
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:15.220
<v Speaker 1>that back portion still grows hair at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very back and his didn't streaming.</v>

2057
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demon.</v>

2058
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:18.583
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2059
01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:20.933
<v Speaker 1>So here he go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step by step on how to do a trump </v>

2060
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 1>haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like some fucking English.</v>

2061
01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could've been.</v>

2062
01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I could've been swayed into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on there.</v>

2063
01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I actually do think that this,</v>

2064
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.170
<v Speaker 1>it does ultimately make them look </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

2065
01:33:34.190 --> 01:33:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2066
01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2067
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:38.410
<v Speaker 1>With that picture of him balled up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2068
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Scroll up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2069
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 1>That picture right there on that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

2070
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:45.550
<v Speaker 1>The bottom rail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one next to it.</v>

2071
01:33:45.551 --> 01:33:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2072
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what he would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2073
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I looked fine there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that looks fine?</v>

2074
01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he thinks he's not 70,</v>

2075
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but I think he looks like a pudgy uncle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fester then our chance.</v>

2076
01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:59.560
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a shit about his hair.</v>

2077
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:00.663
<v Speaker 1>One of the things is a problem with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's not very manly to spend that </v>

2078
01:34:03.791 --> 01:34:06.790
<v Speaker 1>much time combing and spraying.</v>

2079
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:07.623
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially for a billionaire in his </v>

2080
01:34:09.101 --> 01:34:09.934
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if you're like 20 and </v>

2081
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.270
<v Speaker 1>you're panicking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

2082
01:34:13.271 --> 01:34:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going ball before my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2083
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:19.240
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking 70 and you're worth what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty dollars,</v>

2084
01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.980
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably way more now.</v>

2085
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's profited massively from being </v>

2086
01:34:23.261 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 1>inside the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of.</v>

2087
01:34:24.911 --> 01:34:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about that because.</v>

2088
01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody focuses in mainstream media on</v>

2089
01:34:29.681 --> 01:34:32.380
<v Speaker 1>the Muller investigation and his ties to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and stuff like that.</v>

2090
01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:33.483
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody's missing the bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>story because the bigger stories that </v>

2091
01:34:36.011 --> 01:34:36.844
<v Speaker 1>there are two different emoluments cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are proceeding against trump and </v>

2092
01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:42.190
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is in the constitution,</v>

2093
01:34:42.191 --> 01:34:44.980
<v Speaker 1>there's the emoluments clause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically says that a president of</v>

2094
01:34:44.981 --> 01:34:45.814
<v Speaker 1>the United States cannot take money from</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign governments because there's a </v>

2095
01:34:49.361 --> 01:34:50.800
<v Speaker 1>conflict of interest problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take.</v>

2096
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:53.980
<v Speaker 1>If I take money from whatever name the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

2097
01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

2098
01:34:55.121 --> 01:34:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

2099
01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>if I do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

2100
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.813
<v Speaker 3>of course you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>incentivized to do policy in favor of </v>

2101
01:35:01.011 --> 01:35:03.950
<v Speaker 3>those countries and not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's best for the American people.</v>

2102
01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:04.993
<v Speaker 3>And there are two court cases against </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump that have proceeded in federal </v>

2103
01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.650
<v Speaker 3>court on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So while everybody's screaming about the</v>

2104
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:10.484
<v Speaker 3>Mueller investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're missing the even bigger </v>

2105
01:35:11.841 --> 01:35:12.674
<v Speaker 3>corruption scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were talking about Saudi </v>

2106
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:14.953
<v Speaker 3>Arabia earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Saudi state of trump's hotel and </v>

2107
01:35:16.971 --> 01:35:19.700
<v Speaker 3>paid 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or $300,000</v>

2108
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:21.200
<v Speaker 3>and they didn't even fricking stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2109
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.273
<v Speaker 3>So why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that because they're trying to </v>

2110
01:35:23.511 --> 01:35:26.090
<v Speaker 3>make it so that when they give him a </v>
<v Speaker 3>call and say,</v>

2111
01:35:26.091 --> 01:35:27.600
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the $100,000,000,000</v>

2112
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 3>weapons deal trumps like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2113
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.750
<v Speaker 3>because he's got more money in his bank </v>
<v Speaker 3>account as a result of the Saudis.</v>

2114
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Similar thing happened with Israel on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way in.</v>

2115
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:37.123
<v Speaker 3>I'm jared cushner and some other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the trump administration spoke to a </v>

2116
01:35:41.850 --> 01:35:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Israeli officials about how Obama and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kerry on their way out the door,</v>

2117
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:47.600
<v Speaker 3>we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2118
01:35:47.601 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Israel stopped with the illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>settlements.</v>

2119
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:52.400
<v Speaker 3>It was just a little slap on the wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was more symbolic than anything else,</v>

2120
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:54.980
<v Speaker 3>but Israel was calling the trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration and saying,</v>

2121
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:55.873
<v Speaker 3>we want you to try to kill this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course jared Kushner has taken </v>

2122
01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:02.510
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars from Israeli banks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he has investments over there,</v>

2123
01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:03.344
<v Speaker 3>so there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a president of either </v>

2124
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:06.614
<v Speaker 3>party taking money from foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments because then they're going </v>

2125
01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:10.274
<v Speaker 3>to do those governments bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge problem and I don't see </v>

2126
01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:13.604
<v Speaker 3>anybody talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I see them talking about is Mahler </v>

2127
01:36:15.321 --> 01:36:16.250
<v Speaker 3>and Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

2128
01:36:16.251 --> 01:36:17.084
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

2129
01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.460
<v Speaker 3>and it's been the only guy that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>been president.</v>

2130
01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 3>That really has been a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 3>business to this extent for sure,</v>

2131
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:25.750
<v Speaker 3>or at least that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be clear up.</v>

2132
01:36:25.751 --> 01:36:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a way before I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2133
01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.173
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2134
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 3>it's dark because everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an issue.</v>

2135
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows,</v>

2136
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was one of the issues about </v>

2137
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Russia is that he was trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotels in Moscow.</v>

2138
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:43.970
<v Speaker 3>He did that with rush aided that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan.</v>

2139
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:46.880
<v Speaker 3>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pissed off China early on because,</v>

2140
01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:47.714
<v Speaker 3>and this was maybe not as big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he took a phone call from the head </v>

2141
01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:53.570
<v Speaker 3>of Taiwan and China does not want Taiwan</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognized as its own thing.</v>

2142
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:57.140
<v Speaker 3>And so that caused a huge diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis because then China was like,</v>

2143
01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:58.360
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

2144
01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:59.293
<v Speaker 3>don't talk to them as if they're their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own independent thing and come to find </v>

2145
01:37:01.371 --> 01:37:04.280
<v Speaker 3>out he was working on a deal to put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotel in Taiwan.</v>

2146
01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:05.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2147
01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.200
<v Speaker 3>what is the deal with China?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan versus China?</v>

2148
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.780
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the detailed history that I</v>

2149
01:37:11.781 --> 01:37:15.410
<v Speaker 3>just know that China considers Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's and Taiwan says,</v>

2150
01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:16.790
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are our own thing.</v>

2151
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.713
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's one of those issues where </v>

2152
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:22.430
<v Speaker 3>when Husana we on there because um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2153
01:37:22.730 --> 01:37:24.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough about it to give you</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2154
01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:25.573
<v Speaker 3>to give you an opinion on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me like China saying I </v>

2155
01:37:29.331 --> 01:37:31.010
<v Speaker 3>want that to be ours and them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2156
01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:31.844
<v Speaker 3>that seems like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it seems like you should even </v>

2157
01:37:34.371 --> 01:37:34.840
<v Speaker 3>endless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2158
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:35.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm the type of person who says let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to work it out in the US at however </v>

2159
01:37:38.691 --> 01:37:39.524
<v Speaker 3>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it really came to the point </v>

2160
01:37:40.551 --> 01:37:41.121
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2161
01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Texas was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

2163
01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Y and Z.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we have the right to tell them?</v>

2164
01:37:46.071 --> 01:37:47.450
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2165
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was Taiwan was a part of China.</v>

2166
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2167
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Up until.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2168
01:37:52.941 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2169
01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:55.411
<v Speaker 3>I try to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

2170
01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2171
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I try to be totally up front about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

2172
01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 1>That part of that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking that this was,</v>

2173
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were saying this is unprecedented</v>

2174
01:38:03.661 --> 01:38:08.280
<v Speaker 1>for the president of United States to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to Taiwan when really China's got</v>

2175
01:38:08.281 --> 01:38:09.114
<v Speaker 1>a giant issue with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could cause huge international </v>

2176
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:11.904
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a big crisis behind the </v>

2177
01:38:13.771 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it though.</v>

2178
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Well I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They was.</v>

2179
01:38:16.561 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 1>It was only a story for a day or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't know too many details of it.</v>

2180
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Have you been following at all the Ted </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz versus Beta O'rourke race?</v>

2181
01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:24.293
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say Ted Cruz should be voted </v>

2182
01:38:26.971 --> 01:38:30.990
<v Speaker 1>out simply because he's Ted Cruz because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'm at with Ted Cruz.</v>

2183
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a fool.</v>

2184
01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:35.050
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so smarmy.</v>

2185

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2186
01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite parts of the election</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a.</v>

2187
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:41.603
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy with sunglasses on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was at some sort of campaign rally </v>

2188
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

2189
01:38:46.711 --> 01:38:47.480
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

2195
01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

2196
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:56.394
<v Speaker 1>You're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the guy who was a trump </v>

2197

<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like wearing sunglasses.</v>

<v Speaker 1>look at you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't because he's such a fake gun.</v>

2201

<v Speaker 1>Show fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see trump manhandle him in </v>

2202
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the debate when he tried to bring up New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York values?</v>

2203
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:18.534
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a favorite ted Cruz</v>
<v Speaker 1>things though was the excerpts of his </v>

2206
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:25.420
<v Speaker 1>commercial when he was setting up those </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials and he had all the outtakes.</v>

2207
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom prays for me for hours.</v>

2208
01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:30.323
<v Speaker 1>She's like speaking the Fox business gop</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate Ted Cruz and Donald trump </v>

2209
01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:36.230
<v Speaker 1>discussed New York values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work values on.</v>

2210
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play it,</v>

2211
01:39:37.981 --> 01:39:38.814
<v Speaker 1>play it again from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people know exactly what New York </v>

2212
01:39:41.341 --> 01:39:42.174
<v Speaker 1>values</v>

2213
01:39:42.730 --> 01:39:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I am from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're from New York City.</v>

2214
01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:46.624
<v Speaker 3>You might not,</v>

2215
01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 7>but I promise you in South Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 7>listen,</v>

2216
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:54.750
<v Speaker 7>there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>many</v>

2217
01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:55.763
<v Speaker 3>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful working men and women in the </v>

2218
01:39:57.271 --> 01:40:02.271
<v Speaker 3>state of New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone understands that the values</v>

2219
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:03.444
<v Speaker 3>in New York City are socially liberal or</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro abortion are pro gay marriage focus </v>

2220
01:40:08.491 --> 01:40:13.140
<v Speaker 3>around money and the media and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess I can frame it another way.</v>

2221
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of conservatives come out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Manhattan.</v>

2222
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.313
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying</v>

2223
01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:26.730
<v Speaker 8>conservatives actually do come out of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Manhattan,</v>

2224
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:31.731
<v Speaker 8>including William F Buckley and others.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just so you understand this place.</v>

2225
01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.980
<v Speaker 8>It's got great people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of loving people,</v>

2226
01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:38.520
<v Speaker 8>wonderful people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When the World Trade Center came down,</v>

2227
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.480
<v Speaker 8>I saw something that no place on earth </v>
<v Speaker 8>could have handled more beautifully,</v>

2228
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:50.270
<v Speaker 8>more humanely than New York to 110 story</v>
<v Speaker 8>buildings come crashing down.</v>

2229
01:40:51.181 --> 01:40:56.181
<v Speaker 8>I saw them come down and we saw more </v>
<v Speaker 8>death and even the smell of death.</v>

2230
01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.230
<v Speaker 8>Nobody understood it and it was with us </v>
<v Speaker 8>for months.</v>

2231
01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:00.363
<v Speaker 8>The smell the air and we rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 8>downtown Manhattan and everybody in the </v>

2232
01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 8>world watched and everybody in the world</v>
<v Speaker 8>love New York and love New Yorkers and I</v>

2233
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:10.864
<v Speaker 8>have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that was a very insulting statement </v>

2234
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:14.463
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

2235
01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that could have been handled better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't like trump's response and was</v>

2236
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.990
<v Speaker 1>sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sucks,</v>

2237
01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:26.530
<v Speaker 1>but he's just shitting on a whole state </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a partisan hack prick.</v>

2238
01:41:26.590 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I understand that the way he handled it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't.</v>

2239
01:41:28.661 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 1>But I got to admit it was a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

2240
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That ted such a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm watching trump stand there.</v>

2241
01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you get some.</v>

2242
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's so fake.</v>

2243
01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:36.993
<v Speaker 1>Everything is so preplanned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the video you were talking about is </v>

2244
01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:41.380
<v Speaker 1>probably an even better example where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2245
01:41:41.381 --> 01:41:42.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending like he's sitting there with </v>

2246
01:41:43.781 --> 01:41:44.320
<v Speaker 1>his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2247
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caden did eat your Broccoli.</v>

2248
01:41:46.630 --> 01:41:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Buckley's from England though.</v>

2249
01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he lived in Manhattan </v>

2250
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:51.250
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2251
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the Gore Vidal William </v>
<v Speaker 1>F Buckley debates those?</v>

2252
01:41:54.911 --> 01:41:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it called the best of enemies?</v>

2253
01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.113
<v Speaker 1>What was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was on firing line his </v>

2254
01:41:59.141 --> 01:41:59.380
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2255
01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.041
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2256
01:42:00.041 --> 01:42:00.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2257
01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:03.070

<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that with a thing.</v>

2258
01:42:03.071 --> 01:42:03.904
<v Speaker 1>It's called the best of enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a about the 19 sixties debates </v>

2259
01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.910
<v Speaker 1>between buckling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that best of enemies?</v>

2260

2262
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pissed off Buckley to the point where</v>

2263
01:42:17.681 --> 01:42:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Buckley called him a faggot and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2264
01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:21.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2265
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the way he said it.</v>

2266
01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:27.100

<v Speaker 1>he lived in la or Hollywood out of place</v>

2271

<v Speaker 1>in Ravello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2272
01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.010
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2273
01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I was up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2274
01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I was put it took a picture from </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>

2275
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:50.830
<v Speaker 1>This word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gore Vidal used to bank dudes,</v>

2276
01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks respect.</v>

2277
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of guava dog.</v>

2278
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:57.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>

2279
01:42:57.790 --> 01:43:01.630
<v Speaker 1>But I liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got under William F Buckley's skin so</v>

2280
01:43:01.631 --> 01:43:04.210
<v Speaker 1>bad that Buckley fell apart during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebates.</v>

2281
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking screamed at him.</v>

2282
01:43:05.951 --> 01:43:06.784
<v Speaker 1>He's red in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because he was </v>

2283
01:43:08.501 --> 01:43:12.430
<v Speaker 1>calling him a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gore Vidal was calling me a Nazi.</v>

2284
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw 'em on Youtube.</v>

2285
01:43:14.891 --> 01:43:18.910
<v Speaker 1>They have William f Buckley versus Noam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chomsky and you've got the thing that he</v>

2286
01:43:18.911 --> 01:43:20.770
<v Speaker 1>said back in the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2287
01:43:21.110 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 1>68 is fascinating to watch that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really nerdy and wonky and you</v>

2288
01:43:25.751 --> 01:43:26.584
<v Speaker 1>love politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go watch William F dot Buckley versus </v>

2289
01:43:27.941 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Noam Chomsky because it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2290
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:32.440
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to watch it and be like,</v>

2291
01:43:32.441 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

2292
01:43:34.290 --> 01:43:36.700
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls the words you queer.</v>

2293
01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more than that,</v>

2294
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:39.970
<v Speaker 1>so I was trying to find the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2295
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:44.140
<v Speaker 1>you could find the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he would punch him.</v>

2296
01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Who is this on Netflix day plastered or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2297
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He said more than the word queer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this on Netflix?</v>

2298
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it is.</v>

2299
01:43:54.411 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 1>After you got to tell me the name may </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be on Netflix.</v>

2300
01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely on itunes.</v>

2301
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you call them a queer,</v>

2302
01:44:01.461 --> 01:44:05.210
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called him a homosexual slur and then</v>

2303
01:44:05.211 --> 01:44:06.044
<v Speaker 1>he threatened to knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threatened to sock him or whatever </v>

2304
01:44:09.561 --> 01:44:10.394
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the red in the face and the </v>

2305
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.680
<v Speaker 1>fucking eyeballs twitching and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the end for William f Buckley and it</v>

2306
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:20.060
<v Speaker 1>was during an official like debate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were having.</v>

2307
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:22.820
<v Speaker 1>It was during the series of debates at </v>
<v Speaker 1>ABC put on.</v>

2308
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.923
<v Speaker 1>They put on a series of debates and Gore</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vidal was doing better and then William </v>

2309
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:29.750
<v Speaker 1>f Buckley was kind of a cunt in Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vidal was mocking him.</v>

2310
01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:33.820
<v Speaker 1>He very pompous polymath Buckley was </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross.</v>

2311
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:35.263
<v Speaker 1>It's just weirdly grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it showed how he fell apart from </v>

2312
01:44:37.941 --> 01:44:38.774
<v Speaker 1>that statement on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was kind of the end of people </v>

2313
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:44.210
<v Speaker 1>taking them completely seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People now look back at him through rose</v>

2314
01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 1>colored glasses and they act like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2315
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:47.660
<v Speaker 1>he's such a brilliant intellectual.</v>

2316
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like what they do with Reagan.</v>

2317
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Reagan was an embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2318
01:44:52.670 --> 01:44:53.481
<v Speaker 1>because they used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2319
01:44:53.481 --> 01:44:55.090
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Late in his time in office,</v>

2320
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:57.890
<v Speaker 1>weren't there questions about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not he had dementia?</v>

2321
01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

2322
01:44:59.450 --> 01:45:00.283
<v Speaker 1>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember during the Iran Contra </v>

2323
01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:05.570
<v Speaker 1>debates or the Iran contra trials where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked him,</v>

2324
01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:07.460
<v Speaker 1>did you sell arms to Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2325
01:45:07.461 --> 01:45:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kept saying,</v>

2326
01:45:08.811 --> 01:45:09.644
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could have been a tactic to try to </v>

2327
01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:11.650
<v Speaker 1>get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2328
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:12.483
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

2329
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:14.220
<v Speaker 1>He was losing it if he didn't hear it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

2330
01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:16.483
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is even older than the Chompsky </v>

2331
01:45:16.961 --> 01:45:17.160
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2332
01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.020
<v Speaker 9>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Here in the United States,</v>

2333
01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:22.063
<v Speaker 9>I happen to believe that the United </v>
<v Speaker 9>States policy is wrong in Vietnam and </v>

2334
01:45:25.321 --> 01:45:29.160
<v Speaker 9>the Viet Cong are correct and wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 9>organize it in their own way.</v>

2335
01:45:29.161 --> 01:45:29.994
<v Speaker 9>Politically happens to be pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 9>the western Europe and other parts of </v>

2336
01:45:33.901 --> 01:45:34.734
<v Speaker 9>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If it was a novelty in Chicago that is </v>

2337
01:45:36.841 --> 01:45:37.674
<v Speaker 9>too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I assume that the point of the </v>

2338
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:43.930
<v Speaker 9>American democracy got up a minute and </v>
<v Speaker 9>the answer is that they will.</v>

2339
01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.753
<v Speaker 9>They will well treated by people who was</v>
<v Speaker 9>precise them and I'm for ostracizing </v>

2340
01:45:51.271 --> 01:45:55.540
<v Speaker 9>people who egg on other people to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 9>American Marines and American soldiers.</v>

2341
01:45:59.370 --> 01:46:04.370
<v Speaker 9>Crypto Nazi I can think of is yourself </v>
<v Speaker 9>failing that I listened to you gentlemen</v>

2342
01:46:15.190 --> 01:46:20.190
<v Speaker 9>his pornography and stop making any </v>
<v Speaker 9>illusions of infantry in the last war.</v>

2343
01:46:25.650 --> 01:46:29.280
<v Speaker 1>That started as a debate on Vietnam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then by the end they were.</v>

2344
01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Now that's even seems like a big deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

2345
01:46:32.821 --> 01:46:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It was probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness.</v>

2346
01:46:34.381 --> 01:46:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I was probably on every a nightly news </v>
<v Speaker 1>show you queer,</v>

2347
01:46:37.801 --> 01:46:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll suck you in their face and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay plastered like that's almost like a</v>

2348
01:46:42.661 --> 01:46:46.900
<v Speaker 1>rapper dis suck you when you face in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your steep plessy.</v>

2349
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bit,</v>

2350
01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little</v>

2351
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.260
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the documentary is fantastic.</v>

2352
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 6>It looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We should definitely go check that out.</v>

2353
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 6>It's really good to give me the name </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it's get out of here.</v>

2354
01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.233
<v Speaker 6>It's the best of enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really good because it just shows </v>

2355
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:00.804
<v Speaker 6>you like the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The time that they lived in it was just </v>

2356
01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:08.630
<v Speaker 6>a different world and that ABC was so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2357
01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:10.573
<v Speaker 6>they were able to have this on national </v>
<v Speaker 6>television and have debates on policies </v>

2358
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:15.984
<v Speaker 6>and on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on politics between to recognize </v>

2359
01:47:17.791 --> 01:47:18.930
<v Speaker 6>intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one on the right,</v>

2360
01:47:18.931 --> 01:47:19.764
<v Speaker 6>one on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is something that they did on </v>

2361
01:47:21.421 --> 01:47:23.310
<v Speaker 6>national television.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a big success.</v>

2362
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time I was,</v>

2363
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.903
<v Speaker 3>I was very anti debate and still to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent today I feel like I'm anti </v>

2364
01:47:29.311 --> 01:47:30.144
<v Speaker 3>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason I am is because I feel </v>

2365
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:31.914
<v Speaker 3>like it's a wwe of intellectual pursuits</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's more of a show and it's more </v>

2366
01:47:35.461 --> 01:47:37.980
<v Speaker 3>about sophistry and it's more about </v>
<v Speaker 3>being quick on your feet.</v>

2367
01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Then who has the right arguments and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think that's good.</v>

2368
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:43.200
<v Speaker 3>But then the other argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm,</v>

2369
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:44.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm warming up to this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's such a better way to get </v>

2370
01:47:47.611 --> 01:47:50.210
<v Speaker 3>people to watch and listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when,</v>

2371
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:52.980
<v Speaker 3>when you get really wonky and just have </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with people,</v>

2372
01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:53.873
<v Speaker 3>many people just kind of tune out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because it doesn't keep their </v>

2373
01:47:55.441 --> 01:47:56.274
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what will keep their attention is a </v>

2374
01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:59.960
<v Speaker 3>zinger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you know how to deliver zingers in</v>

2375
01:47:59.961 --> 01:48:02.790
<v Speaker 3>into debate and you can get more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch and agree with you,</v>

2376
01:48:02.791 --> 01:48:05.160
<v Speaker 3>then it's almost almost like a necessary</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil to do it.</v>

2377
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 3>So I decided for the political thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2378
01:48:07.591 --> 01:48:08.424
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I will debate and I'll </v>

2379
01:48:10.081 --> 01:48:12.390
<v Speaker 3>debate mostly because my audience wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>me to debate.</v>

2380
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I think my audience likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They Tucker Carlson.</v>

2381
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:14.991
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2382
01:48:14.991 --> 01:48:15.411
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jake.</v>

2383
01:48:15.411 --> 01:48:16.680
<v Speaker 3>You were debated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tucker Carlson,</v>

2384
01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.633
<v Speaker 3>who you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to divide was going to </v>

2385
01:48:18.121 --> 01:48:21.090
<v Speaker 3>debate and culture and culture pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2386
01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she had the nerve to go on,</v>

2387
01:48:23.791 --> 01:48:25.820
<v Speaker 3>good morning la and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2388
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:27.810
<v Speaker 3>these liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they chickened out of debating me.</v>

2389
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 3>So she just blatantly lied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She backed out of the debate with me and</v>

2390
01:48:31.951 --> 01:48:34.710
<v Speaker 3>then she goes on TV and says no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she says her though,</v>

2391
01:48:34.711 --> 01:48:36.120
<v Speaker 3>isn't that what she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a troll,</v>

2392
01:48:36.121 --> 01:48:37.740
<v Speaker 3>but here's the reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's her reasoning.</v>

2393
01:48:37.770 --> 01:48:40.080
<v Speaker 3>It was so smug and so elitist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2394
01:48:40.110 --> 01:48:42.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many best sellers does he have?</v>

2395
01:48:43.890 --> 01:48:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't write books.</v>

2396
01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't write books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guarantee you write books like the</v>

2397
01:48:51.730 --> 01:48:52.563
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you I had way more </v>

2398
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:56.460
<v Speaker 3>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secular talk listeners there.</v>

2399
01:48:56.461 --> 01:48:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Then she had an culture fans and let me </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you something,</v>

2400
01:48:58.770 --> 01:48:59.603
<v Speaker 3>even I have people who are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative in my own family and when </v>

2401
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 3>they heard I was debating in culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2402
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Every single one of them said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that bitch.</v>

2403
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:07.343
<v Speaker 3>I don't like her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these are people who agree way more </v>

2404
01:49:09.150 --> 01:49:10.890
<v Speaker 3>with her than they do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2405
01:49:10.891 --> 01:49:15.420
<v Speaker 3>she's not really a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a troll and she's a heck yeah,</v>

2406
01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:16.254
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she even believes what </v>

2407
01:49:17.161 --> 01:49:18.420
<v Speaker 3>she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2408
01:49:18.421 --> 01:49:19.254
<v Speaker 3>in one of the reasons why I say that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the way Bill Maher treats or he </v>

2409
01:49:21.331 --> 01:49:23.680
<v Speaker 3>laughs and jokes around with it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2410
01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a wink and a nod with her.</v>

2411
01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hustle.</v>

2412
01:49:28.231 --> 01:49:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I think she's an entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true.</v>

2413
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:32.460
<v Speaker 3>And I remember back during the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2414
01:49:32.461 --> 01:49:33.294
<v Speaker 3>nobody was more in favor of the Iraq war</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thought it was the greatest thing </v>

2415
01:49:36.391 --> 01:49:37.680
<v Speaker 3>ever and would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2416
01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:38.603
<v Speaker 3>make fun of people who are against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when trump rose up through the </v>

2417
01:49:41.371 --> 01:49:44.730
<v Speaker 3>republican ranks and he was bashing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq war,</v>

2418
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.650
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it when he did that.</v>

2419
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.240
<v Speaker 3>All the sudden she went on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she hopped on the trump train.</v>

2420
01:49:49.241 --> 01:49:50.860
<v Speaker 3>When all the other candidates on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>

2421
01:49:50.861 --> 01:49:51.694
<v Speaker 3>we're not bashing the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she flipped on this major issue that </v>

2422
01:49:54.611 --> 01:49:57.220
<v Speaker 3>defined five years of her so-called </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual life.</v>

2423
01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be real,</v>

2424
01:49:59.160 --> 01:49:59.993
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't remember when she was </v>

2425
01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 3>talking about invading Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something about Canada's Canada not</v>

2426
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:08.980
<v Speaker 3>supporting us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll fucking invade them over Iraq.</v>

2427
01:50:08.981 --> 01:50:10.900
<v Speaker 3>It was like it was something along those</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

2428
01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Vaguely remember what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2429
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Something like this pitch out of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind when she said,</v>

2430
01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:15.874
<v Speaker 3>we need to invade a one of these Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and just forcibly converted </v>

2431
01:50:19.061 --> 01:50:21.130
<v Speaker 3>everybody there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things she said.</v>

2432
01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:23.050
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real man.</v>

2433
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:27.880
<v Speaker 3>These are the fact that she's still gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>considered for debates.</v>

2434
01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.480
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she's.</v>

2435
01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:32.230
<v Speaker 3>She's just disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it would've been.</v>

2436
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I would've been screaming at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2437
01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:36.090
<v Speaker 3>a wall basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the person I knew would have,</v>

2438
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 3>it would have been wonderful seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody says that the corral that lady</v>

2439
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:42.850
<v Speaker 3>into taking the stage with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be fantastic.</v>

2440
01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Can Run circles around her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up debating Scottie Nell Hughes,</v>

2441
01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:46.834
<v Speaker 3>who was big on TV during the 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 3>election and she was a trump backer and </v>

2442
01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:50.314
<v Speaker 3>now she's on our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually she ended up being very </v>

2443
01:50:52.151 --> 01:50:52.690
<v Speaker 3>reasonable.</v>

2444
01:50:52.690 --> 01:50:53.523
<v Speaker 3>I'd say we actually ended up agreeing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 65 percent of the issues and we </v>

2445
01:50:55.961 --> 01:50:57.760
<v Speaker 3>had some pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some strong disagreements,</v>

2446
01:50:57.761 --> 01:51:00.880
<v Speaker 3>but mostly agreeing and I think it was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fruitful conversation.</v>

2447
01:51:00.881 --> 01:51:01.714
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if the audience liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as much as they would've liked me </v>

2448
01:51:03.311 --> 01:51:04.430
<v Speaker 3>bashing culture said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2449
01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:05.890
<v Speaker 3>the audience probably would've liked it </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

2450
01:51:05.891 --> 01:51:09.070
<v Speaker 3>But it's nice when those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations where people do agree on a</v>

2451
01:51:09.071 --> 01:51:09.904
<v Speaker 3>lot of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even regardless of what side they're </v>

2452
01:51:11.921 --> 01:51:14.950
<v Speaker 3>supposedly on do take place because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes people.</v>

2453
01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:18.250
<v Speaker 3>It gives people hope and the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable discourse.</v>

2454
01:51:18.251 --> 01:51:23.020
<v Speaker 3>So then you would have absolutely loved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a panel with Charlie Kirk,</v>

2455
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.120
<v Speaker 3>have turning point USA and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2456
01:51:25.190 --> 01:51:27.070
<v Speaker 3>close with candice son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 12 years old.</v>

2457
01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.830
<v Speaker 3>He's young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not really,</v>

2458
01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:29.950
<v Speaker 3>he's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's my dean.</v>

2459
01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:30.971
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2460
01:51:30.971 --> 01:51:32.200
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking of a different person.</v>

2461
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.610
<v Speaker 3>He's a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're joking.</v>

2462
01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As fairly in your face.</v>

2463
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:37.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very literal dude.</v>

2464
01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.160
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes stuff goes right over my </v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

2465
01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:41.013
<v Speaker 3>but we were on hand as they sold girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>scout cookies together that I would </v>

2466
01:51:43.631 --> 01:51:44.780
<v Speaker 3>actually believe her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

2467
01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was on a panel called,</v>

2468
01:51:47.441 --> 01:51:48.274
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to get along?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Kirk was one of the panelists </v>

2469
01:51:50.111 --> 01:51:51.250
<v Speaker 3>now going into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2470
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to agree with this dude on</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely anything.</v>

2471
01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.653
<v Speaker 3>But when we got in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I did is I tried to frame issues </v>

2472
01:51:59.141 --> 01:52:03.850
<v Speaker 3>from what his ideology is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he says he's a conservative.</v>

2473
01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:04.961
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2474
01:52:04.961 --> 01:52:07.450
<v Speaker 3>that means typically you believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller government.</v>

2475
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:08.531
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2476
01:52:08.531 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 3>here's some areas where I believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller government,</v>

2477
01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:11.253
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to stop the warrantless </v>
<v Speaker 3>NSA spying or we're collecting </v>

2478
01:52:13.331 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 3>everybody's information without their </v>
<v Speaker 3>approval.</v>

2479
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:17.900
<v Speaker 3>And without a warrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2480
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:19.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that we need to stop the drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

2481
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2482
01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:23.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our invasions of other countries </v>

2483
01:52:25.721 --> 01:52:26.554
<v Speaker 3>because that takes a big government and </v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of dollars to do these </v>

2484
01:52:28.061 --> 01:52:30.400
<v Speaker 3>invasions and rebuild countries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things of that nature.</v>

2485
01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.670
<v Speaker 3>And I even said on the death penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2486
01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.380
<v Speaker 3>we should probably stop that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>about six percent of the time we get the</v>

2487
01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:37.570
<v Speaker 3>wrong people and probably shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>

2488
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.640
<v Speaker 3>And on virtually every one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2489
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.863
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Kirk agreed with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He even agreed with me on the issue of </v>

2490
01:52:42.971 --> 01:52:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Saudi Arabia where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2491
01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they</v>

2492
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:47.240
<v Speaker 1>said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2493
01:52:47.241 --> 01:52:49.700
<v Speaker 1>we like law and order and the law and </v>
<v Speaker 1>order president is Donald Trump.</v>

2494
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really like law and order,</v>

2495
01:52:50.901 --> 01:52:53.750
<v Speaker 1>you'd be against the trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration arming $110,000,000,000</v>

2496
01:52:53.751 --> 01:52:56.110
<v Speaker 1>worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Charlie Kirk,</v>

2497
01:52:56.111 --> 01:52:57.350
<v Speaker 1>to his credit goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2498
01:52:57.351 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

2499
01:52:58.610 --> 01:53:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Now the other guy on the panel was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute pack.</v>

2500
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 1>He's a Milo Wannabe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his actual,</v>

2501
01:53:03.411 --> 01:53:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2502
01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.600
<v Speaker 1>it was clear he was doing an act and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a daily wire,</v>

2503
01:53:08.601 --> 01:53:10.580
<v Speaker 1>third stringer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's Ben Shapiro's thing,</v>

2504
01:53:10.581 --> 01:53:13.370
<v Speaker 1>but he's a low level guy and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear,</v>

2505
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:14.263
<v Speaker 1>I swear to you joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about how I'm very pro </v>

2506
01:53:16.551 --> 01:53:17.384
<v Speaker 1>life and I need you to know that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>very pro life and this is something I </v>

2507
01:53:19.461 --> 01:53:21.260
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My response to him was,</v>

2508
01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:23.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to know that you're against the</v>

2509
01:53:23.151 --> 01:53:25.970
<v Speaker 1>death penalty and immediately without </v>
<v Speaker 1>skipping a beat,</v>

2510
01:53:25.971 --> 01:53:26.804
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for the death penalty and the </v>

2511
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:32.270
<v Speaker 1>audience laughs and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2512
01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:34.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to walk right into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>trap every time,</v>

2513
01:53:34.151 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very easy debate now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2514
01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:40.590
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with Milo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the last I,</v>

2515
01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I should be asking you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know the dude.</v>

2516
01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard a peep out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no,</v>

2517
01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:44.781
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2518
01:53:44.781 --> 01:53:45.614
<v Speaker 1>I think his whole thing imploded because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an article that came out and </v>

2519
01:53:47.901 --> 01:53:50.600
<v Speaker 1>they have like correspondence between </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and literal,</v>

2520
01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 1>like actual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2521
01:53:51.861 --> 01:53:53.990
<v Speaker 1>People were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just kind of doing puff pieces</v>

2522
01:53:53.991 --> 01:53:54.824
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my understanding of it and he </v>

2523
01:53:56.271 --> 01:53:58.590
<v Speaker 1>kind of disappeared after that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily he was,</v>

2524
01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 1>he was with Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did a few shows with Alex Jones.</v>

2525
01:54:01.071 --> 01:54:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I was the last I saw of puff pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2526
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:04.183
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trying to make it seem like they </v>

2527
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:06.314
<v Speaker 1>aren't what they actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was partying with Richard </v>

2528
01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Spencer and they were singing together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was weird.</v>

2529
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a weird character.</v>

2530
01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:16.563
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely a weird character but I </v>

2531
01:54:18.771 --> 01:54:22.940
<v Speaker 1>actually enjoyed talking with him off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and I felt like there's a lot of</v>

2532
01:54:22.941 --> 01:54:24.950
<v Speaker 1>what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the tricks.</v>

2533
01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2534
01:54:26.241 --> 01:54:27.074
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell because it's hard to </v>

2535
01:54:29.481 --> 01:54:30.314
<v Speaker 1>tell like how much of how much of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think is theatrical is them being </v>

2536
01:54:34.251 --> 01:54:35.084
<v Speaker 1>theatrical when the aunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on air and how much is </v>

2537
01:54:36.771 --> 01:54:41.771
<v Speaker 1>theatrical when they're talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to be endearing off here?</v>

2538
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is hard to tell,</v>

2539
01:54:46.611 --> 01:54:47.444
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you can see it when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are people who kind of get involved in </v>

2540
01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:52.124
<v Speaker 1>this political space is awesome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really all they want to do is just </v>

2541
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:58.490
<v Speaker 1>become famous and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't be the point.</v>

2542
01:54:58.491 --> 01:55:00.710
<v Speaker 1>You should really get in on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>political thing because you actually are</v>

2543
01:55:00.711 --> 01:55:01.880
<v Speaker 1>really interested in politics.</v>

2544
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it comes down to.</v>

2545
01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

2546
01:55:05.010 --> 01:55:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a nerd.</v>

2547
01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why I didn't expect my thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get the.</v>

2548
01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first started,</v>

2549
01:55:09.471 --> 01:55:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I really thought maybe in my wildest </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams I'll get to 100,000</v>

2550
01:55:14.361 --> 01:55:17.150
<v Speaker 1>subscribers on youtube and as I talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you right now,</v>

2551
01:55:17.151 --> 01:55:21.440
<v Speaker 1>we're almost about to cross 600,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I never expected any of this.</v>

2552
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I never expected any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that it happened.</v>

2553
01:55:24.231 --> 01:55:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just grateful for it.</v>

2554
01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:28.310
<v Speaker 1>While you're an intelligent guy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>very reasonable points,</v>

2555
01:55:28.311 --> 01:55:30.470
<v Speaker 1>so you deserve all the credit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten,</v>

2556
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:31.633
<v Speaker 1>but you are also honest like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are your actual opinions and this </v>

2557
01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:37.094
<v Speaker 1>is your actual perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with someone like Ann </v>

2558
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:40.663
<v Speaker 1>Coulter or someone like many of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that I see out there that </v>

2559
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to name</v>

2560
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:46.820
<v Speaker 6>is that they're hustlers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They found an end.</v>

2561
01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 6>There's an in for a certain type of </v>
<v Speaker 6>conservative person.</v>

2562
01:55:51.541 --> 01:55:54.850
<v Speaker 6>There's an end for a certain type of </v>
<v Speaker 6>democratic persons and in for.</v>

2563
01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:57.180
<v Speaker 6>I mean I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's pro women,</v>

2564
01:55:57.181 --> 01:55:58.920
<v Speaker 6>people that don't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 6>women.</v>

2565
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:00.570
<v Speaker 6>They're bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

2566
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.823
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're supposed feminists when they're </v>

2567
01:56:02.971 --> 01:56:05.400
<v Speaker 6>just narcissists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of that out there.</v>

2568
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:10.200
<v Speaker 6>There's men's rights activists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They really only care about finding this</v>

2569
01:56:10.201 --> 01:56:13.950
<v Speaker 6>way into a group of people where if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have their support,</v>

2570
01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:18.450
<v Speaker 6>there's just a large conglomeration of </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and you can sort of take them in as</v>

2571
01:56:18.451 --> 01:56:19.740
<v Speaker 6>your fans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you feel.</v>

2572
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:21.690
<v Speaker 6>Do you feel like that died down a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>bit?</v>

2573
01:56:21.691 --> 01:56:23.430
<v Speaker 6>The men's rights activist thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2574
01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:24.323
<v Speaker 6>I feel like there were maybe three years</v>
<v Speaker 6>ago it was very big and then now it's </v>

2575
01:56:26.121 --> 01:56:29.370
<v Speaker 6>kind of it about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit from them,</v>

2576
01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:29.730
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2577
01:56:29.730 --> 01:56:33.890
<v Speaker 6>Then they would ship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2578
01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 6>having them be upset at me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck,</v>

2579
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:39.390
<v Speaker 6>but my bit was that every men's rights </v>
<v Speaker 6>activists I ever met,</v>

2580
01:56:39.391 --> 01:56:40.710
<v Speaker 6>I just want to grab and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2581
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:43.890
<v Speaker 6>we got them all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>

2582
01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.300
<v Speaker 6>We run everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Almost everything.</v>

2583
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.393
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea is that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that I don't think men should have </v>

2584
01:56:48.691 --> 01:56:50.550
<v Speaker 6>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's just we've got them.</v>

2585
01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that my thing in the bit was what if</v>

2586
01:56:54.961 --> 01:56:55.794
<v Speaker 6>women start to pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>things men actually did when they </v>

2587
01:56:57.541 --> 01:56:57.991
<v Speaker 6>started going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2588
01:56:57.991 --> 01:57:00.090
<v Speaker 6>we just realized you guys caused all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>war,</v>

2589
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:01.223
<v Speaker 6>every single war ever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's like if you met women caused </v>

2590
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:04.643
<v Speaker 6>all the war would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well we got to kill these fucking crazy </v>

2591
01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.640
<v Speaker 6>bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The want to do is go to war.</v>

2592
01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:10.560
<v Speaker 6>This was in your most recent special,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2593
01:57:10.561 --> 01:57:11.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>

2594
01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:14.670
<v Speaker 6>And it was thought out there was some of</v>
<v Speaker 6>them were upset at me,</v>

2595
01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:16.710
<v Speaker 6>but like that's a pretty bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 6>argument.</v>

2596
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:17.723
<v Speaker 6>Like the only men's rights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our argument that's legitimate is </v>

2597
01:57:21.421 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 6>divorce laws.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>

2598
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:24.020
<v Speaker 6>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we're in,</v>

2599
01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:24.913
<v Speaker 6>we're in when it comes to alimony and </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to child support and when </v>

2600
01:57:28.621 --> 01:57:30.720
<v Speaker 6>it comes to child custody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2601
01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:32.273
<v Speaker 6>totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are men Nigga fucked over and I </v>

2602
01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:34.974
<v Speaker 6>know guys that have gotten fucked over </v>
<v Speaker 6>in that regard and you know what courts </v>

2603
01:57:39.690 --> 01:57:40.523
<v Speaker 6>tend to side towards the mother and even</v>
<v Speaker 6>if the most deceptive and if the mother </v>

2604
01:57:44.281 --> 01:57:45.114
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2605
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.043
<v Speaker 6>they'll say something like he beats the </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids or I think he might've done </v>

2606
01:57:48.871 --> 01:57:49.704
<v Speaker 6>something sexual to the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's women have done horrible things </v>

2607
01:57:52.531 --> 01:57:53.364
<v Speaker 6>like that and they've done that to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>more money or they've gotten done that </v>

2608
01:57:56.191 --> 01:57:57.120
<v Speaker 6>to get custody of.</v>

2609
01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:00.210
<v Speaker 6>They'd done that just for spite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But this is just.</v>

2610
01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:01.093
<v Speaker 6>This is a matter of the courts being </v>
<v Speaker 6>designed to work the situation system </v>

2611
01:58:05.641 --> 01:58:06.474
<v Speaker 6>being designed to protect kids and </v>
<v Speaker 6>protect the mother who needs to get </v>

2612
01:58:09.571 --> 01:58:10.404
<v Speaker 6>money to be able to take care of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>children because there's a lot of </v>

2613
01:58:12.061 --> 01:58:13.930
<v Speaker 6>fucking shitty deadbeat dads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

2614
01:58:13.931 --> 01:58:17.460
<v Speaker 6>if there were no dead beat dads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if men always paid child support,</v>

2615
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.863
<v Speaker 6>then this would be far less of an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The issue is the reason why women can </v>

2616
01:58:22.441 --> 01:58:25.080
<v Speaker 6>exploit it is because so many men were </v>
<v Speaker 6>pieces of shit.</v>

2617
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:26.080
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It.</v>

2618
01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:31.080
<v Speaker 6>It created this need for some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of law that set some something</v>

2619
01:58:34.081 --> 01:58:37.040
<v Speaker 6>that's set to protect children and to </v>
<v Speaker 6>protect women with.</v>

2620
01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:39.270
<v Speaker 6>With that get custody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2621
01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:42.490
<v Speaker 6>and now it looks like the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>With the divorce issue and everything,</v>

2622
01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:43.324
<v Speaker 6>the pendulum swung a little too far in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the other direction and there's this </v>

2623
01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 6>default setting which is actually not </v>
<v Speaker 6>too good for the guy.</v>

2624
01:58:49.650 --> 01:58:50.483
<v Speaker 6>The guy you're talking about too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I saw that podcast a long time </v>

2625
01:58:52.631 --> 01:58:53.464
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was one of the people you </v>

2626
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:56.350
<v Speaker 6>work with on news radio or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just one of them.</v>

2627
01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:59.290
<v Speaker 6>That's just one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know many people that have been fucked</v>

2628
01:58:59.291 --> 01:59:02.350
<v Speaker 6>over by by divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you know,</v>

2629
01:59:02.351 --> 01:59:03.184
<v Speaker 6>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a good friend of mine who I've </v>

2630
01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:09.040
<v Speaker 6>talked about them on the podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has been divorced for 14 years.</v>

2631
01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:12.910
<v Speaker 6>He has been married to a new woman for </v>
<v Speaker 6>12 years.</v>

2632
01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:18.040
<v Speaker 6>He still pays alimony.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only does he still pay alimony,</v>

2633
01:59:18.041 --> 01:59:18.874
<v Speaker 6>he pays alimony to tone of more than a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hundred thousand dollars a year to a </v>

2634
01:59:22.091 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 6>woman that he doesn't have sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he can't retire.</v>

2635
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:27.370
<v Speaker 6>He cannot retire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This woman has a boyfriend.</v>

2636
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:29.380
<v Speaker 6>She lives in his house,</v>
<v Speaker 6>old house,</v>

2637
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:31.680
<v Speaker 6>my friend's old house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She owns the house.</v>

2638
01:59:31.770 --> 01:59:32.603
<v Speaker 6>They don't have any children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the idea that he fucked her so </v>

2639
01:59:35.651 --> 01:59:36.940
<v Speaker 6>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She can't work again.</v>

2640
01:59:37.450 --> 01:59:41.320
<v Speaker 6>Like she's not 80 years old man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean she's now in her fifties.</v>

2641
01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:46.330
<v Speaker 6>That's almost like indentured servitude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking insane to give me $100,000</v>

2642
01:59:46.331 --> 01:59:47.570
<v Speaker 6>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's giving.</v>

2643
01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:49.420
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's tapered down to like,</v>

2644
01:59:49.421 --> 01:59:52.000
<v Speaker 6>I think it's now at $150,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>a year,</v>

2645
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:53.043
<v Speaker 6>but at one point he was paying a quarter</v>
<v Speaker 6>million dollars a year and he's paid or </v>

2646
01:59:56.261 --> 01:59:59.230
<v Speaker 6>that for 12 fucking or 14 fucking years </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

2647
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 6>Fourteen years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been married to a woman for 12.</v>

2648
02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:03.693
<v Speaker 6>He has a family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has a family and asked to send money </v>

2649
02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:07.780
<v Speaker 6>to this lady.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't talk to anymore.</v>

2650
02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:10.060
<v Speaker 6>Like she can't move on with their life </v>
<v Speaker 6>and if he doesn't,</v>

2651
02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:11.710
<v Speaker 6>he gets locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he doesn't,</v>

2652
02:00:11.711 --> 02:00:12.940
<v Speaker 6>he goes to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2653
02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:13.893
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's trying to go to court and she </v>

2654
02:00:15.251 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 6>fights it and she lives with her </v>
<v Speaker 6>boyfriend and when they send people over</v>

2655
02:00:19.331 --> 02:00:21.820
<v Speaker 6>to check the boyfriend puts his stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a fucking u haul,</v>

2656
02:00:21.821 --> 02:00:24.490
<v Speaker 6>drives around the block weights and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>comes back.</v>

2657
02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:25.510
<v Speaker 6>So what if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

2658
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.800
<v Speaker 6>let's say he loses his job and he can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>find another job for whatever reason.</v>

2659
02:00:30.190 --> 02:00:32.380
<v Speaker 6>He's lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just always the money no matter what.</v>

2660
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:35.250
<v Speaker 6>And there's no like you can't go back in</v>
<v Speaker 6>front of a court and they can read,</v>

2661
02:00:35.410 --> 02:00:35.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2662
02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:37.990
<v Speaker 6>take it down or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

2663
02:00:37.991 --> 02:00:40.870
<v Speaker 6>I mean that you'd have to go to court </v>
<v Speaker 6>and a judge would have to agree,</v>

2664
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:41.704
<v Speaker 6>but he's a successful man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's part of the problem is he's not </v>

2665
02:00:44.351 --> 02:00:46.920
<v Speaker 6>going to be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's an ambitious guy,</v>

2666
02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:49.180
<v Speaker 6>does really well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He works very hard.</v>

2667
02:00:49.181 --> 02:00:52.870
<v Speaker 6>He works 10,</v>
<v Speaker 6>12 hours every day and he has for ever.</v>

2668
02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:55.240
<v Speaker 6>And He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's smart.</v>

2669
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:58.420
<v Speaker 6>He's good at his job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And because of this,</v>

2670
02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:01.650
<v Speaker 6>he has to pay this woman that he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck anymore forever.</v>

2671
02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:03.130
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2672
02:01:03.131 --> 02:01:04.840
<v Speaker 6>It's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a nightmare.</v>

2673
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:07.030
<v Speaker 6>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like she's not,</v>

2674
02:01:07.570 --> 02:01:11.680
<v Speaker 6>she's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's not in a hospital bed.</v>

2675
02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:14.980
<v Speaker 6>It's not like she can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like she's,</v>

2676
02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.113
<v Speaker 6>she's totally capable of making a living</v>
<v Speaker 6>and she now has probably four or five </v>

2677
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:21.094
<v Speaker 6>plastic surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She is the person we were talking about </v>

2678
02:01:22.121 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 6>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know me.</v>

2679
02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:26.530
<v Speaker 6>Maybe she went,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she fits the route.</v>

2680
02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.420
<v Speaker 6>Maybe she went the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2681
02:01:28.421 --> 02:01:32.630
<v Speaker 6>But the idea that my friend has to pay </v>
<v Speaker 6>her and every now and then you know,</v>

2682
02:01:32.650 --> 02:01:33.280
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>

2683
02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:34.270
<v Speaker 6>we'll talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

2684
02:01:34.271 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 6>you still have to pay her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she'll just go,</v>

2685
02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.570
<v Speaker 6>oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's fucking.</v>

2686
02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>got a family.</v>

2687
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:41.143
<v Speaker 1>He's got a wife and he has children with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new woman and he's happy and he </v>

2688
02:01:45.341 --> 02:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>still has to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that $2,000</v>

2689
02:01:49.191 --> 02:01:50.024
<v Speaker 1>a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 plus a just an absolute nightmare </v>

2690
02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a check for $2,000.</v>

2691
02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know anymore.</v>

2692
02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>So speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is somewhat related to what</v>

2693
02:02:01.791 --> 02:02:02.624
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what did you make of the cabinet </v>

2694
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2695
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2696
02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:08.913
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent a lot of time over the last </v>

2697
02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>week paying attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2698
02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>This happened to a little longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just caught up on it,</v>

2699
02:02:15.231 --> 02:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you're saying for awhile it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is gross.</v>

2700
02:02:17.901 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>This is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>

2701
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>When the main thing was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just weren't paying attention to it,</v>

2702
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:23.743
<v Speaker 1>but over the last week of paid a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it and here's my take on </v>

2703
02:02:27.201 --> 02:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2704
02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>

2705
02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that got me was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2706
02:02:33.590 --> 02:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that got me is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like most of his,</v>

2707
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>most of his life and his young life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was fucked up.</v>

2708
02:02:42.590 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>He was drinking a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see,</v>

2709
02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>read the yearbook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the year?</v>

2710
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2711
02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:47.133
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the stuff about like on the </v>

2712
02:02:49.581 --> 02:02:50.414
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he had his calendar and then when </v>

2713
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>things were scheduled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beers were scheduled.</v>

2714
02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very busy.</v>

2715
02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And he was so like frat boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douchey,</v>

2716
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>like all this stuff he said was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliquey.</v>

2717
02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also lied.</v>

2718
02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly.</v>

2719
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dashawn.</v>

2720
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:11.870
<v Speaker 1>That alone is all I need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2721
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:15.500
<v Speaker 1>he said goofing is farting and goofing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course means fucking.</v>

2722
02:03:15.501 --> 02:03:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2723
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's a liar.</v>

2724
02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:20.413
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he perjured himself and saying </v>

2725
02:03:21.891 --> 02:03:23.100
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't know.</v>

2726
02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:23.993
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats didn't even mention </v>

2727
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.210
<v Speaker 1>perjury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2728
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>they just kinda laid down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just kinda laid down.</v>

2729
02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:32.060
<v Speaker 1>My whole thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a gross spectacle.</v>

2730
02:03:32.061 --> 02:03:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2731
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:33.553
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that even the hearings </v>

2732
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:35.384
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it was a little bit of a </v>

2733
02:03:37.041 --> 02:03:37.874
<v Speaker 1>clown show because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we are the most powerful </v>

2734
02:03:39.981 --> 02:03:42.080
<v Speaker 1>organization in the most powerful body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This government,</v>

2735
02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:42.914
<v Speaker 1>United States government where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having this hearing and we're talking </v>

2736
02:03:44.541 --> 02:03:46.310
<v Speaker 1>about drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened in the 19 eighties.</v>

2737
02:03:46.610 --> 02:03:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It just struck me as so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

2738
02:03:50.031 --> 02:03:52.310
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was screaming about,</v>

2739
02:03:52.311 --> 02:03:53.144
<v Speaker 1>and I might may have literally been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only person in the country screaming </v>

2740
02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:56.173
<v Speaker 1>about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually went through cavenaugh as a </v>

2741
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:59.143
<v Speaker 1>judicial record with a fine tooth comb </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I disagree with him on basically </v>

2742
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.040
<v Speaker 1>every decision he's ever made.</v>

2743
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's not an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's for warrantless NSA spying.</v>

2744
02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He rules with corporations 87 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2745
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:12.740
<v Speaker 1>He said that all of Obamacare is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconstitutional.</v>

2746
02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>He ruled that the EPA can not regulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>greenhouse gas emissions.</v>

2747
02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:17.023
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he even goes as far as to say Donald </v>

2748
02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Trump might be able to pardon himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2749
02:04:20.751 --> 02:04:21.441
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2750
02:04:21.441 --> 02:04:22.274
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the reasons why they </v>

2751
02:04:23.211 --> 02:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>think that Donald Trump was getting him </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

2752
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's also part of the Patriot Act.</v>

2753
02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:28.611
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2754
02:04:28.611 --> 02:04:31.790
<v Speaker 1>That's like the end of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization type shit because you can't</v>

2755
02:04:31.791 --> 02:04:34.310
<v Speaker 1>have somebody above rule of law that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dictator for.</v>

2756
02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>That's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that drove me crazy,</v>

2757
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that here you have</v>

2758
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:38.843
<v Speaker 3>on all those important issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear a single democratic </v>

2759
02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 3>politician bring that up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>

2760
02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.860
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't at all about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>accusations.</v>

2761
02:04:46.861 --> 02:04:47.694
<v Speaker 3>It was all about the act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you can't bring up the </v>

2762
02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 3>accusations at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can bring it up,</v>

2763
02:04:51.481 --> 02:04:52.314
<v Speaker 3>especially because some of them seem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have decent amount of evidence on their </v>

2764
02:04:54.841 --> 02:04:55.674
<v Speaker 3>side and seemed very measured and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable in their comments so you can </v>

2765
02:04:57.421 --> 02:04:59.220
<v Speaker 3>bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just annoyed me that there wasn't</v>

2766
02:04:59.221 --> 02:05:03.780
<v Speaker 3>like a two pronged strategy and trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to defeat it because the Democrats suck.</v>

2767
02:05:03.781 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suck because it just to suck.</v>

2768
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:09.180
<v Speaker 3>They suck in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't think there's any pressure to</v>

2769
02:05:09.181 --> 02:05:11.160
<v Speaker 3>not bring up those issues?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2770
02:05:11.161 --> 02:05:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

2771
02:05:12.061 --> 02:05:13.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Chuck Schumer,</v>

2772
02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:14.694
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut a deal with Donald Trump just </v>

2773
02:05:15.751 --> 02:05:18.960
<v Speaker 3>recently and he let them approve like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the exact number.</v>

2774
02:05:18.961 --> 02:05:21.240
<v Speaker 3>You guys can fact check me on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six or 10 different.</v>

2775
02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:22.213
<v Speaker 3>A Jew of trump's judges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he cut a deal to approve them so the </v>

2776
02:05:26.251 --> 02:05:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Democrats can go back home and campaign </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the upcoming election,</v>

2777
02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:30.091
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2778
02:05:30.091 --> 02:05:30.924
<v Speaker 3>douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why you guys are struggling </v>

2779
02:05:33.271 --> 02:05:35.460
<v Speaker 3>in elections is because you don't stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>for anything,</v>

2780
02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:36.294
<v Speaker 3>so those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you to fight on those judges </v>

2781
02:05:37.441 --> 02:05:38.274
<v Speaker 3>because you're not supposed to agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with those judges because that's the </v>

2782
02:05:39.751 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn opposition party.</v>

2783
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:42.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2784
02:05:42.291 --> 02:05:43.124
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand why they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>bring up all those issues that you </v>

2785
02:05:45.081 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 6>talked about before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's 15.</v>

2786
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.210
<v Speaker 6>See I even formations of 15 trump </v>
<v Speaker 6>judges.</v>

2787
02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:51.073
<v Speaker 6>Look.</v>

2788
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:54.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see this is my problem with them is </v>

2789
02:05:56.031 --> 02:05:56.864
<v Speaker 3>that you could give them an issue like </v>
<v Speaker 3>take legalizing marijuana that in </v>

2790
02:05:59.231 --> 02:06:03.990
<v Speaker 3>exchange dems facing reelection can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>home to campaign.</v>

2791
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:06.950
<v Speaker 3>How ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what the Democrats do,</v>

2792
02:06:06.951 --> 02:06:07.784
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that like we were talking earlier </v>

2793
02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:09.494
<v Speaker 3>about marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty two percent of the country now </v>

2794
02:06:11.151 --> 02:06:11.984
<v Speaker 3>wants legal marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only democratic politicians talking </v>

2795
02:06:14.031 --> 02:06:16.520
<v Speaker 3>about it is Bernie Sanders and maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 3>handful of others.</v>

2796
02:06:16.610 --> 02:06:19.670
<v Speaker 3>And if they ran on these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can name a thousand others,</v>

2797
02:06:19.671 --> 02:06:21.010
<v Speaker 3>like raising the minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2798
02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:23.000
<v Speaker 3>ending the wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they run those issues,</v>

2799
02:06:23.001 --> 02:06:24.080
<v Speaker 3>they'd win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just don't do it.</v>

2800
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:25.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2801
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.213
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The cavanaughs take on all those issues </v>

2802
02:06:28.201 --> 02:06:29.580
<v Speaker 6>are pretty fucking vile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2803
02:06:29.650 --> 02:06:33.900
<v Speaker 6>but it did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All those things disturb me.</v>

2804
02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:38.630
<v Speaker 6>What disturbed me most about what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were talking about in terms of his youth</v>

2805
02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:41.310
<v Speaker 6>wasn't that he did bad things in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>youth.</v>

2806
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:44.020
<v Speaker 6>It's that he's lying about them now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2807
02:06:44.021 --> 02:06:44.550
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2808
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:45.930
<v Speaker 6>If he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2809
02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:48.390
<v Speaker 6>when I was 17 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was stupid,</v>

2810
02:06:48.391 --> 02:06:52.170
<v Speaker 6>like many 17 year olds and I drank,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I never raped anybody.</v>

2811
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:53.263
<v Speaker 6>Did stupid things and maybe I acted </v>
<v Speaker 6>insensitively and maybe I said some </v>

2812
02:06:56.371 --> 02:06:58.350
<v Speaker 6>things that I shouldn't have said </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I was a fool.</v>

2813
02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.393
<v Speaker 6>I am not a fool anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And now I'm a judge and now I think it </v>

2814
02:07:02.521 --> 02:07:05.430
<v Speaker 6>would make a great supreme court justice</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he could say that,</v>

2815
02:07:05.431 --> 02:07:06.264
<v Speaker 6>but he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got angry and like same like I've </v>

2816
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:10.680
<v Speaker 6>watched the video of him saying,</v>

2817
02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I'd like beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like it.</v>

2818
02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 3>He's asking a senator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you like it?</v>

2819
02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you like it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

2820
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that fucking mean?</v>

2821
02:07:18.211 --> 02:07:21.510
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about you as a teenager </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's illegal to drink you stupid.</v>

2822
02:07:21.511 --> 02:07:22.344
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also did a little slight of hand </v>

2823
02:07:23.251 --> 02:07:24.600
<v Speaker 3>there and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2824
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:27.450
<v Speaker 3>most of the seniors at the time could </v>
<v Speaker 3>legally drink.</v>

2825
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why'd you say most of the seniors?</v>

2826
02:07:29.251 --> 02:07:30.084
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the seniors were talking about </v>

2827
02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:31.854
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't legally allowed to drink at </v>

2828
02:07:32.791 --> 02:07:33.990
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're right,</v>

2829
02:07:33.991 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 3>you're exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem</v>

2830
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.113
<v Speaker 1>was the lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could've just said exactly what you </v>

2831
02:07:39.041 --> 02:07:40.210
<v Speaker 1>laid out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't do it.</v>

2832
02:07:40.211 --> 02:07:41.044
<v Speaker 1>Which again speaks to his credibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of funny that the one </v>

2833
02:07:43.511 --> 02:07:45.790
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he did do that to her,</v>

2834
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the one woman who turns out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

2835
02:07:49.811 --> 02:07:54.811
<v Speaker 1>it's hugely progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super liberal university who it's almost</v>

2836
02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 1>predominantly women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you looked at how many women are</v>

2837
02:07:58.781 --> 02:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>professors at the university and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many women's.</v>

2838
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like 79 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the women are 70.</v>

2839
02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Nine percent of the students are women </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the university.</v>

2840
02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And in some large number of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors are women as well.</v>

2841
02:08:11.110 --> 02:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2842
02:08:11.890 --> 02:08:14.730
<v Speaker 1>well at least one of the allegations </v>
<v Speaker 1>were bullshit against him.</v>

2843
02:08:15.690 --> 02:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You know who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2844
02:08:16.570 --> 02:08:17.403
<v Speaker 1>Michael have a naughty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That anti-trump grifter who just wants </v>

2845
02:08:19.301 --> 02:08:21.280
<v Speaker 1>to get his fucking name in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2846
02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:25.870
<v Speaker 1>he represented some woman and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand holes in her story,</v>

2847
02:08:26.110 --> 02:08:26.943
<v Speaker 1>but this asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wants to get his name in the </v>

2848
02:08:28.121 --> 02:08:29.230
<v Speaker 1>spotlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2849
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:30.103
<v Speaker 1>he adds on to the other accusations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the other exhibitions do have </v>

2850
02:08:33.221 --> 02:08:34.010
<v Speaker 1>merit any.</v>

2851
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.843
<v Speaker 1>He blows up the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the Republicans can turn around </v>

2852
02:08:35.951 --> 02:08:37.810
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what we got here.</v>

2853
02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all bullshit.</v>

2854
02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I think he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Sharpton.</v>

2855
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.600
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a scumbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2856
02:08:43.601 --> 02:08:47.440
<v Speaker 1>he was just a political one where I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's listened.</v>

2857
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:48.333
<v Speaker 1>He came out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came out of nowhere and now he's </v>

2858
02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:53.830
<v Speaker 1>talking about running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck are you?</v>

2859
02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I saw someone say that they think you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be great.</v>

2860
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:58.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they say,</v>

2861
02:08:58.290 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 1>whoever said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking idiot.</v>

2862
02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It was bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2863
02:09:01.601 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>

2864
02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:05.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to like him,</v>

2865
02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 1>but he's gotten progressively worse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

2866
02:09:08.290 --> 02:09:10.060
<v Speaker 1>No Pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on using the word progressive.</v>

2867
02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it was him on Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his show.</v>

2868
02:09:13.661 --> 02:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was him talking about his.</v>

2869
02:09:16.261 --> 02:09:17.350
<v Speaker 1>His argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2870
02:09:17.351 --> 02:09:19.100
<v Speaker 1>because I want a Democrat with balls and</v>

<v Speaker 3>But he like ruined his career as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>result of this.</v>

2947
02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I look at.</v>

2948
02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:25.430
<v Speaker 3>The light that this like on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like fucking 50 percent dislike.</v>

2949
02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Why do you pay attention to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2950
02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:29.390
<v Speaker 3>that's why I told you I got sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a vortex of it.</v>

2951
02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:30.253
<v Speaker 3>You can't pay attention to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not representative of whether or </v>

2952
02:12:32.121 --> 02:12:34.720
<v Speaker 3>not the guy has a career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it boosted his plot.</v>

2953
02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the argument people said</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he did it because even though he's</v>

2954
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:40.160
<v Speaker 3>this photo is sort of what ended it.</v>

2955
02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:44.630
<v Speaker 3>He posted this thing like I when sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this large crowd behind them,</v>

2956
02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:48.380
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't tell them that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening his opening for fall out boy.</v>

2957
02:12:48.381 --> 02:12:50.580
<v Speaker 3>And this is followup boys crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:52.860
<v Speaker 3>He told them he took off his jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the last second,</v>

2959
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:55.760
<v Speaker 3>so everyone turned around for a picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he got booted after this by the</v>

2960
02:12:55.761 --> 02:12:57.620
<v Speaker 3>entire crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he know he got booed?</v>

2961
02:12:57.650 --> 02:13:00.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But did they actually,</v>

2962
02:13:01.150 --> 02:13:04.130
<v Speaker 3>one of the bullying videos was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do remember that.</v>

2963
02:13:04.131 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that he had a Hoodie on or</v>

2964
02:13:06.951 --> 02:13:08.780
<v Speaker 3>something and he took it off before this</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

2965
02:13:08.781 --> 02:13:10.820
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't know that you had that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt on,</v>

2966
02:13:10.821 --> 02:13:13.030
<v Speaker 3>which is the cover of m and m's album.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're right,</v>

2967
02:13:13.031 --> 02:13:16.910
<v Speaker 3>it was fallout boys crab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of a weird weasely move of</v>

2968
02:13:16.911 --> 02:13:17.744
<v Speaker 3>this guy to do.</v>

2969
02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:20.313
<v Speaker 3>I'm sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe's Joe doesn't care about the rap </v>

2970
02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:23.130
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wants to.</v>

2971
02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Not that I don't care about the rap </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

2972
02:13:25.011 --> 02:13:29.540
<v Speaker 3>It's this fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These distracts are so lazy that he took</v>

2973
02:13:29.570 --> 02:13:31.290
<v Speaker 3>the distracts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get me interested again.</v>

2974
02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:32.453
<v Speaker 3>That's what it took to get me interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I remember back when was fifty </v>

2975
02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:35.790
<v Speaker 3>cent versus jd kiss and I fucking loved </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2976
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:38.640
<v Speaker 3>But when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love that.</v>

2977
02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:40.600
<v Speaker 3>The J dot Rapp was one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2978
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:42.540
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was the best battle rap </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever heard.</v>

2979
02:13:42.710 --> 02:13:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about Jay z versus non?</v>

2980
02:13:44.351 --> 02:13:46.530
<v Speaker 3>So that's a classic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a classic.</v>

2981
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.540
<v Speaker 3>And that did nothing but help both of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2982
02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A kid help nas more than help.</v>

2983
02:13:51.941 --> 02:13:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Jay Z dot I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2984
02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.840
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think Jay z versus not has helped.</v>

2985
02:13:56.850 --> 02:13:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Jay Z,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black twitter.</v>

2986
02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Look at it as an expert over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves it.</v>

2987
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:03.163
<v Speaker 3>He gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll come back and tell you who's </v>

2988
02:14:04.051 --> 02:14:04.884
<v Speaker 3>dating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who they run the twitter and all the </v>

2989
02:14:07.231 --> 02:14:10.890
<v Speaker 3>memes of oil comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run twitter.</v>

2990
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:11.743
<v Speaker 3>One 25 percent of twitter memes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is coming out of black </v>

2991
02:14:14.161 --> 02:14:15.660
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five percent.</v>

2992
02:14:15.661 --> 02:14:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Did you do the math?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a known fact,</v>

2993
02:14:18.241 --> 02:14:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2994
02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't pull it out of my ass.</v>

2995
02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2996
02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:24.570
<v Speaker 3>speaking of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you seen all these purges recently?</v>

2997
02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:26.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a new round of it that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2998
02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:27.960
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A purge,</v>

2999
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.823
<v Speaker 3>800 or 800 or more accounts were purged </v>
<v Speaker 3>from facebook and twitter and they're </v>

3000
02:14:34.201 --> 02:14:36.930
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all alternative media accounts.</v>

3001
02:14:37.110 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 3>So some of the sites are snowflakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was One,</v>

3002
02:14:40.171 --> 02:14:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I think on facebook there's another one </v>
<v Speaker 3>called anti media that was purged there,</v>

3003
02:14:44.131 --> 02:14:47.040
<v Speaker 3>an antiwar media thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free thought project is another one.</v>

3004
02:14:47.170 --> 02:14:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Take this and there was cop watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police.</v>

3005
02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:53.780
<v Speaker 3>The police was called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically what they're saying is it's</v>

3006
02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.140
<v Speaker 3>such a bullshit argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

3007
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:56.003
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason we pulled this is because </v>

3008
02:14:57.091 --> 02:14:57.924
<v Speaker 3>it's inauthentic behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're pulling these accounts because </v>

3009
02:15:00.961 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 3>there's inauthentic behavior on those </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounts.</v>

3010
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:04.020
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3011
02:15:04.290 --> 02:15:05.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they never clarified.</v>

3012
02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:07.590
<v Speaker 3>So what I think it means is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3013
02:15:07.591 --> 02:15:08.850
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3014
02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.260
<v Speaker 3>these are alternative media outlets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to get rid of them so we're just</v>

3015
02:15:13.261 --> 02:15:14.094
<v Speaker 3>gonna get rid of them because facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know met with the Israeli government </v>

3016
02:15:16.740 --> 02:15:18.030
<v Speaker 3>and Israel told them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey listen,</v>

3017
02:15:18.031 --> 02:15:18.864
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna be in our country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get rid of certain </v>

3018
02:15:20.701 --> 02:15:22.620
<v Speaker 3>accounts and facebook when right along </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

3019
02:15:22.621 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll do that with China,</v>

3020
02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:25.430
<v Speaker 3>with Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3021
02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.540
<v Speaker 3>But now I think they're doing that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the US now.</v>

3022
02:15:27.541 --> 02:15:28.740
<v Speaker 3>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3023
02:15:28.741 --> 02:15:29.574
<v Speaker 3>I think they're working in cahoots with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the US government and so you have all </v>

3024
02:15:31.591 --> 02:15:34.410
<v Speaker 3>these alternative media counselor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically antiwar.</v>

3025
02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:35.243
<v Speaker 3>What have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anticorruption some of these are okay </v>

3026
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 3>and they're getting purged?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3027
02:15:37.890 --> 02:15:38.723
<v Speaker 3>The argument was inauthentic behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the reasons they cited </v>

3028
02:15:42.301 --> 02:15:44.250
<v Speaker 3>as to why they got rid of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>inauthentic behavior.</v>

3029
02:15:44.251 --> 02:15:45.084
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about instances that they're </v>

3030
02:15:47.611 --> 02:15:49.320
<v Speaker 3>misrepresenting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3031
02:15:49.321 --> 02:15:52.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it means more like bots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I interpreted it.</v>

3032
02:15:52.001 --> 02:15:53.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3033
02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:56.040
<v Speaker 3>you know you're posting it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>directing people to your own,</v>

3034
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:59.850
<v Speaker 3>you know stuff and everybody does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>on facebook and twitter.</v>

3035
02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that that's what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on?</v>

3036
02:16:03.931 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just asking is it possible they were</v>

3037
02:16:06.121 --> 02:16:11.121
<v Speaker 3>using bots and perhaps directing them </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards revenue creating sites or.</v>

3038
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:12.583
<v Speaker 3>My.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My whole thing is why shouldn't that be </v>

3039
02:16:13.621 --> 02:16:14.620
<v Speaker 3>allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3040
02:16:14.710 --> 02:16:15.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying they shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed,</v>

3041
02:16:15.931 --> 02:16:16.764
<v Speaker 3>but is it possible that they were using </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories that were taking place in the </v>

3042
02:16:20.551 --> 02:16:21.384
<v Speaker 3>news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distorting those stories to get people </v>

3043
02:16:22.681 --> 02:16:23.514
<v Speaker 3>to click on things that would have links</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ways that these people can make </v>

3044
02:16:27.211 --> 02:16:28.044
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so instead of it being some sort of </v>

3045
02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>political</v>

3046
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:30.963
<v Speaker 1>activism website that really was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue generating bullshit site that </v>

3047
02:16:35.891 --> 02:16:39.760
<v Speaker 1>was trying to drum up artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage,</v>

3048
02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:40.683
<v Speaker 1>is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for some of them it's certainly </v>

3049
02:16:41.561 --> 02:16:42.690
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly not.</v>

3050
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not for the free thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>

3051
02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.380
<v Speaker 1>What is it free thought project?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another one of these,</v>

3052
02:16:47.381 --> 02:16:48.214
<v Speaker 1>I think they described themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an antiestablishment or anti </v>

3053
02:16:50.171 --> 02:16:51.650
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3054
02:16:51.890 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 1>thing where they cover all these stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to government corruption,</v>

3055
02:16:54.450 --> 02:16:56.980
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a wiki leaks type thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they don't do the Wiki leaks,</v>

3056
02:16:56.981 --> 02:16:57.814
<v Speaker 1>does more of the original reporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and they'll just cover it after </v>

3057
02:16:59.921 --> 02:17:02.800
<v Speaker 1>the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many facebook deleted them?</v>

3058
02:17:02.890 --> 02:17:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I read it in,</v>

3059
02:17:04.430 --> 02:17:05.263
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was an article in the </v>

3060
02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:06.761
<v Speaker 1>Guardian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3061
02:17:06.761 --> 02:17:08.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in pulling it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

3062
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.810
<v Speaker 1>facebook and twitter purge 100 sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you mix it was like,</v>

3063
02:17:13.811 --> 02:17:14.644
<v Speaker 1>I think it was mostly on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 600 or so on facebook and the 200 </v>

3064
02:17:17.381 --> 02:17:18.214
<v Speaker 1>or so on twitter that they did and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them were like one of the accounts </v>

3065
02:17:20.971 --> 02:17:24.160
<v Speaker 1>that over 3 million people who liked it.</v>

3066
02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free thought project,</v>

3067
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:29.200
<v Speaker 1>what has their response been to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3068
02:17:29.410 --> 02:17:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't because I only saw the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

3069
02:17:30.911 --> 02:17:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen anything after it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3070
02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:35.020
<v Speaker 1>this is a discussion that I was having </v>
<v Speaker 1>with red the other day.</v>

3071
02:17:35.050 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 1>We were talking here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First they came for Alex Jones.</v>

3072
02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:40.660
<v Speaker 1>We told you you are next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

3073
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:41.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were next.</v>

3074
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:45.550
<v Speaker 1>We were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is on their website,</v>

3075
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:48.640
<v Speaker 1>but they did cover it in the Guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some other outlets in case anybody's</v>

3076
02:17:48.641 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 1>thinking that this is bs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3077
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:53.023
<v Speaker 1>That's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a scary time because you see that </v>

3078
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:55.940
<v Speaker 1>this can impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3079
02:17:56.590 --> 02:17:58.660
<v Speaker 1>really anybody who's not toeing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

3080
02:17:58.661 --> 02:18:00.010
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a police,</v>

3081
02:18:00.011 --> 02:18:01.810
<v Speaker 1>the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we really gonna like,</v>

3082
02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.820
<v Speaker 1>do we really think that they pulled that</v>
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>

3083
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:04.863
<v Speaker 1>Not for the obvious reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you're sowing discord and </v>

3084
02:18:07.451 --> 02:18:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the police don't like it as part of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>purge.</v>

3085
02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.293
<v Speaker 1>Facebook has removed the pages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>several police accountability watch dog </v>

3086
02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:15.720
<v Speaker 1>critic groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Copblock,</v>

3087
02:18:15.850 --> 02:18:17.920
<v Speaker 1>the free thought project and police the </v>
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>

3088
02:18:18.250 --> 02:18:20.350
<v Speaker 1>They've also apparently severely </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted.</v>

3089
02:18:20.351 --> 02:18:23.890
<v Speaker 1>The activity for the photography is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a crime page.</v>

3090
02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:25.873
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think they're getting pressure </v>

3091
02:18:28.511 --> 02:18:30.400
<v Speaker 1>from law enforcement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3092
02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:31.293
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never usually believe in a smoke </v>

3093
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.863
<v Speaker 1>filled backroom conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're starting to get hard to </v>

3094
02:18:36.821 --> 02:18:38.890
<v Speaker 1>avoid because there's so many of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3095
02:18:38.891 --> 02:18:40.100
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3096
02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:42.220
<v Speaker 1>scroll down please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we need.</v>

3097
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.113
<v Speaker 1>Look at this and how does this poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again says first they came for Alex </v>

3098
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Jones and info wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't race baiting,</v>

3099
02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:50.710
<v Speaker 1>transfer spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cultivated Clemson,</v>

3100
02:18:50.711 --> 02:18:51.730
<v Speaker 1>murdered children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new town.</v>

3101
02:18:51.731 --> 02:18:52.564
<v Speaker 1>Where are hoaxes and admitted in court </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm just an entertainer who makes </v>

3102
02:18:55.731 --> 02:18:57.070
<v Speaker 1>shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said nothing.</v>

3103
02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to be flippant about</v>

3104
02:18:58.301 --> 02:18:59.380
<v Speaker 1>how Alex Jones was pulled.</v>

3105
02:18:59.410 --> 02:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>The problem was once you bought into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of Alex Jones being polled,</v>

3106
02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:04.593
<v Speaker 1>well then what you're saying is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are executives at these companies </v>

3107
02:19:08.171 --> 02:19:10.690
<v Speaker 1>can willy nilly decide whoever they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull down.</v>

3108
02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Now my answer to that has always been we</v>
<v Speaker 1>should take twitter,</v>

3109
02:19:13.841 --> 02:19:15.790
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these giant social media pages.</v>

3110
02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:16.713
<v Speaker 1>They can still be private companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should regulate them like their </v>

3111
02:19:19.181 --> 02:19:20.380
<v Speaker 1>public utilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3112
02:19:20.381 --> 02:19:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the argument that Ari and I were </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing,</v>

3113
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.943
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only answer because you need </v>

3114
02:19:25.031 --> 02:19:28.370
<v Speaker 1>to default to free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying if somebody doxing</v>

3115
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:29.203
<v Speaker 3>somebody or somebody directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening somebody and stuff like </v>

3116
02:19:30.831 --> 02:19:31.664
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be a process set up where </v>

3117
02:19:32.451 --> 02:19:34.040
<v Speaker 3>you can ameliorate that and do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

3118
02:19:34.670 --> 02:19:37.280
<v Speaker 3>But having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people forget man,</v>

3119
02:19:37.281 --> 02:19:41.300
<v Speaker 3>the Acl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used to defend the KKK in course,</v>

3120
02:19:41.470 --> 02:19:42.830
<v Speaker 3>or would already brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3121
02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3122
02:19:43.851 --> 02:19:44.900
<v Speaker 3>in Skokie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

3123
02:19:44.901 --> 02:19:45.734
<v Speaker 3>hey listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know we don't agree with these </v>

3124
02:19:46.491 --> 02:19:47.420
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think they're heinous.</v>

3125
02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:49.070
<v Speaker 3>We think they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think they're dead wrong,</v>

3126
02:19:49.071 --> 02:19:49.904
<v Speaker 3>but they have a right to say what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying because once you get rid </v>

3127
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:53.720
<v Speaker 3>of it for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people don't realize though is that</v>

3128
02:19:53.721 --> 02:19:54.554
<v Speaker 3>these things will always come back </v>
<v Speaker 3>against people who are powerless and </v>

3129
02:19:57.321 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 3>marginalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like when you censor,</v>

3130
02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:01.310
<v Speaker 3>everybody gets together and we all go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3131
02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:02.570
<v Speaker 3>so it's just the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3132
02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the Nazis.</v>

3133
02:20:03.531 --> 02:20:04.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3134
02:20:04.641 --> 02:20:06.050
<v Speaker 3>who's running these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3135
02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:07.093
<v Speaker 3>these organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously they have their own opinions </v>

3136
02:20:09.291 --> 02:20:10.124
<v Speaker 3>and their own vested interests and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own power dynamic issues and they're </v>

3137
02:20:12.711 --> 02:20:13.544
<v Speaker 3>going to take down whoever threatens </v>
<v Speaker 3>their power now is are all these </v>

3138
02:20:16.071 --> 02:20:19.610
<v Speaker 3>organizations still up on youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and Google?</v>

3139
02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To my knowledge,</v>

3140
02:20:20.901 --> 02:20:23.570
<v Speaker 3>the only one that totally got pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>down everywhere I think was Alex Jones.</v>

3141
02:20:23.571 --> 02:20:24.270
<v Speaker 3>He still has</v>

3142
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:26.920
<v Speaker 6>website here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It says all but proving the case.</v>

3143
02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:29.670
<v Speaker 6>This was a coordinated attack by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>tech giant community.</v>

3144
02:20:29.671 --> 02:20:32.820
<v Speaker 6>Shortly after the purge on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>twitter follows suit,</v>

3145
02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:36.680
<v Speaker 6>wiping out our profiles on there as </v>
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

3146
02:20:36.681 --> 02:20:39.290
<v Speaker 6>They gave absolutely no reason for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>suspension.</v>

3147
02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:41.660
<v Speaker 6>Said we had closed the freethought </v>
<v Speaker 6>umbrella,</v>

3148
02:20:41.661 --> 02:20:44.960
<v Speaker 6>had close to 6 million followers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3149
02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:47.540
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they just decided overnight.</v>

3150
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:49.460
<v Speaker 6>What's crazy is I didn't even hear </v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

3151
02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:52.900
<v Speaker 6>Well that's why I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I appreciate you.</v>

3152
02:20:53.610 --> 02:20:56.690
<v Speaker 6>I mean I had heard that it was 800 </v>
<v Speaker 6>different pages,</v>

3153
02:20:56.691 --> 02:20:57.524
<v Speaker 6>but the way I'd read it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I unfortunately don't have a lot of </v>

3154
02:21:01.401 --> 02:21:02.234
<v Speaker 6>time and I was flipping through </v>
<v Speaker 6>something I'd read that it was a lot of </v>

3155
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:07.220
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>anti-police pages.</v>

3156
02:21:07.290 --> 02:21:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Some of them were anti police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of them were not.</v>

3157
02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:13.050
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them were antiestablishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti corruption,</v>

3158
02:21:13.051 --> 02:21:14.550
<v Speaker 3>like they've always had it out for </v>
<v Speaker 3>wikileaks.</v>

3159
02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:16.230
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wiki leaks as well.</v>

3160
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've had mike pump hale,</v>

3161
02:21:17.911 --> 02:21:21.360
<v Speaker 3>one of the top trump administration </v>
<v Speaker 3>officials because it says they're like a</v>

3162
02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:25.020
<v Speaker 3>nonstate terrorist actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about that.</v>

3163
02:21:25.021 --> 02:21:25.854
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is because basically what they do </v>

3164
02:21:27.451 --> 02:21:30.540
<v Speaker 3>is what discharging reporters should </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3165
02:21:30.541 --> 02:21:31.980
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what the bad guy,</v>

3166
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.903
<v Speaker 3>here's what the people in the government</v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing and this is the stuff that </v>

3167
02:21:34.231 --> 02:21:36.030
<v Speaker 3>they're keeping secret that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't keep secret,</v>

3168
02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:37.140
<v Speaker 3>and our government goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3169
02:21:37.141 --> 02:21:37.980
<v Speaker 3>that's terrorism.</v>

3170
02:21:38.390 --> 02:21:40.640
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when twitter or one of these people,</v>

3171
02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.890
<v Speaker 6>one of these organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bands,</v>

3172
02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:47.720
<v Speaker 6>something like the free thought project,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they make any statements or they just</v>

3173
02:21:47.721 --> 02:21:48.280
<v Speaker 6>remove them</v>

3174
02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:49.113
<v Speaker 3>all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw what was on the Guardian article </v>

3175
02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:51.513
<v Speaker 3>and on the Guardian they said it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>inauthentic behavior was the reason why </v>

3176
02:21:53.981 --> 02:21:54.814
<v Speaker 3>they were pulling them and maybe one or </v>
<v Speaker 3>two other things that I'm forgetting at </v>

3177
02:21:56.441 --> 02:21:56.910
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>

3178
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:59.280
<v Speaker 6>That is a fucking weird statement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

3179
02:21:59.281 --> 02:22:00.920
<v Speaker 6>Authentic behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3180
02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:03.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucked up man,</v>

3181
02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:05.900
<v Speaker 6>because they could just do it to </v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody.</v>

3182
02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.670
<v Speaker 6>That's the point and that's what's so </v>
<v Speaker 6>scary.</v>

3183
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:08.810
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is what scary,</v>

3184
02:22:08.811 --> 02:22:09.644
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that there are private companies and </v>

3185
02:22:12.171 --> 02:22:15.320
<v Speaker 6>these people are allowed to post on them</v>
<v Speaker 6>until they decide they're not allowed to</v>

3186
02:22:15.321 --> 02:22:17.540
<v Speaker 6>post on them because they violate their </v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of service,</v>

3187
02:22:17.810 --> 02:22:22.810
<v Speaker 6>but when your terms of service with are </v>
<v Speaker 6>that open ended inauthentic behavior,</v>

3188
02:22:23.151 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 6>like what the fuck does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

3189
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.813
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They leave the terms of service </v>

3190
02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:29.113
<v Speaker 1>purposefully vague so that they can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with knocking off wherever they </v>

3191
02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:32.364
<v Speaker 1>want to knock off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird that they all agreed </v>

3192
02:22:35.010 --> 02:22:35.843
<v Speaker 1>that facebook agreed and twitter agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would be the incentive of </v>

3193
02:22:38.971 --> 02:22:39.804
<v Speaker 1>twitter to follow suit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it be the incentive smokey back </v>

3194
02:22:42.211 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 1>room given to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to speculate.</v>

3195
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think would be given to them</v>

3196
02:22:48.271 --> 02:22:49.104
<v Speaker 1>that would give them the incentive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to pull a site that's kind of like </v>

3197
02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dorsey guys seems pretty socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive.</v>

3198
02:22:55.050 --> 02:22:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I think they are meeting just like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

3199
02:22:57.991 --> 02:22:58.824
<v Speaker 1>we know they did this with Israel where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled down pro Palestinian human </v>

3200
02:23:01.411 --> 02:23:04.770
<v Speaker 1>rights pages to allow facebook to </v>
<v Speaker 1>function in their country.</v>

3201
02:23:04.771 --> 02:23:05.970
<v Speaker 1>They said you have to do x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y,</v>

3202
02:23:05.971 --> 02:23:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and Z dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are meetings with,</v>

3203
02:23:07.921 --> 02:23:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our intelligence agencies,</v>

3204
02:23:10.410 --> 02:23:11.580
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI,</v>

3205
02:23:11.581 --> 02:23:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3206
02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:13.073
<v Speaker 1>Somebody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe CEO's of various corporations </v>

3207
02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:16.830
<v Speaker 1>where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3208
02:23:16.831 --> 02:23:18.720
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are problem.</v>

3209
02:23:18.721 --> 02:23:20.520
<v Speaker 1>These people are problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are a problem.</v>

3210
02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:21.593
<v Speaker 1>Let's do the right thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to hear a contrary </v>

3211
02:23:23.701 --> 02:23:25.290
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3212
02:23:25.291 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know immediately.</v>

3213
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know like what is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the contrary argument?</v>

3214
02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that we're missing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want,</v>

3215
02:23:33.241 --> 02:23:35.850
<v Speaker 1>we could try to find the guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>article and read what they said,</v>

3216
02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:38.640
<v Speaker 1>what twitter said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what twitter and facebook says,</v>

3217
02:23:38.641 --> 02:23:42.360
<v Speaker 1>see if you could find that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the Guardian article.</v>

3218
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not coming up and pulled it off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet guardian.</v>

3219
02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:47.240
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the headline?</v>

3220
02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:48.093
<v Speaker 1>Searched it and went on news and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no articles from the Guardian </v>

3221
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:52.020
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only two.</v>

3222
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:56.310
<v Speaker 1>The only two things I found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only two things I found it on rt and</v>

3223
02:23:56.311 --> 02:23:57.144
<v Speaker 1>the Guardian and nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you didn't hear about it </v>

3224
02:23:59.131 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 1>because mainstream media didn't talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because guess what?</v>

3225
02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:03.870
<v Speaker 1>These outlets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes our competition to mainstream</v>

3226
02:24:03.871 --> 02:24:08.871
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man that is.</v>

3227
02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So the Alex Jones thing is really like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>test run almost pretty much searching on</v>

3228
02:24:16.621 --> 02:24:18.390
<v Speaker 1>their website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Guardian website,</v>

3229
02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:19.253
<v Speaker 1>rethought project that's using google to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it and the top article is something </v>

3230
02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.270
<v Speaker 1>about food in 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when we get off here,</v>

3231
02:24:27.271 --> 02:24:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll do a search and we can see if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could find a statement.</v>

3232
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:30.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we get unfair is not helping </v>

3233
02:24:31.351 --> 02:24:34.720
<v Speaker 1>all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The newest right now they saw it.</v>

3234
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:36.083
<v Speaker 1>They saw the article from the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought project and that says the same </v>

3235
02:24:37.681 --> 02:24:38.514
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't have the exact statement </v>

3236
02:24:39.421 --> 02:24:41.540
<v Speaker 1>from twitter and facebook on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing.</v>

3237
02:24:41.541 --> 02:24:46.100
<v Speaker 1>See if you can just google statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>from twitter that wasn't involved.</v>

3238
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:47.460
<v Speaker 1>The free thought that wasn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

3239
02:24:47.461 --> 02:24:49.140
<v Speaker 1>They just threw it in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

3240
02:24:49.410 --> 02:24:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It was like facebook and twitter purges </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for,</v>

3241
02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an inauthentic </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in the title,</v>

3242
02:24:55.381 --> 02:24:56.214
<v Speaker 1>but it was an article somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you really think that there's some </v>

3243
02:24:58.351 --> 02:25:01.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of smokey back room deals where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

3244
02:25:01.081 --> 02:25:03.930
<v Speaker 1>listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are making tons of money.</v>

3245
02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:06.300
<v Speaker 1>We've got a bit of an issue here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's work through this.</v>

3246
02:25:06.301 --> 02:25:07.134
<v Speaker 1>This is what we want removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are causing us a bunch of </v>

3247
02:25:08.971 --> 02:25:10.740
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3248
02:25:11.310 --> 02:25:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know they did that in Israel.</v>

3249
02:25:13.741 --> 02:25:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I do know that they do that in all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries where the government say,</v>

3250
02:25:16.711 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to function here you have to do</v>

3251
02:25:18.541 --> 02:25:18.931
<v Speaker 1>x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y,</v>

3252
02:25:18.931 --> 02:25:21.360
<v Speaker 1>and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why wouldn't they do that in the US?</v>

3253
02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:23.513
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what groups would want the free </v>

3254
02:25:26.351 --> 02:25:28.960
<v Speaker 1>thought project or police the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>removed?</v>

3255
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta remember a lot of these.</v>

3256
02:25:30.850 --> 02:25:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So the police accountability groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty easy law enforcement.</v>

3257
02:25:33.530 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 1>What would want that removed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3258
02:25:34.661 --> 02:25:35.494
<v Speaker 1>But do you think law enforcement has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of pulled to go to twitter and not </v>

3259
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:38.951
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3260
02:25:38.951 --> 02:25:41.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Police Department in Toledo,</v>

3261
02:25:41.051 --> 02:25:42.850
<v Speaker 1>but if the FBI maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

3262
02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.980
<v Speaker 1>or the CIA or whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major law enforcement,</v>

3263
02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:50.640
<v Speaker 1>general law enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that people kept going to with</v>

3264
02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones was Sandy Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandy Hook.</v>

3265
02:25:52.811 --> 02:25:53.644
<v Speaker 1>He said children didn't get the sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to defend Alex Jones on </v>

3266
02:25:56.381 --> 02:25:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the merits of that point because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead wrong.</v>

3267
02:25:58.151 --> 02:25:58.984
<v Speaker 1>On that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're descending is the principle </v>

3268
02:26:00.430 --> 02:26:02.380
<v Speaker 1>of letting somebody speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3269
02:26:02.381 --> 02:26:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

3270
02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.870
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is there's no thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to on this,</v>

3271
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:10.450
<v Speaker 1>so it's like there's already been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precedent set.</v>

3272
02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:11.830
<v Speaker 1>They could just remove people.</v>

3273
02:26:12.250 --> 02:26:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So they removed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got this here.</v>

3274
02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:16.130
<v Speaker 1>It got sloppier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3275
02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Well it got more clandestine because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

3276
02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:22.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no big smoking gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no nothing.</v>

3277
02:26:22.811 --> 02:26:24.550
<v Speaker 1>It's just all of a sudden the yanked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3278
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:27.550
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3279
02:26:27.610 --> 02:26:30.730
<v Speaker 1>no major mainstream media outlet in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US reported on it.</v>

3280
02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Our is Russia today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's got exact article.</v>

3281
02:26:34.170 --> 02:26:35.003
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this image of all media by </v>

3282
02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:41.821
<v Speaker 1>facebook is pushing back just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning censorship in state.</v>

3283
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:44.200
<v Speaker 1>They may cite the Guardian article in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this article.</v>

3284
02:26:44.310 --> 02:26:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I was looking more about because I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>this article that came out,</v>

3285
02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:52.960
<v Speaker 1>it's us pushing back today from today.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So people were starting to catch onto </v>

3290
02:27:02.171 --> 02:27:04.420

<v Speaker 6>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The latest appearance of an apparent </v>

3292
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:08.623
<v Speaker 6>censorship of political speech online us</v>
<v Speaker 6>based tech giants this month shut down </v>

3293
02:27:12.401 --> 02:27:14.830
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of user accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some belonged to wells to abis.</v>

3294
02:27:14.831 --> 02:27:17.590
<v Speaker 6>Alternative media outlets with hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 6>of thousands of followers,</v>

3295
02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:18.873
<v Speaker 6>like the free thought project or </v>
<v Speaker 6>anti-media senior fellow with German </v>

3296
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:23.343
<v Speaker 6>Marshall Fund leading think tank,</v>
<v Speaker 6>advocating us global supremacy seems to </v>

3297
02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:30.550
<v Speaker 6>have at least partially taking credit </v>
<v Speaker 6>for this.</v>

3298
02:27:30.890 --> 02:27:32.350
<v Speaker 6>It says in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Russia,</v>

3299
02:27:32.351 --> 02:27:33.184
<v Speaker 6>China,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and other foreign states take advantage </v>

3300
02:27:34.991 --> 02:27:37.390
<v Speaker 6>of our open political system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

3301
02:27:37.391 --> 02:27:38.224
<v Speaker 6>Fly set.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can invent stories that got </v>

3302
02:27:40.421 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 6>repeated and spread through different </v>
<v Speaker 6>sites.</v>

3303
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:46.960
<v Speaker 6>So we are just starting to push back </v>
<v Speaker 6>just this last week,</v>

3304
02:27:46.961 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 6>facebook became began starting to take </v>
<v Speaker 6>down sites.</v>

3305
02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:53.590
<v Speaker 6>So this is just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3306
02:27:53.591 --> 02:27:58.591
<v Speaker 6>So what they're saying is that these </v>
<v Speaker 6>websites have been infiltrated by people</v>

3307
02:27:59.141 --> 02:28:01.450
<v Speaker 6>from China and Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that what they're saying?</v>

3308
02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:05.640
<v Speaker 6>But scroll back up again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>please stop.</v>

3309
02:28:05.970 --> 02:28:06.803
<v Speaker 6>It said China and other foreign states </v>
<v Speaker 6>take advantage of our open political </v>

3310
02:28:09.541 --> 02:28:10.620
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Russia,</v>

3311
02:28:10.621 --> 02:28:11.454
<v Speaker 6>China.</v>

3312
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:12.403
<v Speaker 1>So that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is somebody from the German </v>

3313
02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a leading think tank,</v>

3314
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:16.743
<v Speaker 1>advocating us interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that because we're so scared of </v>

3315
02:28:18.881 --> 02:28:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>

3316
02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian and Chinese infiltration.</v>

3317
02:28:22.521 --> 02:28:24.020
<v Speaker 1>That's why we got to pull down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

3318
02:28:24.021 --> 02:28:24.501
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3319
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:25.334
<v Speaker 1>maybe these accounts like the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought project are run by people who </v>

3320
02:28:26.991 --> 02:28:29.570
<v Speaker 1>are trying to destroy America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to pull them down.</v>

3321
02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:30.493
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's beyond a preposterous </v>

3322
02:28:32.091 --> 02:28:33.320
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they're saying.</v>

3323
02:28:33.321 --> 02:28:34.154
<v Speaker 1>They're saying they can invent stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get repeated in spread through </v>

3324
02:28:36.741 --> 02:28:39.740
<v Speaker 1>different sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just starting to push back just</v>

3325
02:28:39.741 --> 02:28:42.110
<v Speaker 1>this last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook again started take downsides to</v>

3326
02:28:42.111 --> 02:28:42.944
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the beginning.</v>

3327
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.903
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're blaming the influence of Russia </v>

3328
02:28:46.371 --> 02:28:47.204
<v Speaker 1>and China and that they're saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is their excuse for taking down </v>

3329
02:28:50.751 --> 02:28:55.040
<v Speaker 1>these pages because these pages are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being compromised by foreign agents.</v>

3330
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:56.780
<v Speaker 1>It's the oldest trick in the book to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3331
02:28:56.781 --> 02:28:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these foreign entities or sowing discord</v>

3332
02:28:59.421 --> 02:29:00.254
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so therefore we're not going to allow </v>

3333
02:29:01.941 --> 02:29:03.410
<v Speaker 1>this dialogue to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3334
02:29:03.411 --> 02:29:04.244
<v Speaker 1>I remember they blamed Russia for black </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives matter facebook pages during the </v>

3335
02:29:07.731 --> 02:29:08.564
<v Speaker 1>2016 election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's fucked up about this is </v>

3336
02:29:10.251 --> 02:29:12.120
<v Speaker 1>there's not even any smoking gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

3337
02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:14.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just say it,</v>

3338
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:15.703
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

3339
02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:18.470
<v Speaker 1>but they're not even pointing to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific example.</v>

3340
02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:19.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

3341
02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Any example where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3342
02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:22.093
<v Speaker 1>you're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down and see if there's anything </v>

3343
02:29:24.891 --> 02:29:26.780
<v Speaker 1>in this that makes any sense.</v>

3344
02:29:28.010 --> 02:29:28.843
<v Speaker 1>According to the account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying complained that any person with </v>

3345
02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:32.114
<v Speaker 1>an email and set up an account on social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media and potentially reach a wide </v>

3346
02:29:35.151 --> 02:29:38.990
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're predicting a long global struggle</v>

3347
02:29:38.991 --> 02:29:42.920
<v Speaker 1>to fix the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3348
02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

3349
02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:44.953
<v Speaker 1>He started his career as the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>political circles as an advisor to </v>

3350
02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:50.450
<v Speaker 1>George W dot Bush administration is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always trust those people.</v>

3351
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:51.463
<v Speaker 1>Also a foreign policy and national </v>
<v Speaker 1>security consultant for this Senator </v>

3352
02:29:55.011 --> 02:29:55.844
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the geniuses who should </v>

3353
02:29:58.311 --> 02:29:59.580
<v Speaker 1>regulate the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3354
02:29:59.870 --> 02:30:02.810
<v Speaker 1>These guys who've been wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything reliably.</v>

3355
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>

3356
02:30:03.801 --> 02:30:05.210
<v Speaker 1>if you could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3357
02:30:05.211 --> 02:30:09.200
<v Speaker 1>the Russians have influenced this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians are a part of this,</v>

3358
02:30:09.201 --> 02:30:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3359
02:30:10.881 --> 02:30:11.714
<v Speaker 1>pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hacky and it's partisan and it </v>

3360
02:30:13.491 --> 02:30:15.740
<v Speaker 1>actually works for on the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3361
02:30:15.741 --> 02:30:16.574
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it works on Corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and people who want to blame </v>

3362
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's election loss on the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it works on you that played that.</v>

3363
02:30:22.491 --> 02:30:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear him talk because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of it.</v>

3364
02:30:28.090 --> 02:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Can I go to the bathroom real quick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right back</v>

3365
02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:34.413
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>

3366
02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:35.393
<v Speaker 2>Principles values as one of our greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>strengths and therefore one of the best </v>

3367
02:30:38.971 --> 02:30:39.804
<v Speaker 2>ways to weaken us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that that's one of the key </v>

3368
02:30:42.721 --> 02:30:47.160
<v Speaker 2>things to understand here is Putin's </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting actually out of weakness and why</v>

3369
02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:48.153
<v Speaker 1>we jamie not come to understand or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least the consciousness in this country </v>

3370
02:30:51.491 --> 02:30:53.510
<v Speaker 1>does not necessarily view Putin</v>

3371
02:30:54.090 --> 02:30:54.923
<v Speaker 2>aligned with other strong men figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been a long running problem in </v>

3372
02:30:59.011 --> 02:30:59.844
<v Speaker 2>American foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not just a problem that started </v>

3373
02:31:02.041 --> 02:31:05.670
<v Speaker 2>with President Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I served in the Bush administration.</v>

3374
02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:06.533
<v Speaker 2>President George W dot Bush tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>form a relationship with Vladimir Putin </v>

3375
02:31:10.201 --> 02:31:13.560
<v Speaker 2>to get certain things to advance us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Security.</v>

3376
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:17.370
<v Speaker 2>President Obama tried the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with is reset of Russian,</v>

3377
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:18.283
<v Speaker 2>a US Russian relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not unusual that you have an </v>

3378
02:31:21.661 --> 02:31:22.494
<v Speaker 2>administration that maybe doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily view Russia as the threat </v>

3379
02:31:25.591 --> 02:31:27.030
<v Speaker 2>that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3380
02:31:27.031 --> 02:31:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I think the politics of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public opinion right now,</v>

3381
02:31:30.361 --> 02:31:31.194
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually seen a shift over the last </v>

3382
02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:35.003
<v Speaker 2>several years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More Democrats now actually I think </v>

3383
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:38.850
<v Speaker 2>actually view Russia and Putin as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>

3384
02:31:39.430 --> 02:31:41.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to where they were still here.</v>

3385
02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:44.860
<v Speaker 6>But boy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this gives you,</v>

3386
02:31:45.020 --> 02:31:47.060
<v Speaker 6>it just leaves a bad taste in your </v>
<v Speaker 6>mouth,</v>

3387
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:52.630
<v Speaker 6>is the idea that these people are just </v>
<v Speaker 6>deciding to remove pages and there going</v>

3388
02:31:55.771 --> 02:31:56.604
<v Speaker 6>on television giving these interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying that it's because of Russia and </v>

3389
02:31:59.341 --> 02:32:03.160
<v Speaker 6>Putin without any evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3390
02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:07.150
<v Speaker 6>so maybe they didn't share the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to say something,</v>

3391
02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:08.200
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3392
02:32:08.201 --> 02:32:10.930
<v Speaker 6>if you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you believe in a free society and you</v>

3393
02:32:10.931 --> 02:32:11.764
<v Speaker 6>believe in freedom of speech and freedom</v>
<v Speaker 6>of expression and you censorship censor </v>

3394
02:32:15.101 --> 02:32:16.480
<v Speaker 6>people are shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bro,</v>

3395
02:32:16.481 --> 02:32:17.380
<v Speaker 6>what's going on here?</v>

3396
02:32:17.430 --> 02:32:19.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would only go with that.</v>

3397
02:32:19.250 --> 02:32:20.370
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3398
02:32:20.610 --> 02:32:21.690
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

3399
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:24.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's something that they don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix for the,</v>

3400
02:32:24.430 --> 02:32:26.880
<v Speaker 3>for the way that it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you show the evidence,</v>

3401
02:32:26.881 --> 02:32:27.714
<v Speaker 3>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're literally showing the criminals </v>

3402
02:32:29.101 --> 02:32:29.934
<v Speaker 3>how to how to do this and it could just </v>
<v Speaker 3>run more rampant and they got to plug </v>

3403
02:32:32.851 --> 02:32:33.490
<v Speaker 3>more holes.</v>

3404
02:32:33.490 --> 02:32:36.580
<v Speaker 6>Well that would be the devil's advocate </v>
<v Speaker 6>position,</v>

3405
02:32:36.581 --> 02:32:37.414
<v Speaker 6>but in order to take people down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing is if they're doing it and no </v>

3406
02:32:42.521 --> 02:32:43.690
<v Speaker 6>one's pushing back,</v>

3407
02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:45.793
<v Speaker 6>you're just going to be able to do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>with anybody that disagrees with you or </v>

3408
02:32:47.601 --> 02:32:48.434
<v Speaker 6>anybody that's going to be an impediment</v>
<v Speaker 6>to your political campaign or anyone's </v>

3409
02:32:50.961 --> 02:32:53.240
<v Speaker 6>getting the way of anything you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to push through.</v>

3410
02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:54.793
<v Speaker 6>And then this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a giant issue with people that </v>

3411
02:32:57.561 --> 02:33:00.140
<v Speaker 6>have that kind of power that can </v>
<v Speaker 6>influence facebook or twitter.</v>

3412
02:33:00.440 --> 02:33:02.180
<v Speaker 6>And if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and look,</v>

3413
02:33:02.181 --> 02:33:04.970
<v Speaker 6>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we haven't talked to Zuckerberg,</v>

3414
02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.130
<v Speaker 6>we haven't talked to Jack Dorsey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't know who's,</v>

3415
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:08.323
<v Speaker 6>who's pulling strings or who's asking </v>
<v Speaker 6>them to do things or what evidence they </v>

3416
02:33:10.641 --> 02:33:13.730
<v Speaker 6>presented to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's just very uncomfortable.</v>

3417
02:33:13.731 --> 02:33:18.050
<v Speaker 6>It's very uncomfortable to see that guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking and bringing up Russia and Putin</v>

3418
02:33:18.051 --> 02:33:19.960
<v Speaker 6>because people bring them up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they're the man,</v>

3419
02:33:20.270 --> 02:33:21.103
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what's the brushing poot </v>

3420
02:33:22.270 --> 02:33:22.641
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

3421
02:33:22.641 --> 02:33:23.474
<v Speaker 6>they're interfering with our democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>interfering with our issues here in </v>

3422
02:33:26.211 --> 02:33:27.044
<v Speaker 6>America and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to ruin democracy and bring </v>

3423
02:33:29.331 --> 02:33:30.940
<v Speaker 6>our country down from the inside.</v>

3424
02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:32.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3425
02:33:32.241 --> 02:33:33.074
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet went through a phase of </v>

3426
02:33:34.491 --> 02:33:35.324
<v Speaker 3>like just totally free and open wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild west type thing and now it looks </v>

3427
02:33:39.441 --> 02:33:42.380
<v Speaker 3>like they're trying to reel it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

3428
02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:45.140
<v Speaker 3>that's the viewed as the public square.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be the,</v>

3429
02:33:45.141 --> 02:33:45.974
<v Speaker 3>these social media outlets which are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic and so powerful that this is </v>

3430
02:33:49.071 --> 02:33:52.670
<v Speaker 3>now the public square.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to be able to censor people in these,</v>

3431
02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:55.760
<v Speaker 3>in these forums should be considered </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconstitutional,</v>

3432
02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:58.850
<v Speaker 3>coordinated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inauthentic behavior.</v>

3433
02:33:58.880 --> 02:33:59.451
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you found it.</v>

3434
02:33:59.451 --> 02:34:00.890
<v Speaker 3>You found articles spamming</v>

3435
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.903
<v Speaker 7>hm,</v>

3436
02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:06.300
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the like the websites that they actually</v>

3437
02:34:06.301 --> 02:34:10.530
<v Speaker 3>pulled down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that totally destroys their argument.</v>

3438
02:34:10.531 --> 02:34:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Even if you buy into the premise that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

3439
02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:14.310
<v Speaker 3>this is a good reason to pull somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3440
02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pages</v>

3441
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.813
<v Speaker 6>they pulled down were so well </v>
<v Speaker 6>established and there are of course not </v>

3442
02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:22.713
<v Speaker 6>inauthentic in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people who are running these pages </v>

3443
02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:25.293
<v Speaker 6>that really deeply care about these </v>
<v Speaker 6>issues and want to get this news out to </v>

3444
02:34:27.371 --> 02:34:29.780
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

3445
02:34:31.350 --> 02:34:32.183
<v Speaker 6>this is a good quote here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Drawing the line between real and </v>

3446
02:34:35.231 --> 02:34:36.064
<v Speaker 6>inauthentic views is a difficult </v>
<v Speaker 6>enterprise that could put everything </v>

3447
02:34:38.261 --> 02:34:39.094
<v Speaker 6>from impartial political parody to </v>
<v Speaker 6>genuine but outlandish views on the </v>

3448
02:34:42.341 --> 02:34:46.720
<v Speaker 6>chopping block and find us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are politicians in the US.</v>

3449
02:34:46.721 --> 02:34:47.554
<v Speaker 6>This happened during the debate between </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ted Cruz and Beta O'rourke all at the </v>

3450
02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:54.340
<v Speaker 6>exact same time with the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 6>hashtags.</v>

3451
02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:57.460
<v Speaker 6>There were pro ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Things tweeted out at once,</v>

3452
02:34:57.610 --> 02:34:58.443
<v Speaker 6>so at that is their bots that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>bought to help Ted Cruz win the </v>

3453
02:35:00.551 --> 02:35:02.410
<v Speaker 6>election.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's election interference.</v>

3454
02:35:02.470 --> 02:35:03.303
<v Speaker 6>That's inauthentic behavior and nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about pulling down those </v>

3455
02:35:05.771 --> 02:35:07.990
<v Speaker 6>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at what it says here in a statement</v>

3456
02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:09.190
<v Speaker 6>posted online newsroom.</v>

3457
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:12.640
<v Speaker 6>Facebook says it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>purge those pages because they're owners</v>

3458
02:35:12.641 --> 02:35:13.474
<v Speaker 6>were using fake accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sharing the same content between </v>

3459
02:35:16.151 --> 02:35:19.500
<v Speaker 6>multiple pages and linking to add </v>
<v Speaker 6>supported websites.</v>

3460
02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:24.540
<v Speaker 6>It calls ad farms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so what that doesn't even is that even a</v>

3461
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:26.860
<v Speaker 6>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this is where it gets interesting it</v>

3462
02:35:26.861 --> 02:35:27.694
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what the social network calls spam </v>

3463
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.350
<v Speaker 6>the owners of these pages call standard </v>
<v Speaker 6>procedures for operating on facebook.</v>

3464
02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:37.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was like.</v>

3465
02:35:38.470 --> 02:35:42.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't even think if the argument from </v>
<v Speaker 6>facebook is correct that there really is</v>

3466
02:35:42.311 --> 02:35:44.380
<v Speaker 6>a reason to pull them down and go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It says here,</v>

3467
02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:47.010
<v Speaker 6>nearly all the page owners contact by </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Guardian,</v>

3468
02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:49.930
<v Speaker 6>say they use backup or fake accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

3469
02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:53.800
<v Speaker 6>Along with their real ones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they do it in part to protect themselves</v>

3470
02:35:53.801 --> 02:35:57.610
<v Speaker 6>from being targeted by political </v>
<v Speaker 6>opponents and having their real accounts</v>

3471
02:35:57.700 --> 02:36:01.240
<v Speaker 6>end up in facebook jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Reverse press,</v>

3472
02:36:01.241 --> 02:36:03.850
<v Speaker 6>a left leaning news site whose facebook </v>
<v Speaker 6>page disappear yesterday,</v>

3473
02:36:03.851 --> 02:36:05.440
<v Speaker 6>so this is on the left and the right.</v>

3474
02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:07.900
<v Speaker 6>They're censoring people because you got</v>
<v Speaker 6>snowflakes on the right.</v>

3475
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:09.720
<v Speaker 6>There's another one right wing news that</v>
<v Speaker 6>was pulled down.</v>

3476
02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:10.630
<v Speaker 6>Stop scrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Please,</v>

3477
02:36:10.980 --> 02:36:12.190
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but look at this,</v>

3478
02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:13.053
<v Speaker 6>this is really interesting there w,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they're admitting to disingenuous </v>

3479
02:36:17.381 --> 02:36:18.214
<v Speaker 6>behavior though they're using fake </v>
<v Speaker 6>accounts to protect themselves were </v>

3480
02:36:22.011 --> 02:36:24.890
<v Speaker 6>being targeted by political opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it's,</v>

3481
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:30.270
<v Speaker 6>but that's if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they are violating facebook policy.</v>

3482
02:36:30.370 --> 02:36:31.203
<v Speaker 6>So I've seen this on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know people who have gotten their </v>

3483
02:36:33.041 --> 02:36:33.874
<v Speaker 6>accounts banned on twitter but they </v>
<v Speaker 6>create a new account and they stay on </v>

3484
02:36:35.771 --> 02:36:38.050
<v Speaker 6>twitter and that's technically a </v>
<v Speaker 6>violation of terms of service,</v>

3485
02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 6>but it also is something that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>think is religious at all.</v>

3486
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:42.513
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's a big difference between </v>

3487
02:36:42.821 --> 02:36:44.920
<v Speaker 6>someone getting banned and then starting</v>
<v Speaker 6>a fake,</v>

3488
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:47.310
<v Speaker 6>a second account.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not that they're,</v>

3489
02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.760
<v Speaker 6>they're using multiple accounts at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same time and some of them are fake.</v>

3490
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:52.271
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

3491
02:36:52.271 --> 02:36:53.104
<v Speaker 6>I'm not justifying their being banned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I am saying that they violated </v>

3492
02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.573
<v Speaker 6>certain procedures and they did so in </v>
<v Speaker 6>order to public publicize their ideas </v>

3493
02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:06.010
<v Speaker 6>and they did it to try to make their </v>
<v Speaker 6>ideas more,</v>

3494
02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:09.520
<v Speaker 6>just more project them more have have </v>
<v Speaker 6>more,</v>

3495
02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:11.470
<v Speaker 6>more bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But according to facebook,</v>

3496
02:37:11.471 --> 02:37:12.304
<v Speaker 6>should you not be allowed to have like </v>
<v Speaker 6>three or four accounts where you tweet </v>

3497
02:37:14.501 --> 02:37:15.334
<v Speaker 6>the same stuff or post the same stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it seems like you said though </v>

3498
02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:20.270
<v Speaker 6>what facebook said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you scroll back up to the beginning,</v>

3499
02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:22.510
<v Speaker 6>scroll back up at the beginning please.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's part of the top.</v>

3500
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:24.260
<v Speaker 6>The top,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the top,</v>

3501
02:37:24.261 --> 02:37:25.580
<v Speaker 6>top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See what it says.</v>

3502
02:37:25.581 --> 02:37:28.640
<v Speaker 6>A coordinated inauthentic behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 6>spamming.</v>

3503
02:37:28.641 --> 02:37:29.474
<v Speaker 6>So they were spamming and that does </v>
<v Speaker 6>sound like coordinated inauthentic </v>

3504
02:37:32.601 --> 02:37:35.330
<v Speaker 6>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they have a bunch of alternative fake</v>

3505
02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:40.040
<v Speaker 6>sites and fake pages that they using to </v>
<v Speaker 6>spread their stuff.</v>

3506
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.903
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that they should have </v>

3507
02:37:41.811 --> 02:37:43.520
<v Speaker 6>been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

3508
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:46.550
<v Speaker 6>I think better would be to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

3509
02:37:46.551 --> 02:37:47.384
<v Speaker 6>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to remove these fake pages </v>

3510
02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:55.040
<v Speaker 6>that are publicizing your ideas and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>have your real authentic page.</v>

3511
02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:56.233
<v Speaker 6>But what they're saying is that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're leaking to add farms and that </v>

3512
02:38:00.801 --> 02:38:05.801
<v Speaker 6>they use this to publicize their pages </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that everybody does it.</v>

3513
02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:09.140
<v Speaker 6>Everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to do it.</v>

3514
02:38:09.230 --> 02:38:10.063
<v Speaker 6>So why wouldn't they pulled?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let's say the free thought project </v>

3515
02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:14.810
<v Speaker 6>have three or four other things where </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were posting the same stuff under a</v>

3516
02:38:14.811 --> 02:38:15.644
<v Speaker 6>different name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why would you not pull down to three or </v>

3517
02:38:16.581 --> 02:38:18.680
<v Speaker 6>four other things and leave up to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>free thought project?</v>

3518
02:38:18.681 --> 02:38:19.514
<v Speaker 6>I think they're saying [inaudible] the </v>
<v Speaker 6>free thought project violated their </v>

3519
02:38:21.591 --> 02:38:23.630
<v Speaker 6>terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

3520
02:38:23.631 --> 02:38:24.830
<v Speaker 6>So you don't want them to do that.</v>

3521
02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:25.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

3522
02:38:25.971 --> 02:38:26.804
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would they have pulled the free thought </v>

3523
02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:32.280
<v Speaker 6>project down if they hadn't engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 6>any of these forbidden behaviors?</v>

3524
02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.610
<v Speaker 6>My opinion is I think yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe that's what I think may be,</v>

3525
02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:38.713
<v Speaker 6>but that is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to do that and I'm </v>

3526
02:38:41.721 --> 02:38:44.930
<v Speaker 6>not saying that they should be pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they shouldn't be pulled,</v>

3527
02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:50.000
<v Speaker 6>but maybe they thought this is what they</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to do to get the word out and maybe</v>

3528
02:38:50.001 --> 02:38:50.990
<v Speaker 6>facebook is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

3529
02:38:50.991 --> 02:38:51.824
<v Speaker 6>you fucks are spamming and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're linking to these ad farms and </v>

3530
02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:57.283
<v Speaker 6>these ad farms have been known to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>influenced by Russia and China and all </v>

3531
02:39:01.611 --> 02:39:02.444
<v Speaker 6>these other organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're doing it just to promote your </v>

3532
02:39:04.281 --> 02:39:05.114
<v Speaker 6>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But we're saying that we can't allow </v>

3533
02:39:06.711 --> 02:39:07.544
<v Speaker 6>that kind of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just strikes me as very strange that </v>

3534
02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:11.204
<v Speaker 6>when you have examples like the one I </v>
<v Speaker 6>just gave were maturing the ted Cruz </v>

3535
02:39:14.241 --> 02:39:15.200
<v Speaker 6>Beto O'Rourke debate.</v>

3536
02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:17.780
<v Speaker 6>They all tweeted the same thing at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same time.</v>

3537
02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 6>It was obviously paid for by some right </v>
<v Speaker 6>wing think tank.</v>

3538
02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:22.430
<v Speaker 6>You never hear the story of something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

3539
02:39:22.431 --> 02:39:24.740
<v Speaker 6>If it's benefiting us politician or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

3540
02:39:24.741 --> 02:39:25.574
<v Speaker 6>Like when Mitt Romney bought like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>million fake followers on twitter and </v>

3541
02:39:27.501 --> 02:39:29.720
<v Speaker 6>the 2012 election,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you never hear about like,</v>

3542
02:39:29.721 --> 02:39:31.010
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we targeted that.</v>

3543
02:39:31.011 --> 02:39:31.850
<v Speaker 6>It's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3544
02:39:31.851 --> 02:39:34.430
<v Speaker 6>it just happens to be these independent </v>
<v Speaker 6>alternative media outlets.</v>

3545
02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:35.264
<v Speaker 6>They're spreading the information that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the government doesn't want people to </v>

3546
02:39:37.251 --> 02:39:37.911
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3547
02:39:37.911 --> 02:39:39.950
<v Speaker 6>it could be that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>

3548
02:39:39.951 --> 02:39:42.020
<v Speaker 6>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody does this.</v>

3549
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.883
<v Speaker 6>We're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they're saying we don't like them </v>

3550
02:39:44.301 --> 02:39:45.260
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3551
02:39:45.261 --> 02:39:47.600
<v Speaker 6>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we caught them doing something we.</v>

3552
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:49.350
<v Speaker 6>We don't allow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3553
02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:52.040
<v Speaker 6>let's sweep them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's possible.</v>

3554
02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:53.053
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible that they wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>been removed if they hadn't done this </v>

3555
02:39:56.241 --> 02:39:57.530
<v Speaker 6>shit than not supposed to do?</v>

3556
02:39:58.100 --> 02:39:59.720
<v Speaker 6>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it's likely.</v>

3557
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:01.670
<v Speaker 6>I don't know though because here's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

3558
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:02.803
<v Speaker 6>how look if it's only people who've </v>
<v Speaker 6>engaged in these forbidden behaviors </v>

3559
02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:11.510
<v Speaker 6>that get removed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then facebook has a very good argument,</v>

3560
02:40:11.511 --> 02:40:12.344
<v Speaker 6>but if facebook is saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then people were removed who are </v>

3561
02:40:14.851 --> 02:40:18.030
<v Speaker 6>straight above board doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>the right way,</v>

3562
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.983
<v Speaker 6>just have their own page posted </v>
<v Speaker 6>information on their own page and they </v>

3563
02:40:21.391 --> 02:40:22.224
<v Speaker 6>were never removed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But these are all political and </v>

3564
02:40:24.061 --> 02:40:26.790
<v Speaker 6>alternative media which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they were targeted.</v>

3565
02:40:26.820 --> 02:40:27.510
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>

3566
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:30.270
<v Speaker 6>So they're targeted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in the targeting them,</v>

3567
02:40:30.271 --> 02:40:31.104
<v Speaker 6>they found a bunch of shit that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not supposed to do and that's what got </v>

3568
02:40:33.001 --> 02:40:33.834
<v Speaker 6>them removed.</v>

3569
02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:38.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that there is a good argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>that facebook could make,</v>

3570
02:40:38.711 --> 02:40:41.530
<v Speaker 3>which is very much a nuance troll terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of service argument,</v>

3571
02:40:41.531 --> 02:40:42.364
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's more of a veneer or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>facade than the real heart of why they </v>

3572
02:40:45.521 --> 02:40:46.450
<v Speaker 3>did what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

3573
02:40:46.510 --> 02:40:48.730
<v Speaker 3>that's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not stating that as a fact.</v>

3574
02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:49.780
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3575
02:40:49.781 --> 02:40:53.800
<v Speaker 6>surely what they should have done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially given the popularity of these</v>

3576
02:40:53.801 --> 02:40:56.410
<v Speaker 6>sites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is warn them and say,</v>

3577
02:40:56.411 --> 02:40:59.530
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got to stop doing this because if</v>

3578
02:40:59.531 --> 02:41:01.930
<v Speaker 6>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are going to remove you.</v>

3579
02:41:01.931 --> 02:41:02.764
<v Speaker 6>You were violating our terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You are linking to add farms and you </v>

3580
02:41:06.071 --> 02:41:09.940
<v Speaker 6>have posted from multiple fake accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stopped doing that.</v>

3581
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:12.910
<v Speaker 6>Just use your one authentic account.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We support free speech.</v>

3582
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:14.200
<v Speaker 6>That's what we both like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3583
02:41:14.201 --> 02:41:15.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

3584
02:41:15.550 --> 02:41:16.383
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it could be also that they feel </v>

3585
02:41:17.261 --> 02:41:19.600
<v Speaker 6>like the right wing sites do this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to do this too.</v>

3586
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:22.990
<v Speaker 6>This is how people do it in 2018 is how </v>
<v Speaker 6>you really get the word out.</v>

3587
02:41:23.790 --> 02:41:24.530
<v Speaker 6>That true.</v>

3588
02:41:24.530 --> 02:41:25.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3589
02:41:25.450 --> 02:41:26.283
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've found it interesting that it was </v>

3590
02:41:28.011 --> 02:41:31.310
<v Speaker 3>all alternative media and political </v>
<v Speaker 3>accounts and or left.</v>

3591
02:41:31.311 --> 02:41:32.144
<v Speaker 3>It was just the main thing that seemed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the connecting tissue through it </v>

3592
02:41:35.031 --> 02:41:40.031
<v Speaker 3>all was relatively antiestablishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gross.</v>

3593
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:42.450
<v Speaker 3>It is gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3594
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Have you been following what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Iran at all?</v>

3595
02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:46.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>

3596
02:41:46.490 --> 02:41:49.520
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of ramping up of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tensions now.</v>

3597
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:51.650
<v Speaker 3>So of course we pulled out of the Iran </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal,</v>

3598
02:41:51.651 --> 02:41:53.290
<v Speaker 3>the nuclear deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3599
02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:54.493
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was a good idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>because according to the IAEA </v>

3600
02:41:56.961 --> 02:42:00.650
<v Speaker 3>International Atomic Energy Agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they verified that six different times.</v>

3601
02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Iran was following that deal and trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled out of it.</v>

3602
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.890
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hurt are,</v>

3603
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:08.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diplomatic talks,</v>

3604
02:42:08.631 --> 02:42:09.464
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this story broke a few weeks </v>

3605
02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.120
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the International Criminal Court.</v>

3606
02:42:14.121 --> 02:42:14.954
<v Speaker 3>So Iran sued theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s and according to the International </v>

3607
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:19.881
<v Speaker 3>Criminal Court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

3608
02:42:19.881 --> 02:42:20.571
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't,</v>

3609
02:42:20.571 --> 02:42:24.230
<v Speaker 3>we're not allowed to sanction them when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they allow in humanitarian goods.</v>

3610
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:28.310
<v Speaker 3>So our response to that was to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck off International Criminal Court.</v>

3611
02:42:28.311 --> 02:42:30.110
<v Speaker 3>We're not pulling out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>International Criminal Court.</v>

3612
02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:33.500
<v Speaker 3>So talks about basically totally broken </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3613
02:42:33.501 --> 02:42:35.490
<v Speaker 3>And now the fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3614
02:42:36.170 --> 02:42:39.230
<v Speaker 3>that we could be on the road to war </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we have neo-con John Bolton,</v>

3615
02:42:39.231 --> 02:42:41.720
<v Speaker 3>who's in the trump administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has always wanted a war with Iran.</v>

3616
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:44.030
<v Speaker 3>We have Mike Pompeo who also wants war </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Iran.</v>

3617
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:45.950
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3618
02:42:46.010 --> 02:42:46.843
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good situation because we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pretty solid deal there and now it's </v>

3619
02:42:50.181 --> 02:42:52.310
<v Speaker 3>more likely Iran gets a new if they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3620
02:42:52.810 --> 02:42:53.643
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the tensions are ramping up and if </v>

3621
02:42:55.101 --> 02:42:55.934
<v Speaker 3>they blocked it because Iran is </v>
<v Speaker 3>economies imploding right now and if we </v>

3622
02:42:59.211 --> 02:43:02.510
<v Speaker 3>block their oil exports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you know that we're about to</v>

3623
02:43:02.511 --> 02:43:04.310
<v Speaker 3>do some sort of regime change action </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>

3624
02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:07.180
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to end this unfortunately.</v>

3625
02:43:07.181 --> 02:43:09.280
<v Speaker 6>Do you have anything happy to say before</v>
<v Speaker 6>we wrap this up?</v>

3626
02:43:09.370 --> 02:43:10.203
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
