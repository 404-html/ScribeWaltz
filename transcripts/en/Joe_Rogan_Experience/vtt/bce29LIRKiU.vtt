<v Speaker 1>You tell people what it is?</v>

13
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.693

14
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tease it a little bit.</v>

15
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marketing department I guess has to </v>

16
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>approve everything that's said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.883
<v Speaker 1>it started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be on the discovery </v>

18
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:32.474
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a science channel and it was </v>

19
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:35.624
<v Speaker 1>starting to main filming in February and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll should be finished by the end of </v>

20
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So standby.</v>

21
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's started with a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

22
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.083
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden budgets in the Defense </v>

23
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dark art stuff.</v>

24
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

25
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>The show's going to be called black </v>
<v Speaker 1>files.</v>

26
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the UFO type shit.</v>

27
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be some of that,</v>

28
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.441
<v Speaker 1>a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

29
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>but from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>not from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>did they lie land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they not?</v>

32
00:00:59.331 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

33
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>well really actually kind of tearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

34
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the programs that were funded </v>

35
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>hidden money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>in the Defense Department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do they do that?</v>

38
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you take like the CIA for </v>

39
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the agency's budget is hidden inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hidden,</v>

41
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's placed inside the Defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>Department and it's,</v>

42
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's classified piece of information</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

43
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of the defense department </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a certain budget.</v>

44
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>The CIA gets a piece of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's allowed to know how much or</v>

45
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>where it's spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

46
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese,</v>

48
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>whomever would like to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>how much money is a sent over to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agency so that they can get a sense of a</v>

50
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

51
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

52
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's where the,</v>

53
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>the show concept started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:43.394
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that money spent on both in </v>

55
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the old days and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

56
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of spans,</v>

57
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical operations and events and </v>

58
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:51.974
<v Speaker 1>activities and special units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it comes up to the present time and </v>

59
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>money being devoted now for new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology or new programs,</v>

62
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>new operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new intelligence,</v>

63
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>gathering efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it might be.</v>

64
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of promise,</v>

66
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully people tune in and find that </v>

67
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>well people are always curious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the money goes.</v>

69
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

70
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am like,</v>

71
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>who oversees it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets,</v>

72
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>who gets to decide like what gets spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what and how much money goes where.</v>

73
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And I do actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

74
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my job.</v>

75
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

76
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.851
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:26.684
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people would be </v>

78
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>surprised at the amount that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

79
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

80
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the intelligence community is also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military obviously.</v>

81
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you discuss the actual numbers or </v>

82
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>could you discuss the numbers that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to have a,</v>

83
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to discuss the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that went into past operations,</v>

84
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>but anything that's currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified,</v>

85
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:45.854
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's not going to touch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've been working hard and the has </v>

86
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>been working very hard to get excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

87
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where possible and get cooperation where</v>

88
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:55.670
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a fairly immersive </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>

90
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's the benefit of the even </v>
<v Speaker 1>divulging any of this information.</v>

91
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Like why would they cooperate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they say,</v>

92
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>

93
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

94
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.001
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

95
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:05.834
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frankly they should and they have </v>

96
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>and they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not necessarily with the agency,</v>

97
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>but with other departments.</v>

98
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.923
<v Speaker 1>And certainly within the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some information out there </v>

99
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.784
<v Speaker 1>that's accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some ability to get them to </v>

100
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>cooperate on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on certain,</v>

101
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.254
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>declassified operations that just </v>

102
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>haven't come to light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look a lot of Shit's been declassified</v>

103
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>over the years that's just never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at or talked about.</v>

104
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody maybe gets a wild hair up their</v>

105
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>ass and this is says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look into this program.</v>

106
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And then they start peeling it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's classified,</v>

107
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>it's just nobody's ever bothered to dig </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that information,</v>

108
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>wants it is a declassified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

109
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

110
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of travel,</v>

111
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some great people working on the </v>

112
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

113
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently I have to,</v>

114
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:48.994
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it pretty much at that until the </v>

115
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>marketing department says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

116
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:52.684
<v Speaker 1>here's what you can say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eventually you'll be able to spill </v>

117
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>the beans and tell us everything.</v>

118
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if they're making something like</v>

119
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>the b 52,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they're making a stealth bomber,</v>

120
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>if they're making some spaceship looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

121
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.743
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking to this insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money in research and </v>

122
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.104
<v Speaker 1>development and the budget of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and they have to keep all that </v>

123
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>under wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.981
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

126
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you go back to the old days of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

127
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>of the youtube program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to program was developed,</v>

128
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it designed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>

129
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flown by the CIA all those years ago.</v>

130
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.853
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a massive effort and a lot of </v>

131
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>money and it was done under budget and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was done on time.</v>

132
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part because I think,</v>

133
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were a little bit easier back </v>

134
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>then and we weren't all pissing on each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other up on Capitol Hill Been,</v>

135
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

136
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:40.174
<v Speaker 1>there's so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

137
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.163
<v Speaker 1>it's programs like that that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>will surprise people when they find out </v>

138
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>both who was running it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was responsible.</v>

139
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the degree possible,</v>

140
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did it cost us and you know,</v>

141
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.913
<v Speaker 1>who was involved and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to what degree did it lead to </v>

142
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>something else that we're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

143
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

144
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>threads to pull on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be a lot of,</v>

146
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.453
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's constantly projects that are </v>

147
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>in development that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the people that need to know,</v>

148
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.830
<v Speaker 1>the general public has no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's always the,</v>

149
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purse,</v>

150
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the people on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks like myself,</v>

151
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd go,</v>

152
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we kind of,</v>

153
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Shit they have that they don't tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like that's what you always want.</v>

154
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of invisibility cloak,</v>

155
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>what kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>that would be good if dark matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

157
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.470
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

158
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no it's it and it's,</v>

159
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.033
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get these incredibly smart </v>

160
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>people and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comes down to it.</v>

161
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as as somebody gets an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

162
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:36.904
<v Speaker 1>they're sitting around a table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not unlike going out with your </v>

163
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:39.184
<v Speaker 1>buddies and drinking and thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come with somebody comes up with </v>

164
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>some dumb ass idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you know it,</v>

165
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a TV show or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

166
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

167
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.353
<v Speaker 1>it's not unlike that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of smart guys sitting around a </v>

168
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>table thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's the problem.</v>

169
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>How do we resolve it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the key is to do it creatively,</v>

170
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:55.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come up with it.</v>

171
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you get a bunch of engineers </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a table,</v>

172
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.783
<v Speaker 1>you hope that they're not at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching it from the same point of </v>

173
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.300
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

174
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like with an operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got that,</v>

175
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>you've got a high value target out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to figure out how to get,</v>

176
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>get access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to them.</v>

177
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>You want ideas coming in from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

178
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>so you don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to squelch creativity.</v>

179
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.503
<v Speaker 1>And believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Intel community and the </v>

180
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.444
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been enormously creative over </v>

181
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.324
<v Speaker 1>the years in developing new technologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and developing operational ideas and </v>

182
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.034
<v Speaker 1>methodologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's what we're trying to do is shed </v>

183
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>some light on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's a certain</v>

185
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.650
<v Speaker 2>no amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to use the word fun,</v>

186
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.203
<v Speaker 2>but that's really the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some of it's gotta be fun to </v>

187
00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:36.964
<v Speaker 2>develop this stuff and implement it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and get bad guys with it and to </v>

188
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:40.954
<v Speaker 2>see your project come to fruition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually have a positive effect on the </v>

189
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

190
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.401
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

191
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is,</v>

192
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that simply because you know,</v>

193
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.910
<v Speaker 1>an operations anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you engage in something out there in,</v>

195
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.490
<v Speaker 1>in some place around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it may be.</v>

196
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize as you're walking away that,</v>

197
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not a lot of people doing this </v>

198
00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>at this moment on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

199
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:04.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

200
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:05.464
<v Speaker 1>so the operational activity itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormously entertaining as long as it </v>

201
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 1>goes right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

202
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.133
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all that homework that gets you </v>

203
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:13.661
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that takedown and bin Laden.</v>

205
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.383
<v Speaker 1>We didn't just happen to get lucky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock up on his doorstep right in the </v>

206
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.274
<v Speaker 1>bottom bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was eight or nine years of fucking </v>

207
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:22.930
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

208
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.823
<v Speaker 1>Heavy lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing down countless bad leads and </v>

209
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>doing enormous amounts of surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>street work and tracking down assets and</v>

210
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.550
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just it just the hard,</v>

211
00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:36.730
<v Speaker 1>hard work that eventually allowed the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 1>all those guys from the teams to land </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do their job.</v>

213
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.233
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting to me too is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who was writing the book about all </v>

214
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 2>this stuff and talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>the man who shot bin Ladin Dot guy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>persona non grata in the community.</v>

216
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Like you talked to the other seals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

217
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't do that right now.</v>

218
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

219
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.753
<v Speaker 2>you don't write books about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't talk about that and do it for </v>

220
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 2>a short term gain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

221
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:06.580
<v Speaker 2>you make some profit off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you lose the brothership,</v>

222
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 1>you lose a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

223
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.194
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

224
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.333
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of on the outs in the club </v>

225
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say this,</v>

226
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.860
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

227
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the Horse got out of the barn on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that whole issue of,</v>

228
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:18.394
<v Speaker 1>of guys writing books or getting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and talking about specific </v>

229
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:26.191
<v Speaker 1>operations is because senior commanders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and end senior people,</v>

230
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.363
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that came out of the top levels </v>

231
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:29.500
<v Speaker 1>of government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.840
<v Speaker 1>started writing their memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.610
<v Speaker 1>started revisiting history while they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

234
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>it was their watch and coming up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:40.990
<v Speaker 1>their explanations for history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think all the guys below,</v>

236
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>junior ranks and street level operators,</v>

237
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>they looked at that and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

238
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can do it,</v>

239
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.433
<v Speaker 1>why not me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because you've gotta set the tone </v>

240
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:51.040
<v Speaker 1>from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where it got it.</v>

241
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Got All know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of sideways.</v>

242
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Plus when you have someone who you has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy</v>

243
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 2>story like Marcus Luttrell and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes an amazing movie.</v>

244
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does help the community,</v>

245
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:02.934
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it gets a bunch of people that </v>

246
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 2>are really interested in becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seal.</v>

247
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>It gets people to appreciate the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unbelievable sacrifice and hard work</v>

248
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.394
<v Speaker 2>that's involved.</v>

249
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

250
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is an upside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

251
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an upside to it,</v>

252
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a fine balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

253
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>What point do you go over that line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're right in the sense that,</v>

254
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd see that with a w whom have with </v>

255
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.360
<v Speaker 1>the FBI or dea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 1>they got out there and put their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbprint on some TV shows,</v>

257
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think it kind of,</v>

258
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>it expanded in part a awareness of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what they do.</v>

259
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it helped their recruitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

260
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>and so the seals are no different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

261
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you sign a piece of paper at the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning that says you're going to keep</v>

263
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:48.891
<v Speaker 1>your Yap shut and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's one thing to come out with from</v>

264
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever unit or whatever team or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever organization and say,</v>

265
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about my time in,</v>

266
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a look at sources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods.</v>

267
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Not Look at operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's more of,</v>

268
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened during my time.</v>

269
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not explaining it very well,</v>

270
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a way you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that without screwing the pooch.</v>

271
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I think the seals got overexposed and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of the guys,</v>

273
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resent that.</v>

274
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

275
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 1>you're right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some upsides</v>

276
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.510
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

277
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.370
<v Speaker 2>there's upside to some of the stores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

278
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I've definitely these upside to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marcus Luttrell store cause it's just so</v>

279
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:27.470
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He question here about it.</v>

280
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.070
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to maintain that honor.</v>

281
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a more important to maintain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bond of silence,</v>

282
00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:39.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you guys,</v>

283
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing something that is probably</v>

284
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.460
<v Speaker 2>one of the most dangerous and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most in terms of special operations,</v>

285
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>one of the most significant in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

286
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.860
<v Speaker 2>in all of military in this country.</v>

287
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.520
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the old school guys,</v>

288
00:10:57.521 --> 00:11:00.160
<v Speaker 1>the old school operators out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teams are definitely like,</v>

289
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

290
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut your pie hole.</v>

291
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newer guys again,</v>

292
00:11:04.211 --> 00:11:05.830
<v Speaker 1>because they came up in a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

293
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.723
<v Speaker 1>I mean information flows all around as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much easier and quicker than it did in </v>

294
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:12.730
<v Speaker 1>the seventies and eighties and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early nineties.</v>

295
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.260
<v Speaker 1>But nowadays people are just used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading everything as soon as it happens</v>

296
00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:19.810
<v Speaker 1>and creates a different mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the younger guys in there,</v>

297
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.630
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily view it the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

298
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Think about it until the Dick Marchenko </v>
<v Speaker 2>books came out.</v>

299
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.860
<v Speaker 2>And those were long time as long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

300
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I really was like,</v>

301
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:31.670
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wear regular clothes.</v>

302
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

303
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I think I was like probably 18 or 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>when those books were out.</v>

304
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

305
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy wear long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they dress like hippies.</v>

306
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:43.580
<v Speaker 2>It just normal and go out and invade,</v>

307
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and fade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

308
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>they invading hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

309
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.661
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

310
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Marchenko was famous for wanting his </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys to get drunk together to before,</v>

311
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 2>like big things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

312
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Well it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that idea of team building,</v>

313
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Camaraderie and however you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

314
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.953
<v Speaker 1>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was that sense that we do it and </v>

315
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>it's off the radar and it's not talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

316
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And we take pride in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

317
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back to the same thing if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

318
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:10.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

319
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Bob Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>by gates writes a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a former director of the agency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant guy,</v>

322
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he writes a book and you know,</v>

323
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and then you get somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Mike Morrell writes a book.</v>

324
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And so from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>inside the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a lot of officers going,</v>

326
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:24.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had,</v>

327
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:25.384
<v Speaker 1>maybe when I get out I'll write a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what I'm doing is pretty damn </v>

328
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no laws against that.</v>

329
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

330
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are [inaudible] and you know,</v>

331
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>anybody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

332
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>reveal sources and methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who,</v>

333
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

334
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 1>who breaks their agreements in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper handling,</v>

335
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 1>which is a lifetime agreement of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of classified information,</v>

336
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be consequences.</v>

337
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes if you're senior enough,</v>

338
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

339
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

340
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you sign a piece of paper at the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

342
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it and on it and I said,</v>

343
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

344
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says keep your Yap Shit.</v>

345
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.423
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to over simplify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it says [inaudible] are being given </v>

346
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.484
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility of handling a </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely sensitive information and </v>

347
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:07.474
<v Speaker 1>information that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if released can easily result in </v>

348
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:11.254
<v Speaker 1>the loss of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's as simple as that </v>

349
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.013
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your obligation is to shut your </v>

350
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:16.894
<v Speaker 1>mouth and not talk about sources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods and things that you know better </v>

351
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>not to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

352
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that kind of the drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>

353
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

354
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 1>of the books and the things that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and the,</v>

355
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.753
<v Speaker 1>and the anonymous sources look at New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times can write a in a tire front </v>

356
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:34.690
<v Speaker 1>page article based on nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous sources nowadays never used to</v>

357
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

358
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

359
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.660
<v Speaker 1>editors would sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

360
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get yourself some </v>

361
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>additional sources and that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss so people can put it in context.</v>

362
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case.</v>

363
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

364
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I think Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

365
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.480
<v Speaker 1>we're part of it is low standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I think lower standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think competition,</v>

367
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the desire to get information </v>

368
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 1>out there quickly because every </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist is now,</v>

369
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.613
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing beat the clock with everybody </v>

370
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:03.980
<v Speaker 1>who's got a smartphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

371
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Fancies themselves a blogger or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist on twitter or whatever.</v>

372
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 1>So they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all doing this.</v>

373
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's just this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.540
<v Speaker 1>That says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

375
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>it reminds me of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a meeting with,</v>

376
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

377
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:19.864
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my company diligence for all your </v>

378
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.893
<v Speaker 1>information and security needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was with a major multinational </v>

379
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:27.034
<v Speaker 1>corporation and I was meeting with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>head of security and some other folks </v>

380
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.533
<v Speaker 1>and they do a lot of work overseas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some very difficult places and the </v>

381
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>competition that they face in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>sectors,</v>

382
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.013
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>

383
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And so we went in there and we thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be great.</v>

384
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things we can do for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in terms of gathering information,</v>

385
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.190
<v Speaker 1>preventing them from making mistakes as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going into a new market.</v>

386
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.860
<v Speaker 1>All of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bottom line was they said,</v>

387
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:49.280
<v Speaker 1>they looked at me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

388
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Competition's so fierce.</v>

389
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we make mistakes,</v>

390
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>we'll clean it up later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were willing to do that.</v>

391
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:57.344
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like acceptable lost credit card </v>

392
00:14:58.581 --> 00:14:59.650
<v Speaker 1>fraud loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

393
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.493
<v Speaker 1>for mastercard or whomever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to accept millions and </v>

394
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:05.280
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of dollars as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable loss for,</v>

395
00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:09.200
<v Speaker 1>for the cost of doing business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a little bit like that.</v>

396
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I think with journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

397
00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to just throw shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and hey,</v>

398
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>if they have to make a retraction fine.</v>

399
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 1>But it compromises the way a person like</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself views the news.</v>

400
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

401
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I hate to quote trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he,</v>

402
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>he's like parents that fake news term </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>

403
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a person who's,</v>

404
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:31.580
<v Speaker 1>or an organization is being accused of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying,</v>

405
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me you should really dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>your i's and cross your t's from then on</v>

406
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:37.641
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

407
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.474
<v Speaker 1>you're being accused of lying by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president and I think irresponsibly </v>

408
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 1>accused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way he does it,</v>

409
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>he does it to avoid questions that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them uncomfortable.</v>

410
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as the president,</v>

411
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think you should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

412
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't point to someone from CNN and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fake news.</v>

413
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.653
<v Speaker 1>Like what does it serves 12 right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It serves no purpose for the press that </v>

414
00:15:56.631 --> 00:15:57.464
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you on a preset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I so much of what this administration </v>

415
00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:00.950
<v Speaker 1>does is a self inflicted wound.</v>

416
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.791
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

417
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>and part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

418
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're just crap at messaging.</v>

419
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:08.810
<v Speaker 1>he just says what's on his mind and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

421
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's got tourettes,</v>

422
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.623
<v Speaker 1>but I think he views it as a strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He views it as a reason why he got </v>

423
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 1>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people out there think,</v>

424
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his,</v>

425
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 1>his base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

426
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the people that are really behind them </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>

427
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I think they view it as part of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>charm as well.</v>

428
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is he does release </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified information sometimes.</v>

429
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had that problem with,</v>

430
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several administrations.</v>

431
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know what to not say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

432
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it again is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

434
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.973
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a laxness that's developed over the </v>

435
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 1>years and I don't know why.</v>

436
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.393
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

437
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

438
00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I think about all the various security </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues we face.</v>

439
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been at war for 17 years,</v>

440
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since nine 11 and all these things that </v>

441
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.394
<v Speaker 1>have been happening to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think that we'd be pretty </v>

442
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 1>buttoned up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now every administration has had its</v>

443
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:56.504
<v Speaker 1>moment where it's let slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whether it was the press secretary </v>

444
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 1>of whether it was somebody rushing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podium,</v>

445
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 1>it was somebody on Capitol Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

446
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 1>they're famous for it up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 1>congressmen and congresswomen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>senators all in the,</v>

448
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:07.630
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

449
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 1>in a rush to get in front of the camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about something and then,</v>

450
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit happens.</v>

451
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out that they shouldn't.</v>

452
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:14.024
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all kind of contributes to this </v>

453
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>mentality that we started off talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with,</v>

454
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:20.920
<v Speaker 1>with the seals were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.213
<v Speaker 1>why are we in this point where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are writing books and maybe getting </v>

456
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>outside the box?</v>

457
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

458
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it's this constant drip and lowering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards like you mentioned,</v>

459
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>

460
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we walk that dog bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

461
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just the way it is now,</v>

462
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.443
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the agency anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure you stay tight with people </v>

463
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:40.420
<v Speaker 1>that are still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

464
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>what is the attitude now with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration?</v>

465
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:49.241
<v Speaker 1>Like what they're doing with like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he attacks the FBI and way,</v>

466
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems,</v>

467
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 1>it seems so reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

468
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

469
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

470
00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

471
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the way I feel,</v>

472
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't vote for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president.</v>

473
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:03.564
<v Speaker 1>I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think either of them than the best we </v>

474
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 1>could do when a country of over 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

475
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:11.004
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was you or I that did what </v>

476
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Hillary did.</v>

477
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 1>We'd be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

478
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.421
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

479
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

480
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but as far as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

481
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current mood inside the agency as,</v>

482
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to some former folks,</v>

483
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:23.604
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.200
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>

485
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morale is awful.</v>

486
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

487
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:27.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

488
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hating life because there's not,</v>

489
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't find that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that,</v>

490
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

491
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.643
<v Speaker 1>frankly they're just more focused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>operational concerns and priorities and </v>

492
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:41.730
<v Speaker 1>tasking than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got a personal opinion.</v>

493
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:42.564
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that the agency has </v>

494
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:44.604
<v Speaker 1>proven itself over the years at being </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at pushing that down and </v>

495
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:50.304
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in part because it's a smaller </v>

496
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.163
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right then most of them then almost all </v>

497
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>of them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

498
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't go after the CIA.</v>

499
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only going after the FBI.</v>

500
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 1>He's got the FBI.</v>

501
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:01.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

502
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:02.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's questioned,</v>

503
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:02.964
<v Speaker 1>he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done some things in terms of </v>

504
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:05.940
<v Speaker 1>questioning CIA analysis and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

505
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.751
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

506
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:07.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>some of the advice and guidance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they provided.</v>

508
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>But that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of look at and go,</v>

509
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:13.651
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

510
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 1>we're feeding this into the NSC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Security Council.</v>

511
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.513
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

513
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 1>that's an editorial process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

514
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to have to make your </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

515
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

516
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

517
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.393
<v Speaker 1>people are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying this because I'm </v>

518
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 1>subjective and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm providing top cover for the agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

520
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:29.963
<v Speaker 1>they just focus on getting shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also have the benefit of big </v>

521
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 1>focused overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not like the bureau is,</v>

522
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a domestic organization,</v>

523
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:38.244
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

524
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're drawn in,</v>

525
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 1>the agency's got the advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

526
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 1>we're having to deal with crap over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and not here.</v>

527
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.013
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you think when he said that </v>

528
00:19:48.371 --> 00:19:51.870
<v Speaker 1>we're going to pull out of Syria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

529
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

530
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had that,</v>

531
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

532
00:19:55.471 --> 00:19:58.980
<v Speaker 1>we've lost some servicemen up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Syria today.</v>

533
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today as a result of a bombing up there.</v>

534
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis has taken credit for it.</v>

535
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

536
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrol and we,</v>

537
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and we've got roughly 2000 personnel in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria.</v>

538
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.363
<v Speaker 1>And for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing there where they're </v>

539
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:15.320
<v Speaker 1>providing a guidance training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

540
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.530
<v Speaker 1>they're assisting with targeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

541
00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because the,</v>

542
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.830
<v Speaker 1>the air power is incredibly important </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there right now.</v>

543
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And so we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

544
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 1>our personnel are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

545
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.080
<v Speaker 1>very much involved in selection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification of targets,</v>

546
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the air campaign.</v>

547
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

548
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.383
<v Speaker 1>so we have these 2000 troops here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President says he's going to withdraw </v>

549
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:39.654
<v Speaker 1>and then then some of the members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration started walking that dog </v>

550
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

551
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

552
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I know it may not happen right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

553
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was just a,</v>

554
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.810
<v Speaker 1>a routine patrol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

555
00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 1>if there this never really such thing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a routine patrol,</v>

556
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's a patrol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

557
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.880
<v Speaker 1>and it got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

558
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:55.714
<v Speaker 1>the military is not releasing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>details because they haven't finished </v>

559
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 1>notifying next to kin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

560
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.953
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers so far indicate possibly for </v>

561
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

562
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>

563
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to refocus,</v>

564
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I think Congress and hopefully the White</v>
<v Speaker 1>House on what the hell is going on.</v>

565
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 1>The problem I've got with it is in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of withdrawing,</v>

566
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.493
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could stay there forever and not </v>

567
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:24.430
<v Speaker 1>accomplish the task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

568
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 1>If the task is to finally defeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means,</v>

569
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical Islamic jihadists,</v>

570
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.523
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>

571
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit's never going to happen.</v>

572
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.193
<v Speaker 1>Not In our lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get rid of that </v>

573
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.860
<v Speaker 1>mentality that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ideology,</v>

574
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of what seems to be sometimes a</v>

575
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.094
<v Speaker 1>bottomless well of recruits that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can draw on their ability to morph into </v>

576
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:51.560
<v Speaker 1>something else as al Qaeda did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

577
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.443
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how successful we are in a </v>

578
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:56.170
<v Speaker 1>campaign against them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

579
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:56.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

580
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:57.041
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

581
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:57.611
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:21:57.611 --> 00:21:58.151
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 1>step on roaches over here and they pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>up over here.</v>

584
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

585
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problem I've got is,</v>

586
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 1>is that if we leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

587
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

588
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we're engaged in </v>

589
00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>firefights everyday with isis over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

590
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:15.964
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've left that to our allies and our </v>

591
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>allies in most part up there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north of Syria are the Kurds.</v>

592
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 1>The Kurds have been our allies in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>way or another in that part of the world</v>

593
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:26.974
<v Speaker 1>for a long time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it played a very important role and </v>

594
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.770
<v Speaker 1>we have not been particularly honorable </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>

595
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 1>over the years in terms of how sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>we deal with them.</v>

596
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.600
<v Speaker 1>If we walk out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we leave,</v>

597
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.030
<v Speaker 1>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irwin,</v>

598
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of Turkey,</v>

599
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.253
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you we'll be in there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>short order to kill as many of them as </v>

600
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 1>possible because that's just what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkish authorities are going to do.</v>

601
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 1>They honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

602
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.343
<v Speaker 1>that they couldn't be happier with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>announcement that we're going to leave </v>

603
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 1>because that opens the door for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

604
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 1>go in there and from their perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stamp out the Kurdish alliance that have</v>

605
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:06.214
<v Speaker 1>been our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the only thing our presence at </v>

606
00:23:08.501 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 1>small presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:10.770
<v Speaker 1>not minimizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

608
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 troops has been what's prevented </v>

609
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:16.090
<v Speaker 1>them from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

610
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the number one issue I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is,</v>

611
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.893
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why any president or vice</v>
<v Speaker 1>president or anybody in the government </v>

612
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.323
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this is administration or any </v>

613
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.064
<v Speaker 1>administration ever thinks it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good idea to say we've defeated </v>

614
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.360
<v Speaker 1>the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

615
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.273
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about radical Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen it over and over again from </v>

616
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>previous administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Bush administration.</v>

617
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Every time they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done it,</v>

619
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished though we'd be,</v>

620
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 1>we'd beaten al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we beat nicest.</v>

621
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no upside to saying that.</v>

622
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying things like that.</v>

623
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a self inflicted wound at the,</v>

624
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.393
<v Speaker 1>because now what's happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media is not focused on the fact that </v>

625
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 1>we've lost servicemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're focused on,</v>

626
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:57.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

627
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the other day the president said,</v>

628
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>we defeated Isis and the vice president </v>
<v Speaker 1>today said the same thing.</v>

629
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Now look what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no benefit to saying that.</v>

630
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:06.701
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

631
00:24:06.701 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's not going to happen anyway.</v>

632
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 2>So the goal of being over there is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assist our allies,</v>

633
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:17.831
<v Speaker 2>but also to make sure that these radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>factions don't become more powerful.</v>

634
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually affect us and attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

635
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 2>And so we can keep an eye on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're planning,</v>

636
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

637
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 2>is that an accurate</v>

638
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

639
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:26.981
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

640
00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:27.501
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

641
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

642
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 1>if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason we went into Afghanistan,</v>

643
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we go back all those years,</v>

644
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

645
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.830
<v Speaker 1>and that was because the Taliban </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed,</v>

646
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:43.783
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda to establish a beachhead in </v>

647
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:47.624
<v Speaker 1>there for training and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications and for finance and for </v>

648
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 1>plotting and planning attacks outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan against us and our allies.</v>

649
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 1>That's why we went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from just seeking revenge,</v>

650
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously was to route that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We then stayed,</v>

651
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking somehow we were going to turn </v>

652
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 1>the tide of history and create some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudo federal democracy.</v>

653
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that didn't,</v>

654
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:16.331
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason now for being in Syria is</v>

655
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.710
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

656
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:22.580
<v Speaker 1>we have done a very solid job of beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>back isis,</v>

657
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 1>removing their territory and degrading </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to operate.</v>

658
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.490
<v Speaker 1>But we haven't stamped them out.</v>

659
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.740
<v Speaker 1>We haven't defeated them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still there.</v>

660
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And so we've been providing the support </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

661
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.690
<v Speaker 1>again in the form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

662
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardware,</v>

663
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>gear of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

664
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly a comp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

665
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.040
<v Speaker 1>combat air operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air assaults.</v>

666
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

667
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 1>that's been critically important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we leave,</v>

668
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt that isis will find some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to rejuvenate,</v>

669
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe not in its current form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

670
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not in the same exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>locations,</v>

671
00:25:57.681 --> 00:25:59.330
<v Speaker 1>but they don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what they do.</v>

672
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just find a way to adapt.</v>

673
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.310
<v Speaker 1>And we already know what's happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past when we,</v>

674
00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:05.144
<v Speaker 1>when we left Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw what happened with the rise of </v>

675
00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

676
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do I want to stay there forever.</v>

677
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.403
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But both sides can make a valid </v>

678
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:16.370
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One for staying,</v>

679
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:20.950
<v Speaker 1>one for leaving my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best argument for staying in</v>

680
00:26:20.951 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it certainly is short and midterm,</v>

681
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.550
<v Speaker 1>is to ensure that ertl on doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughter a bunch of Kurtz who have been</v>

682
00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>working with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

683
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>honorably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

684
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else to say that.</v>

685
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.610
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

686
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

687
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.793
<v Speaker 2>best argument to stay is to protect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that helped us to protect our </v>

688
00:26:38.551 --> 00:26:39.340
<v Speaker 2>allies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

689
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not in our best interest is in </v>

690
00:26:41.281 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>the best interest of our commitment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement with them.</v>

691
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it in our national security interests</v>

692
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:50.660
<v Speaker 1>do to stay in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example?</v>

693
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this,</v>

694
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.323
<v Speaker 1>that has so many levels to this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure right now everybody's </v>

695
00:26:54.981 --> 00:26:56.150
<v Speaker 1>listening going off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Sake.</v>

696
00:26:56.151 --> 00:26:57.560
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to disappear down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit hole.</v>

697
00:26:57.561 --> 00:26:58.880
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

698
00:26:58.881 --> 00:26:59.714
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

699
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>

700
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.180
<v Speaker 1>For a while there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this,</v>

701
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.340
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea,</v>

702
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.193
<v Speaker 1>this was ridiculous pie in the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that we were going to get the </v>

703
00:27:06.111 --> 00:27:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Russians out of Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to fucking happen.</v>

704
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Russian said the only port for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Sea fleet as in Syria,</v>

705
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w w they've been there for decades and </v>

706
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.500
<v Speaker 1>decades along with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're net,</v>

707
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.753
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna happen unless we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to war with Russia to kick them out </v>

708
00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:23.420
<v Speaker 1>of Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not in our best interest.</v>

709
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.613
<v Speaker 1>So is it in our national security </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to keep troops there to fight </v>

710
00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:29.900
<v Speaker 1>and try to minimize Russian involvement </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Syria?</v>

711
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.733
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so because we're not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shift them off that dime without </v>

712
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.900
<v Speaker 1>going directly at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

713
00:27:35.901 --> 00:27:36.734
<v Speaker 1>It's in their best interest to stay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every nation accidents own best </v>

714
00:27:39.831 --> 00:27:41.660
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to shift Iran?</v>

715
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to keep Iran from forming </v>
<v Speaker 1>too late for that?</v>

716
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 1>They've already got a beachhead there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not going to give up.</v>

717
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to set those issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>aside and say,</v>

718
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:52.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are we doing there?</v>

719
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh we there simply because we have to,</v>

720
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish the fight against Isis.</v>

721
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:28:00.321 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>at some point you gotta say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

723
00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wouldn't say that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

724
00:28:04.361 --> 00:28:06.380
<v Speaker 1>we've defeated them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we would say,</v>

725
00:28:06.381 --> 00:28:08.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've degraded them sufficiently that we</v>

726
00:28:08.151 --> 00:28:08.984
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can now operate from elsewhere and </v>

727
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.263
<v Speaker 1>then we can operate from forward basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in other locations where we're </v>

728
00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:16.490
<v Speaker 1>currently based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

729
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.193
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep coming back to the same thing </v>

730
00:28:19.161 --> 00:28:19.671
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

731
00:28:19.671 --> 00:28:21.740
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've worked with the Kurds.</v>

732
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Is this in our national security </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest?</v>

733
00:28:23.481 --> 00:28:24.314
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

734
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something that tells me it's</v>

735
00:28:27.321 --> 00:28:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the right thing to do and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's enough,</v>

736
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should,</v>

737
00:28:31.701 --> 00:28:34.130
<v Speaker 1>we should not let [inaudible] have his </v>
<v Speaker 1>way</v>

738
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.043
<v Speaker 2>and also longterm wouldn't it be in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>best interest to honor our commitment </v>

739
00:28:39.461 --> 00:28:44.461
<v Speaker 2>and make sure that we protect our allies</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that in the future other allies would</v>

740
00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:45.514
<v Speaker 2>be more willing to cooperate with us </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they understand that once we're </v>

741
00:28:49.301 --> 00:28:52.060
<v Speaker 2>committed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fully committed and we stay and we</v>

742
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:53.260
<v Speaker 2>stand for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

743
00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.660
<v Speaker 2>So what's the benefit of getting out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that see,</v>

744
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.543
<v Speaker 2>think we should get out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when trump said he wanted to pull </v>

745
00:28:59.381 --> 00:29:00.700
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's his thinking</v>

746
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.730
<v Speaker 1>runs particularly deep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just,</v>

747
00:29:03.731 --> 00:29:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

748
00:29:04.841 --> 00:29:06.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the campaign he talked about,</v>

749
00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:08.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping the endless wars.</v>

750
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.990
<v Speaker 1>That's very popular concept right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

751
00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

752
00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:12.570
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

753
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.980
<v Speaker 1>and so it will be interesting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:29:14.981 --> 00:29:18.760
<v Speaker 1>what today's sad event does up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitol Hill,</v>

755
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they,</v>

756
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.430
<v Speaker 1>do they rethink their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

757
00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:23.200
<v Speaker 1>the withdrawal or do they accelerate it?</v>

758
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they had the buildup in Iraq </v>

759
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.930
<v Speaker 2>and it was highly criticized but then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was very effective,</v>

760
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.260
<v Speaker 2>like it did do what they intended it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

761
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it did knock back the enemy.</v>

762
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:38.443
<v Speaker 2>If they decided to ramp it up worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that be a solution to any of this </v>

763
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:45.244
<v Speaker 2>or is the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it better to actually ramp up our </v>

764
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 2>defenses domestically and just stay the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck away from all of these people?</v>

765
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

766
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:54.883
<v Speaker 1>well eventually you can only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can only do so much I think </v>

767
00:29:57.291 --> 00:29:59.370
<v Speaker 1>on the domestic front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

768
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

769
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

770
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.450
<v Speaker 1>if they gained sufficient ability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

771
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.700
<v Speaker 1>we've seen that from past attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think then,</v>

772
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.190
<v Speaker 1>then they'll come after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come after us.</v>

773
00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the way I suppose that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work.</v>

774
00:30:13.911 --> 00:30:18.290
<v Speaker 1>But I don't disagree with the notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is hard pressed.</v>

775
00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have stayed in Afghanistan.</v>

776
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.043
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether they've increased </v>

777
00:30:22.401 --> 00:30:25.220
<v Speaker 1>their literacy rate by 2% are built </v>
<v Speaker 1>another road or whatever.</v>

778
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

779
00:30:26.331 --> 00:30:27.710
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the hell we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to sell them.</v>

780
00:30:27.711 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

781
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against the notion of getting </v>

782
00:30:31.761 --> 00:30:34.460
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one's a tough one.</v>

783
00:30:34.461 --> 00:30:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the Syria issue is,</v>

784
00:30:36.831 --> 00:30:37.664
<v Speaker 1>I'm real conflicted on because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurds and what they've done on our </v>

785
00:30:40.641 --> 00:30:43.550
<v Speaker 1>behalf in the past and how they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered and knowing,</v>

786
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going years and years back,</v>

787
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having dealt with that issue,</v>

788
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half decades ago,</v>

789
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.540
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago with the Turks and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurds,</v>

790
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.643
<v Speaker 1>knowing how vicious that could be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't trust her to want as far as </v>

791
00:30:58.161 --> 00:30:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I could throw him on a window.</v>

792
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

793
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a problem there that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to,</v>

794
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.410
<v Speaker 1>we need to make sure we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>through thoroughly before we just say,</v>

795
00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:07.760
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get them out of there.</v>

796
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:08.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>

797
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't have them there.</v>

798
00:31:10.111 --> 00:31:13.220
<v Speaker 1>And we shouldn't be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like everything else,</v>

799
00:31:13.221 --> 00:31:13.681
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

800
00:31:13.681 --> 00:31:14.514
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would like to think that what </v>

801
00:31:15.531 --> 00:31:17.510
<v Speaker 1>they're having conversations like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on Capitol Hill,</v>

802
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the,</v>

803
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.600
<v Speaker 1>the parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

804
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Republicans or the Dems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they are,</v>

805
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.930
<v Speaker 2>that's what was concerning me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What concerns me is,</v>

806
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.533
<v Speaker 2>especially a guy like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if trump is the guy who was decided </v>

807
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:32.570
<v Speaker 2>we're going to pull out a Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

808
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.533
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does he have enough time to </v>

809
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:40.241
<v Speaker 2>carefully consider that as well as all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other things that are on his plate.</v>

810
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.330
<v Speaker 2>And when someone runs for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save someone's campaigning and they say,</v>

811
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.223
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support a non interventional as </v>

812
00:31:50.001 --> 00:31:52.520
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get us out of these,</v>

813
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.383
<v Speaker 2>these wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get there doing this based </v>

814
00:31:55.671 --> 00:32:00.671
<v Speaker 2>on a limited amount of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not like the CIA or the FBI or</v>

815
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody briefs them as they're running </v>
<v Speaker 2>for president.</v>

816
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't have clearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

817
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.310
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

818
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until you become the party nominee,</v>

819
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.713
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

820
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.320
<v Speaker 2>When you're the party nominee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then do you get a discussion?</v>

821
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Get you get some access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

822
00:32:14.361 --> 00:32:16.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not your stone out the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

823
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:20.990
<v Speaker 1>But you are given some ability to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more intensive briefings.</v>

824
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

825
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.753
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not to the degree that the </v>

826
00:32:23.751 --> 00:32:24.030
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

827
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.863
<v Speaker 2>so someone like Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was already secretary of State </v>

828
00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She already knew pretty much</v>

829
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.833
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

830
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had,</v>

831
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

832
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.640
<v Speaker 1>she was very switched on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very informed.</v>

833
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.750
<v Speaker 1>She would just an awful candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

834
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

835
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.031
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:45.020
<v Speaker 1>so I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

837
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:45.854
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things that this </v>

838
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.450
<v Speaker 1>administration is doing foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise that I think are good.</v>

839
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.400
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

840
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.810
<v Speaker 1>there were other things that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you just leave you scratching your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

842
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.153
<v Speaker 1>but that's like every administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess my point is we've gotten away </v>

843
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 1>from that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

844
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I have conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go out to dinner with folks that,</v>

845
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

846
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:05.924
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the hard left and when you talk to </v>

847
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:11.750
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fully believe,</v>

848
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.290
<v Speaker 1>fully believe that president trump is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian puppet,</v>

849
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.430
<v Speaker 1>a wedding asset of Putin who is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing Putin's bidding.</v>

850
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.563
<v Speaker 1>And they honestly honestly believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing is going to shift them off </v>

851
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that position too.</v>

852
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 1>When you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:28.094
<v Speaker 1>that sort of frame of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the ability to look at </v>

854
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 1>anything rationally and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

855
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this policy related to China.</v>

856
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.433
<v Speaker 1>It's about time we call them out and say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you obviously have not been a fair </v>

857
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:39.914
<v Speaker 1>trading partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that every </v>

858
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:43.750
<v Speaker 1>administration has agreed to but has </v>
<v Speaker 1>never done anything about.</v>

859
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 1>So you would think that everybody will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to say,</v>

860
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.850
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>

861
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

862
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should be able to say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

863
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>system here in the,</v>

864
00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 1>in the states is somewhat dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs fixing.</v>

865
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.573
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's talked about that and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it because they've got </v>

866
00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.930
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mindset that,</v>

867
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 1>that that prevents them from having any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of conversation,</v>

868
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:07.400
<v Speaker 1>any sort of rational discussion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could lead to some compromise that could</v>

869
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 1>then advance the ball and make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>government more functional.</v>

870
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:11.623
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

871
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 3>so where we're at right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

872
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.960
<v Speaker 3>today is day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the shutdown?</v>

873
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:17.243
<v Speaker 3>26th I think that would just be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>800,000 American workers that work for </v>

874
00:34:23.041 --> 00:34:23.874
<v Speaker 3>the government are not getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are a month out many of these </v>

875
00:34:27.181 --> 00:34:32.181
<v Speaker 3>people paycheck to paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have medical necessities,</v>

876
00:34:32.851 --> 00:34:33.684
<v Speaker 3>they don't have food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are happening to our rationale </v>

877
00:34:35.821 --> 00:34:36.860
<v Speaker 3>off their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

878
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.120
<v Speaker 3>their insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're diabetic.</v>

879
00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm hearing these horror horror </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

880
00:34:41.131 --> 00:34:44.220
<v Speaker 3>the lines at the airport or around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking block.</v>

881
00:34:44.221 --> 00:34:45.510
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's chaos.</v>

882
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.090
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like there's no end in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sight.</v>

883
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like trump has just content</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

884
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.260
<v Speaker 3>to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold this position.</v>

885
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.163
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think both sides are content to hold </v>

886
00:34:53.731 --> 00:34:56.310
<v Speaker 3>their position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems fucking crazy to me.</v>

887
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.250
<v Speaker 3>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely crazy.</v>

888
00:34:59.251 --> 00:35:00.084
<v Speaker 3>If you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just 800,000 I don't know </v>

889
00:35:01.531 --> 00:35:03.240
<v Speaker 3>the exact numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but think about all the,</v>

890
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:04.703
<v Speaker 3>the contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when all the government </v>

891
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:06.570
<v Speaker 3>contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

892
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.210
<v Speaker 3>I stay in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're good</v>

893
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.850
<v Speaker 1>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

894
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this has,</v>

895
00:35:12.241 --> 00:35:12.841
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

896
00:35:12.841 --> 00:35:14.520
<v Speaker 1>the administration has admitted that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

897
00:35:14.521 --> 00:35:17.130
<v Speaker 1>we initially underestimated the impact </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

898
00:35:17.131 --> 00:35:20.910
<v Speaker 1>of a longer term shutdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they understand that.</v>

899
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:35:22.111 --> 00:35:24.900
<v Speaker 1>talk about it every minute about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a terrible crisis.</v>

901
00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And so you would think that if both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides feel that way,</v>

902
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.613
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then get something done and looked at </v>

903
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.040
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats that they've approved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

904
00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:35.874
<v Speaker 1>recent past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these Democrats voted for </v>

905
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 1>fencing barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it.</v>

906
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:40.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're lost in semantics and because </v>

907
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:43.640
<v Speaker 1>the president's so hated by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

908
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.080
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

909
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 1>this group that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

910
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 1>they've seized on this term wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he had started his campaign by saying</v>

911
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.330
<v Speaker 1>we need to improve our border security </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

912
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find fixes to an immigration system that</v>

913
00:35:57.391 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 1>is both fair and secure and efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he had gone with that,</v>

914
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:02.604
<v Speaker 1>it's a word he bumper sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he had gone with that and we'd </v>

915
00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:06.390
<v Speaker 1>have a different conversation right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>

916
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but maybe would have a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>president as well.</v>

917
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

918
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:12.384
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

919
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.920
<v Speaker 3>There's something about that build that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall that's like the dopes.</v>

920
00:36:15.921 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

921
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.830
<v Speaker 3>get it John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wall.</v>

922
00:36:18.831 --> 00:36:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Still simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Build a wall.</v>

923
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look her castle build a wall.</v>

924
00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.580
<v Speaker 3>It seems so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

925
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.380
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a visual.</v>

926
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.171
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

927
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:28.861
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

928
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:29.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I miss out.</v>

929
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way off on the,</v>

930
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 1>in terms of being clever about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

931
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to rope in rubes.</v>

932
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should,</v>

933
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I should get better at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's got that down boy.</v>

934
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know the people that voted</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>

935
00:36:45.941 --> 00:36:47.980
<v Speaker 3>The people that are like real mag </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters,</v>

936
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know they existed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

937
00:36:50.411 --> 00:36:53.140
<v Speaker 3>They exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he uncovered a rock.</v>

938
00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Like you flipped a rock over and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was an ant colony of rubes in there.</v>

939
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.640
<v Speaker 3>And just the sheer numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

940
00:37:00.641 --> 00:37:03.370
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the top patio.</v>

941
00:37:03.371 --> 00:37:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mixed bag.</v>

942
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.080
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of people very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.150
<v Speaker 1>cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

944
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy the idea that it's all just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of crackers or a bunch of </v>

945
00:37:11.781 --> 00:37:12.700
<v Speaker 1>idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

946
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:13.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

947
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a real range of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

948
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.333
<v Speaker 1>there's that group of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just tired of being told they're idiots </v>

949
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.370
<v Speaker 1>and they came out in force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

950
00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk down to people.</v>

951
00:37:22.971 --> 00:37:23.804
<v Speaker 1>This is for the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep talking down to people </v>

952
00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:26.810
<v Speaker 1>and expect at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can punch in the nose.</v>

953
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:27.271
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

954
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:31.690
<v Speaker 3>they're still doing that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's still a there,</v>

955
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.260
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some congressmen recently that</v>

956
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 3>was talked about all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>supported trump and he was talking about</v>

957
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:42.180
<v Speaker 3>them all being losers and alcoholics and</v>
<v Speaker 3>illiterate.</v>

958
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

959
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about half the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

960
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.980
<v Speaker 1>No lesson learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

961
00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:48.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

962
00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:51.190
<v Speaker 1>No self awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

963
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.330
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:37:52.331 --> 00:37:53.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the story of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

965
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every election I think going forward is,</v>

966
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

967
00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.893
<v Speaker 1>you've got the urban centers and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got everybody else and everybody else </v>

968
00:38:03.371 --> 00:38:05.800
<v Speaker 1>feels as if they're getting kicked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ass.</v>

969
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

970
00:38:08.171 --> 00:38:09.910
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

971
00:38:09.911 --> 00:38:11.080
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

972
00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.040
<v Speaker 1>we should be able to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should.</v>

973
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

974
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:20.410
<v Speaker 1>certain policies that they've got great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every day,</v>

975
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.800
<v Speaker 1>another tweet that seems a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional every day,</v>

976
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some misstep every day,</v>

977
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:27.460
<v Speaker 1>some self inflicted wound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

978
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.320
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in a country.</v>

979
00:38:29.321 --> 00:38:30.160
<v Speaker 1>This size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

980
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:33.100
<v Speaker 1>not where we've got this much talent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>skill and capability.</v>

981
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what 20 is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring,</v>

982
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to,</v>

983
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:39.250
<v Speaker 1>we're in for a hell of a ride between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

984
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the shit that's happening.</v>

985
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems like it might be one of the </v>

986
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:46.110
<v Speaker 2>bigger moves on the chessboard though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This government shutdown,</v>

987
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.140
<v Speaker 2>like how this gets resolved one way or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and who comes out,</v>

988
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:50.974
<v Speaker 2>at least the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the visual is the optics are that </v>

989
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:55.900
<v Speaker 2>they're the winner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

990
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.793
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems very critical because if the </v>

991
00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Democrats win and somehow or another he </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandons his idea for a wall,</v>

992
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.123
<v Speaker 2>abandons the billions of dollars that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been asking for for this wall that </v>

993
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:07.024
<v Speaker 2>gives them momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kicked his ass with that wall and </v>

994
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:12.010
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kick his ass and 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20</v>

995
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.590
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

996
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:14.783
<v Speaker 1>that is exactly what they're discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the war room when Nancy Pelosi keeps </v>

997
00:39:17.191 --> 00:39:18.024
<v Speaker 1>them all in lockstep and she's done a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good job so far of keeping the dams in </v>

998
00:39:20.851 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

999
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.620
<v Speaker 1>and that's why they wanted her back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the old guard wanted it back in</v>

1000
00:39:25.621 --> 00:39:26.850
<v Speaker 1>because that's what she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1001
00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:29.760
<v Speaker 1>aside from fundraising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

1002
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that,</v>

1003
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.460
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's asking for whatever,</v>

1004
00:39:32.461 --> 00:39:34.650
<v Speaker 1>five point $7 billion in the scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1005
00:39:34.651 --> 00:39:35.484
<v Speaker 1>That's a drop in the bucket and Schumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Pelosi in a wide variety of other </v>

1006
00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:39.840
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the previous president and all</v>

1007
00:39:39.841 --> 00:39:42.270
<v Speaker 1>voted in the past for additional funding</v>
<v Speaker 1>for border security,</v>

1008
00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:44.930
<v Speaker 1>including fencing and barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they aren't,</v>

1009
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.240
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to budge off of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell does that mean?</v>

1010
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's being pushed into a corner where he</v>

1011
00:39:51.421 --> 00:39:52.254
<v Speaker 1>has no option but to declare a national </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency and use funds elsewhere so </v>

1012
00:39:54.811 --> 00:39:55.644
<v Speaker 1>that he can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally got it done and looked at </v>

1013
00:39:56.611 --> 00:39:57.480
<v Speaker 1>demos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do anything.</v>

1014
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1015
00:39:59.521 --> 00:40:00.630
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

1016
00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Whoever's perceived as the winner out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1017
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous situation.</v>

1018
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1019
00:40:07.201 --> 00:40:09.060
<v Speaker 1>they're going to beat that drum all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to 2020.</v>

1020
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.233
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they've been saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>too about the wall is that they want to </v>

1021
00:40:12.821 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 2>keep drugs from coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1022
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 2>illegal drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from this El Chapo trial,</v>

1023
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:19.683
<v Speaker 2>we're learning how the biggest drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealer in Mexico got his drugs and they </v>

1024
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:25.210
<v Speaker 2>didn't use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get it through the wall.</v>

1025
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 2>They brought it in through mostly boats.</v>

1026
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually not,</v>

1027
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just meals,</v>

1028
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals carton into cross some,</v>

1029
00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:33.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken part of the,</v>

1030
00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:34.900
<v Speaker 1>of the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought it</v>

1031
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.730
<v Speaker 2>cars in hidden compartments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought it in through boats.</v>

1032
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1033
00:40:39.861 --> 00:40:40.501
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1034
00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:41.334
<v Speaker 2>they basically have some people spilling</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beans as to how the exact operation </v>

1035
00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:44.874
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was functional and it didn't seem to </v>

1036
00:40:46.591 --> 00:40:49.200
<v Speaker 2>involve people carrying it over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>border on backpack.</v>

1037
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Now when it goes months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1038
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 1>El Chapo is a lieutenants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

1039
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.373
<v Speaker 1>as a cooperating witness and he's now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's now claiming that the former </v>

1040
00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:03.751
<v Speaker 1>president of Mexico and UNESCO was given</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100 million at the outset of his term,</v>

1041
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2012 when he started as </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1042
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So when he was president lacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd already won.</v>

1043
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:14.500
<v Speaker 1>But he had his wedding to take the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to this,</v>

1044
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>this Colombian trafficker who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with Guzman with chapel,</v>

1045
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>a pinion eto reached out to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly there was campaign manager.</v>

1046
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.860
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story goes,</v>

1047
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 1>my friend and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he asked for 250 million and chapel,</v>

1048
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back with a negotiated position.</v>

1049
00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It says 100 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was then according to this,</v>

1050
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.760
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's a Colombian trafficker.</v>

1051
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1052
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 1>how legitimate is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1053
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1054
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:41.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money was transferred to opinion at </v>

1055
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.143
<v Speaker 1>tdot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1056
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion at all.</v>

1057
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Those people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

1058
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were the ones who tracked him down,</v>

1059
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we escaped,</v>

1060
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 times or whatever,</v>

1061
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 1>he escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1062
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always been this,</v>

1063
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.600
<v Speaker 1>this talk about how chopos arrests were </v>
<v Speaker 1>orchestrated,</v>

1064
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1065
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.613
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the,</v>

1066
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military,</v>

1067
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 1>the police were involved somehow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a coordinated effort.</v>

1068
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1069
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 1>there's always been that underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>rumor,</v>

1070
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible anything's possible.</v>

1071
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 3>But if he did get $100 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think El Chapo would be free.</v>

1072
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ if $100 million and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>your free.</v>

1073
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1074
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:21.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you would,</v>

1076
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would assume that,</v>

1077
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the upside for Chapo to,</v>

1078
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.150
<v Speaker 1>to not talk about it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1079
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1080
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1081
00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.203
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a precedent to mean where's he </v>

1082
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.970
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have tax returns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could look at,</v>

1083
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a lot of cash.</v>

1084
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.473
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved it.</v>

1085
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.333
<v Speaker 1>Just moved it off shore immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was according to this </v>

1086
00:42:41.741 --> 00:42:46.300
<v Speaker 1>witness or to this cooperating witness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money was delivered.</v>

1087
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.413
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this may be the part of the story that </v>

1088
00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:49.954
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was delivered to his campaign plane </v>

1089
00:42:51.281 --> 00:42:54.760
<v Speaker 1>or something in his campaign manager </v>
<v Speaker 1>took control of it and then they whisked</v>

1090
00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:55.350
<v Speaker 1>it away.</v>

1091
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hole in the ground somewhere.</v>

1092
00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.470
<v Speaker 3>It takes out a little at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep everybody on that hush hush.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know she did that to that broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1137
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting when these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>these people just try so hard to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the news.</v>

1139
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for a contributor slot.</v>

1140
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.120
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for on one network or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1141
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to nowadays,</v>

1142
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1143
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 1>at least my theory is anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be a paid contributor for</v>

1144
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:11.471
<v Speaker 1>a network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1145
00:45:11.471 --> 00:45:14.640
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter which network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll got to stake out a position.</v>

1146
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that involves some crazy,</v>

1147

<v Speaker 1>gotta be all out if you,</v>

1149
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 1>if you live in the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ain't happening.</v>

1150
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to hear from anybody in the</v>

1151
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 1>middle because that Shit's not picking </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the ratings at all.</v>

1152
00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So no one wants reasonable middle right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

1153
00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1154
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 1>The only time that I think reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

1155
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:36.444
<v Speaker 1>whatever workout as if the two ends are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucked up and they're fighting so </v>

1156

<v Speaker 1>hard on the opposite ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone's like,</v>

1157

1158
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:45.234
<v Speaker 1>middle and then someone comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the people gotta be </v>

1159
00:45:47.641 --> 00:45:48.474
<v Speaker 1>screaming for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now it doesn't seem like </v>

1160
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 1>people are screaming for no sensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>centrist position.</v>

1161
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like a world war one trench </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare,</v>

1162
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.120
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>president trump's sitting over here in </v>

1165
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the mud and nobody's given any ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just,</v>

1166
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>they're just occasionally taking a shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>at each other.</v>

1167
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Throwing a hand grenade and nobody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making any,</v>

1168
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.030
<v Speaker 1>any movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1169
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:12.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1170
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.940
<v Speaker 1>how do they shut the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how do they stop the shutdown?</v>

1171
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not talking,</v>

1172
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:18.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>

1173
00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 1>if there's no effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>

1174
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's looking at this right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking,</v>

1175
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's it go?</v>

1176
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 1>It's affecting the markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes us look like morons.</v>

1177
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1178
00:46:29.971 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 1>not that others aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1179
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Britain,</v>

1180
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the brexit thing.</v>

1181
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Look at France with the yellow vests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the,</v>

1182
00:46:35.561 --> 00:46:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's having a tissue.</v>

1183
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:37.944
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1184
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's having some,</v>

1185
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some problems,</v>

1186
00:46:40.441 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't need to add to the noise.</v>

1187
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 1>John Stossel had an interesting video </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he put out where he's saying,</v>

1188
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.993
<v Speaker 1>what this does actually highlight is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a lot of things that the </v>

1189
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 1>government does.</v>

1190
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It really should probably be privatized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we wouldn't have these issues.</v>

1191
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1192
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it kind of made sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know a lot.</v>

1193
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1194
00:46:58.141 --> 00:46:58.531
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1195
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a small government person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

1196
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:01.261
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1197
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rely on the government for a,</v>

1198
00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:06.840
<v Speaker 1>and one of them would be of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national security,</v>

1199
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:07.771
<v Speaker 1>terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1200
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:09.360
<v Speaker 1>collection of federal taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1201
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:11.220
<v Speaker 1>fine that day they're going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless.</v>

1202
00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise just stand on my kitchen.</v>

1203
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1204
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1205
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1206
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:17.873
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I've always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised me mean the Republican's </v>

1207
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:20.610
<v Speaker 1>problem I got with them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:21.503
<v Speaker 1>you can't sit around and argue for small</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and then try to tell people </v>

1209
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 1>what to do with their bodies or who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get married and who can't get married.</v>

1210
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck cares?</v>

1211
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't,</v>

1212
00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 1>don't hurt people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be a good person.</v>

1213
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:32.763
<v Speaker 1>Get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to celebrate your </v>

1214
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just do it.</v>

1215
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.773
<v Speaker 1>I really don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect you to care about my </v>

1216
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:41.560
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about yours.</v>

1217
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.120
<v Speaker 1>But the Republicans have always stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nose in this and you can't,</v>

1218
00:47:45.121 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't make that argument for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for wanting small government.</v>

1219
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you just want to step into </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's bedrooms all the time,</v>

1220
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.693
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the only reason why they do </v>

1221
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it is because it gets people excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they get to run to,</v>

1222
00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:59.260
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to vote for them.</v>

1223
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I think when they take these positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like these are really having an</v>

1224
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:03.964
<v Speaker 1>effect on their lives or at some moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand that they must take because God </v>

1225
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:07.744
<v Speaker 1>wants them to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they do it because they think </v>

1226
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:10.384
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to shift the pole one way or </v>

1227
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:13.080
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1228
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to get people excited </v>

1229
00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:15.754
<v Speaker 1>about them possibly making some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a difference that they feel is going to </v>

1230
00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 1>significantly affect their position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you ever get to the point,</v>

1231
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:22.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether that's going to </v>

1232
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:24.244
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would think that you've got the </v>

1233
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:28.600
<v Speaker 1>people on the hard right and the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

1234
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1235
00:48:29.891 --> 00:48:31.780
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to move those people.</v>

1236
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:32.614
<v Speaker 1>So like everybody always talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions are made by that small group </v>

1237
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:36.514
<v Speaker 1>in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at what point did the group in the </v>

1238
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 1>center find it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put their hands up and go,</v>

1239
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you guys are all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1240
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.360
<v Speaker 1>How about a third party that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate,</v>

1241
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.910
<v Speaker 1>not a libertarian party because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1242
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.120
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1243
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.513
<v Speaker 1>but something that creates a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a different dynamic and we're never </v>

1244
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 1>going to get term limits.</v>

1245
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.870
<v Speaker 1>tilting at windmills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe,</v>

1247
00:48:55.871 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we get that multiparty thing go on</v>

1248
00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha again.</v>

1249
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pie in the sky.</v>

1250
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:02.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crap.</v>

1251
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Closest we ever got to it was Ross </v>
<v Speaker 1>Perot,</v>

1252
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1253
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:06.094
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1254
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1255
00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 1>it was a piece of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he took out a whole,</v>

1256
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:12.693
<v Speaker 1>he took a block of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a half an hour on </v>

1257
00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 1>national television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bought the time to explain how you're</v>

1258
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And explained taxes and explain all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different things.</v>

1260
00:49:24.491 --> 00:49:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1261
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.190
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

1262
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It's good tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can go back and find it.</v>

1263
00:49:29.821 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Ross Perot was good tv.</v>

1264
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you what I'm doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1265
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1266
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.070
<v Speaker 1>That's all that's all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's where again,</v>

1267
00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shit.</v>

1268
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:41.981
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about,</v>

1269
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:43.690
<v Speaker 1>remember the last time we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Huawei?</v>

1270
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it hasn't gone away.</v>

1271
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't gotten the way sees good.</v>

1272
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Someone just got arrested yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two people,</v>

1273
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.910
<v Speaker 1>two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1274
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1275
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 1>so backstory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1276
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1277
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.113
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an area I could definitely </v>

1278
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.150
<v Speaker 1>disappear down to Chinese espionage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1279
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.960
<v Speaker 1>They go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1280
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.100
<v Speaker 1>once again I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1281
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I talk about are there certain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the current administration is doing</v>

1282
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:08.404
<v Speaker 1>that I like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the way that they're </v>

1283
00:50:09.251 --> 00:50:11.740
<v Speaker 1>dealing with China right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

1284
00:50:11.741 --> 00:50:15.070
<v Speaker 1>the trade issue is buffeting the market </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat and causing some instability.</v>

1285
00:50:15.071 --> 00:50:17.950
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous administration,</v>

1286
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 1>the Bush administration clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of,</v>

1287
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.733
<v Speaker 1>lots of prep from former presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all acknowledged that China pub </v>

1288
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.800
<v Speaker 1>privately was not a fair trading </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>

1289
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.883
<v Speaker 1>This administration's at least trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them out and calling them out on </v>

1290
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:30.321
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1291
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:32.430
<v Speaker 1>in the cyber issue too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1292
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 1>on their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their theft of intellectual property.</v>

1293
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:36.370
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wowway,</v>

1294
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:37.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly owned by the founder and </v>

1295
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.480
<v Speaker 1>however many employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1296
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I think Huawei is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1297
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 1>the number one telecommunications </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment manufacturer in the world.</v>

1298
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And they're the number two seller of </v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphones,</v>

1299
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1300
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:53.961
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1301
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>they're a bigger seller of smartphones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and apple.</v>

1302
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 1>So at Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huawei,</v>

1303
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1304
00:50:59.001 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so supposedly the company's owned by</v>

1305
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:05.420
<v Speaker 1>the founder and his daughter is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chief operating officer,</v>

1306
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.040
<v Speaker 1>chief financial officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those.</v>

1307
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 1>She was arrested up in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1308
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:10.483
<v Speaker 1>and she was arrested at the request of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s she's up there on bail right </v>

1309
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:14.540
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting extradition hearing.</v>

1310
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.033
<v Speaker 1>And the reason was because supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>she lied about wally's dealings with </v>

1311
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:21.344
<v Speaker 1>Iran and they were busting sanctions by </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing and providing certain types of </v>

1312
00:51:24.771 --> 00:51:27.860
<v Speaker 1>equipment to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1313
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:28.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1314
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:29.744
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this past week we've had a hallway </v>

1315
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:36.500
<v Speaker 1>employee who's now been fired by Huawei </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Poland,</v>

1316
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested for espionage.</v>

1317
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 1>And along with him is a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish intelligence service,</v>

1318
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.113
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

1319
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retired now and was now working for a </v>

1320
00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:48.374
<v Speaker 1>French telecommunications company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was arrested also for a espionage </v>

1321
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.170
<v Speaker 1>related to a and unrelated to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual who up until just recently it</v>

1322
00:51:57.171 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 1>was working for wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huawei Claims Innocence and says,</v>

1323
00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:01.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea.</v>

1324
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 1>And the founder just came out and gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big speech and said,</v>

1325
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I would never let the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities tell me what to do.</v>

1326
00:52:07.551 --> 00:52:08.384
<v Speaker 1>And now we'd certainly never spy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody using quallies capabilities and </v>

1327
00:52:11.121 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people are probably thinking,</v>

1328
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This for?</v>

1329
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.920
<v Speaker 1>A Huawei embeds their telecommunications</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment throughout the world,</v>

1330
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in,</v>

1331
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1332
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:25.530
<v Speaker 1>our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1333
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 1>military operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then are connected to ours,</v>

1334
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:29.953
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of communications and transfer </v>

1335
00:52:30.951 --> 00:52:33.320
<v Speaker 1>of intelligence and information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1336
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

1337
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.713
<v Speaker 1>And they chose Poland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been in Poland for about 10 </v>

1338
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland is a very important NATO ally.</v>

1339
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:41.203
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1340
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized to explain this,</v>

1341
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm trying to say is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens by happenstance,</v>

1342
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese don't operate that way.</v>

1343
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.850
<v Speaker 1>So the Chinese authorities sometime ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1344
00:52:52.851 --> 00:52:54.380
<v Speaker 1>looked at it and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1345
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.940
<v Speaker 1>this makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1346
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.380
<v Speaker 1>We've got Huawei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

1347
00:52:57.381 --> 00:52:59.340
<v Speaker 1>the founder is a former military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1348
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.330
<v Speaker 1>people's Liberation Army engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1349
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:03.830
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1350
00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:05.430
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1351
00:53:05.431 --> 00:53:06.980
<v Speaker 1>they looked at this and they thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland,</v>

1352
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good beachhead for us,</v>

1353
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are a key element of NATO,</v>

1354
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:13.093
<v Speaker 1>so let's go to Poland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they started a burrowing into Poland </v>

1355
00:53:15.501 --> 00:53:16.334
<v Speaker 1>striking deals and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically the most important </v>

1356
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:18.943
<v Speaker 1>foreign relationship now a corporation </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside a Poland and they're fully </v>

1357
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Speaker 1>embedded and they've had access to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point to NATO communications.</v>

1358
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And now the arrest of these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

1359
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And people will still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite this and despite their past,</v>

1360
00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 1>despite their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1361
00:53:36.931 --> 00:53:39.890
<v Speaker 1>their theft of information from </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody from us steel to,</v>

1362
00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Alcoa,</v>

1363
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 1>to Lockheed Martin to dupont,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the times that they've been stealing</v>

1364
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:47.950
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will still go wide.</v>

1365
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1366
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1367
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:51.594
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why the Chinese would act </v>

1368
00:53:53.011 --> 00:53:54.450
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see why we're being so harsh</v>

1369
00:53:54.451 --> 00:53:55.290
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1370
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 1>this tariff thing is a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point being,</v>

1371
00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:58.853
<v Speaker 1>you got to call them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to necessarily change </v>

1372
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.660
<v Speaker 1>their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to raise public awareness,</v>

1373
00:54:03.661 --> 00:54:04.494
<v Speaker 1>make uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our allies understanding where that's </v>

1374
00:54:05.671 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're saying you've gotta,</v>

1375
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta put the brakes on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build a firewall,</v>

1376
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.500
<v Speaker 1>use other companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telecommunications equipment.</v>

1377
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:14.743
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're tied in with our </v>

1378
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:17.454
<v Speaker 1>allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Poland and with Canada and you </v>

1379
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives them access to us.</v>

1380
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So for someone on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look myself was trying to look at this.</v>

1381
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:25.763
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that while stealing stuff like </v>

1382
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 1>stealing stuff from us steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are they doing that?</v>

1383
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1384
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean the u s steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admittedly that was,</v>

1385
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 1>that was a pla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the People's Liberation Army,</v>

1386
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:38.860
<v Speaker 1>a third department operation against </v>
<v Speaker 1>dupont and,</v>

1387
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 1>and also against us steel and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a little bit different.</v>

1388
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I conflated the two.</v>

1389
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:43.944
<v Speaker 1>But Huawei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they do is by </v>

1390
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 1>having access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1391
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.283
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and embedding their equipment in your </v>

1392
00:54:50.341 --> 00:54:55.341
<v Speaker 1>communications infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives them the ability then to,</v>

1393
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1394
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:58.920
<v Speaker 1>in a simple way to tap in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1395
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just a package intercept </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1396
00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1397
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have communication.</v>

1398
00:55:02.741 --> 00:55:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So imagine we're trading information </v>
<v Speaker 1>through NATO,</v>

1399
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>

1400
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:09.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they need is that one in,</v>

1401
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1402
00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fishing,</v>

1403
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:12.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1404
00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1405
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 1>when hackers just an individual hacker </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in somebody's basement,</v>

1406
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just needs that one avenue.</v>

1407
00:55:17.131 --> 00:55:18.980
<v Speaker 1>He needs to get one s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1408
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 1>just click on that email that gives me </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pathway in.</v>

1409
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:22.913
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Huawei is able to embed their </v>

1410
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:25.014
<v Speaker 1>technology into Polish communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're now connected because of our </v>

1411
00:55:31.531 --> 00:55:34.320
<v Speaker 1>NATO alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives them access to us,</v>

1412
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whomever.</v>

1413
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if it just happened.</v>

1414
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:42.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if Huawei from a business </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective says,</v>

1415
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet we could sell some of our </v>

1416
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:45.420
<v Speaker 1>equipment and Poland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be good?</v>

1417
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.433
<v Speaker 1>The guy who was arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Huawei person who was arrested was </v>

1418
00:55:48.271 --> 00:55:50.380
<v Speaker 1>responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1419
00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:55.140
<v Speaker 1>the provision of telecommunication </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment to government facilities.</v>

1420
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.110
<v Speaker 1>That was his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy,</v>

1421
00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.003
<v Speaker 1>the Polish guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his last jobs with the Intel </v>

1422
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 1>service was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1423
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:03.960
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

1424
00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:06.973
<v Speaker 1>So I guess what I'm saying is none of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit happens in a bubble and it's </v>

1425
00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:11.250
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all very well mapped out.</v>

1426
00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:12.084
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese have a very long view on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and they are very good at </v>

1427
00:56:16.201 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 1>developing operations like this and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been very successful.</v>

1428
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll,</v>

1429
00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:22.321
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

1430
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:22.960
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1431
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that the current administration</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least is calling them out.</v>

1432
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's necessarily going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change their behavior,</v>

1433
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:28.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll,</v>

1434
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:29.614
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably get some sort of deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'll claim to look just a </v>

1435
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:32.943
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they agree with President Obama to stop </v>

1436
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.703
<v Speaker 1>their cyber shenanigans and they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just changed the way that they </v>

1437
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:41.750
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1438
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the world we live in.</v>

1439
00:56:43.121 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 1>But I think it is important to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>

1440
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1441
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some of that the tech people are</v>

1442
00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:50.670
<v Speaker 2>saying that they think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>

1443
00:56:50.671 --> 00:56:53.040
<v Speaker 2>When they were talking about the ban on </v>
<v Speaker 2>android phones,</v>

1444
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:55.590
<v Speaker 2>some of the tech people say that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make any sense,</v>

1445
00:56:55.591 --> 00:57:00.270
<v Speaker 2>but what you're saying is it goes far </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the actual phones itself.</v>

1446
00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:01.104
<v Speaker 2>And it's really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mission of the actual company </v>

1447
00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:04.884
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1448
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that,</v>

1449
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 1>that there is no way that Huawei and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other important</v>

1450
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies are solely privately </v>
<v Speaker 1>owned and,</v>

1451
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.593
<v Speaker 1>or have the ability to tell the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities that they will not spy on </v>

1452
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:22.670
<v Speaker 1>their behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just not happen.</v>

1453
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

1454
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.170
<v Speaker 1>you have to go a long ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1455
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.443
<v Speaker 1>to come up with that sort of naive </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint that says that a Chinese </v>

1456
00:57:33.521 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 1>company is going to put its foot down </v>
<v Speaker 1>until present g absolutely not.</v>

1457
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.780
<v Speaker 1>We will not do anything to harm another </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation's country or a company horse.</v>

1458
00:57:42.781 --> 00:57:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Shit they've spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've spent generations now decades,</v>

1459
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:47.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumpstarting their industry and moving </v>

1460
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:50.524
<v Speaker 1>up the food chain on the global economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>by hoovering up everything possible out </v>

1461
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:55.840
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone like a</v>

1462
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.380
<v Speaker 2>tech wizard got ahold of one of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>routers,</v>

1463
00:57:58.830 --> 00:57:59.663
<v Speaker 2>can have they been able to detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in there that doesn't belong </v>

1464
00:58:03.421 --> 00:58:06.780
<v Speaker 2>or some sort of a back door or some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a way that they could tap in.</v>

1465
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:08.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1466
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
<v Speaker 2>you were apple and you were sending data</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Raytheon or whatever and you're going</v>

1467
00:58:14.071 --> 00:58:16.950
<v Speaker 2>back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could tap in through that as it had</v>

1468
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:19.140
<v Speaker 2>been proven that there's a device like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1469
00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A former NSA director Mcconnell back in,</v>

1470
00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2015,</v>

1471
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.253
<v Speaker 1>I think early 2015 came out and NSA came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with an official statement and it </v>

1472
00:58:31.701 --> 00:58:36.701
<v Speaker 1>said every major US corporation of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence has been,</v>

1473
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1474
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.440
<v Speaker 1>attacked and exploited by Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have never,</v>

1475
00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:45.830
<v Speaker 1>ever not found Chinese malware within </v>
<v Speaker 1>their systems.</v>

1476
00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was ever four years</v>

1477
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.680
<v Speaker 2>malware being software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1478
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:52.460
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1479
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything in the hardware </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself?</v>

1480
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:56.291
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1481
00:58:56.291 --> 00:58:56.801
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1482
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:58.380
<v Speaker 1>in a sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1483
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1484
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:06.400
<v Speaker 1>in a sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember the name of it,</v>

1485
00:59:06.401 --> 00:59:08.580
<v Speaker 1>but not doing very good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1486
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.620
<v Speaker 1>if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1487
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 1>access to or understanding of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardware,</v>

1488
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 1>then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1489
00:59:20.291 --> 00:59:21.124
<v Speaker 1>affect easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can affect a physical control of </v>

1490
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:25.191
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1491
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:26.024
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1492
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:26.841
<v Speaker 1>stuxnet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

1493
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuxnet was exactly,</v>

1494
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.950
<v Speaker 1>it was an attack on Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1495
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the shut down their nuclear program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1496
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.790
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

1497
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially what it did was it took over</v>

1498
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:37.964
<v Speaker 1>control of some centrifuges over spawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them they heated about broke and it was </v>

1499
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 1>a virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

1500
00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it was an piece of software that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to impact the,</v>

1501
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:48.621
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1502
00:59:48.621 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>physical equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1503
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 1>it took control of those systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1504
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.670
<v Speaker 1>because in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1505
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 1>whoever perpetrated it had much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of that gear.</v>

1506
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or had access to that gear.</v>

1507
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an important part of,</v>

1508
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.843
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's happened several times since </v>

1509
01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

1510
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disclosing anything because it's</v>

1511
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>all it's been written about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it'll be a movie at some point,</v>

1512
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1513
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1514
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.073
<v Speaker 1>that's a concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm far more worried about a company </v>

1515
01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>like Huawei with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a integration into,</v>

1516
01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allied,</v>

1517
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our allies,</v>

1518
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.213
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telecommunications systems than I am </v>

1519
01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>about sort of the individual sale of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

1520
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that look,</v>

1521
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:32.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and all the others are gathering </v>

1522
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>more data on the average American then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1523
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>US government or anybody else's </v>

1524
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>government is doing it at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

1525
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>cause this is something that just came </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and we were trying to figure out with</v>

1526
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.953
<v Speaker 1>nonsense or not.</v>

1527
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:45.943
<v Speaker 1>My friend Adam was here the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about Toyota trucks </v>

1528
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't Google Toyota trucks just </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing it.</v>

1529
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:52.934
<v Speaker 1>And he said since then his mentions had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been filled with these little </v>

1530
01:00:56.241 --> 01:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>advertisements for Toyota trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>

1531
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you talk to Siri?</v>

1532
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.993
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1534
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simple voice rec recognition.</v>

1535
01:01:08.511 --> 01:01:08.901
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1536
01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a carry over from the old days of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>optical readers and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>we all thought it was incredible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take a piece of paper,</v>

1539
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:17.354
<v Speaker 1>put into a system and it would like take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that information that was on that piece </v>

1540
01:01:19.761 --> 01:01:22.820
<v Speaker 1>of paper and now it was on a database </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could access and manipulate.</v>

1541
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.991
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1542
01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:26.270
<v Speaker 1>voice recognition is no different in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that,</v>

1543
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1544
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>if for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had this switched on and it happens</v>

1545
01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:32.954
<v Speaker 1>to people on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure all the time walking around </v>

1546
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:35.114
<v Speaker 1>their house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something and all of a </v>

1547
01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>sudden Alexa will come on and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1548
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't find a result for that.</v>

1549
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>But do you want to listen to Ella </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fitzgerald or whatever?</v>

1550
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>It's always on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always listening,</v>

1551
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that with anything like </v>

1552
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>this TV right here if you want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few,</v>

1553
01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:50.143
<v Speaker 1>if I knew that TV was going to go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the office of the deputy foreign </v>

1554
01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>minister of a country hostile to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

1555
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I could turn that thing into a receiver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1556
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I could get my hands on that </v>

1557
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>before delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a wonderful thing.</v>

1558
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.493
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got this in there and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old days when you would have to go </v>

1559
01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>in on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entry operation and you know,</v>

1560
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you silent drills and put a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1561
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a device in the wall.</v>

1562
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>we've delivered a TV now I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

1564
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video too.</v>

1565
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for me.</v>

1566
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>So that Shit's always on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
01:02:24.231 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>

1568
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.063
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a regular phone that you get if you </v>

1569
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>just buy an iphone and you have Siri </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned on so we could say,</v>

1570
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:32.634
<v Speaker 1>Hey Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns on that phone is always </v>

1571
01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1572
01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then now we're getting in over my head,</v>

1573
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1574
01:02:41.681 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible?</v>

1575
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it capable of doing that?</v>

1576
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you do that?</v>

1577
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1578
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>as an intentional operation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1579
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it happening because apple wants to </v>

1580
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:54.924
<v Speaker 1>do it and they want to get better </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of consumer preferences </v>

1581
01:02:57.031 --> 01:02:57.864
<v Speaker 1>and things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea that that's above my pay </v>

1582
01:02:59.011 --> 01:02:59.844
<v Speaker 1>grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I will say from an operational </v>

1583
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:02.431
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1584
01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You from an operational perspective,</v>

1585
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:05.064
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like it would kind of be scandalous </v>

1586
01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>if we found out that apple is listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you say and then they're</v>

1587
01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:10.764
<v Speaker 1>sending them information to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and then they're trying to </v>

1588
01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>sell you whatever you were bringing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1589
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:15.421
<v Speaker 1>But it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1590
01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:16.254
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only one step above what they do </v>

1591
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1592
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go in here and I searched Toyota,</v>

1593
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:20.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1594
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the same situation.</v>

1595
01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking inundated with Toyota </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentions right after.</v>

1596
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1597
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the next iteration of that.</v>

1598
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:35.750
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that people would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1599
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that some folks would be outraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll bet people would just live with</v>

1600
01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1601
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 1>We seem to be willing to give up a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit,</v>

1602
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as we don't think that </v>

1603
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 1>governments doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

1604
01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>if it's google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's Google in somebody,</v>

1605
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>we seem to be fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's like,</v>

1606
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's at NSA,</v>

1607
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:57.240
<v Speaker 1>then now our best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not who's fucking making jack</v>

1608
01:03:57.241 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 1>off of these things.</v>

1609
01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:58.441
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1610
01:03:58.441 --> 01:03:59.274
<v Speaker 1>So it's Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google and all these companies that are </v>

1611
01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>using it to sell your data to make a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>

1612
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you got Jamie?</v>

1613
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Centers call for investigation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>T-mobile,</v>

1614
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.333
<v Speaker 1>sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verizon and att and t for selling </v>

1615
01:04:10.051 --> 01:04:14.640
<v Speaker 1>location data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phone companies know where you are.</v>

1616
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.953
<v Speaker 1>Lawmakers want them to stop selling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information until they could figure out </v>

1617
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>how to tax it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems,</v>

1618
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>what do they sell in that location?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Data for?</v>

1619
01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.580
<v Speaker 1>They want to know how many people are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain areas.</v>

1620
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:27.414
<v Speaker 1>Is that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the APP is telling you where </v>

1621
01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:28.854
<v Speaker 1>anyone could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can buy that information and find </v>

1622
01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:34.440
<v Speaker 1>anybody's a location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

1623
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>they do these things now where there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>billboard,</v>

1624
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>they'll put a billboard up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1625
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>in a square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1626
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll walk by and the billboard has</v>

1627
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>the ability to see where the eyeballs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1628
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1629
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So you'll look and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1630
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>it's looking at me that bill boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at me.</v>

1631
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's a success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1632
01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I've scored a hit or a view and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old days.</v>

1633
01:04:55.111 --> 01:04:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how you know,</v>

1634
01:04:56.251 --> 01:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>how many clicks or how many fields where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a camera.</v>

1635
01:04:59.060 --> 01:04:59.893
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ability for that billboard to </v>

1636
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:01.891
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1637
01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:02.724
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go overboard if I start talking </v>

1638
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:05.250
<v Speaker 1>technical and someone will call me out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

1639
01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly how it works.</v>

1640
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in simplistic terms,</v>

1641
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:09.511
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1642
01:05:09.511 --> 01:05:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it's an ability to monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1643
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>pedestrian traffic to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1644
01:05:16.531 --> 01:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's interests and to further refine</v>

1645
01:05:19.671 --> 01:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>so that they can sell a shit better.</v>

1646
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your outdoor advertising interactive,</v>

1647
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:25.500
<v Speaker 3>this is putting your phone directly up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>

1648
01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:28.850
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like you committing that Ooh,</v>

1649
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:29.703
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is also what he's talking </v>

1650
01:05:30.681 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 3>about to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he started with.</v>

1651
01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:34.220
<v Speaker 3>This guy's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name again?</v>

1652
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Who Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this you walk up to a phone that's in</v>

1653
01:05:39.051 --> 01:05:41.510
<v Speaker 3>the photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hold your phone up to it,</v>

1654
01:05:41.511 --> 01:05:42.344
<v Speaker 3>it sends a signal to your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's always Samsung knows </v>

1655
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.130
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only Samsung phones.</v>

1656
01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just a galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Add this advertisement.</v>

1657
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I have a song for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are galaxy ads,</v>

1658
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.400
<v Speaker 3>but if you can do a one way transaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that transaction can be two away easily,</v>

1659
01:05:55.401 --> 01:05:55.941
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1660
01:05:55.941 --> 01:05:58.320
<v Speaker 3>And it has to be to some degree because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be an exchange of,</v>

1661
01:05:58.590 --> 01:05:59.121
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1662
01:05:59.121 --> 01:05:59.954
<v Speaker 3>sort of a handshake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't know that billboards are </v>

1663
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>staring at you though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1664
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:03.771
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1665
01:06:03.771 --> 01:06:04.940
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a new,</v>

1666
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.170
<v Speaker 3>pretty crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1667
01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.004
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this you can tracking now understanding </v>

1668
01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:09.764
<v Speaker 3>where people are,</v>

1669
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>

1670
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1671
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>it used to be putting a beacon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1672
01:06:15.711 --> 01:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Investigations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1673
01:06:16.641 --> 01:06:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you put a beacon on a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1674
01:06:18.301 --> 01:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a little clumsy,</v>

1675
01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>but it got better and better as you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

1676
01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's now it's,</v>

1677
01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:23.361
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1678
01:06:23.361 --> 01:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty remarkable,</v>

1679
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but you can also think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronics that exist in a,</v>

1680
01:06:28.161 --> 01:06:30.610
<v Speaker 1>in a current vehicle and a new vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1681
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.633
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of those has a unique </v>

1682
01:06:32.751 --> 01:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether it's the tire pressure,</v>

1683
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicators,</v>

1684
01:06:36.501 --> 01:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you get in your car and it says your</v>

1685
01:06:38.091 --> 01:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>left front tire is low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1686
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a particular signal.</v>

1687
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>If I know that signal for that car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet I can find that car.</v>

1688
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1689
01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the same with all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronics that exist within a vehicle.</v>

1690
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:50.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just in the shit that we carry </v>

1691
01:06:52.881 --> 01:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've all got some kind of signature.</v>

1692
01:06:54.861 --> 01:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1693
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.433
<v Speaker 1>I think most people are willing to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a surprising amount of privacy for </v>

1694
01:07:01.131 --> 01:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because they're getting accustomed</v>

1695
01:07:03.261 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 1>to it and they're not shocked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting.</v>

1696
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were you saying today that somebody</v>

1697
01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:08.024
<v Speaker 3>made a slip up about phone calls?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the thing you were saying about </v>

1698
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:11.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1699
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:13.730
<v Speaker 3>the different data that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>collected.</v>

1700
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.070
<v Speaker 3>You were just telling me before the show</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the what?</v>

1701
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:19.923
<v Speaker 3>The some investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it that the thing that I was </v>

1702
01:07:23.281 --> 01:07:25.620
<v Speaker 3>just talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We find anybody's phone.</v>

1703
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:26.603
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying that through the emails </v>

1704
01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.740
<v Speaker 3>and phone up phone calls and the guide </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up by saying phone calls.</v>

1705
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a brain a he just told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the show.</v>

1706
01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:41.140
<v Speaker 3>But then thinking about a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking a lot of stuff.</v>

1707
01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of shit on my mind right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain with that.</v>

1708
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.353
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm still thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallway thing we were talking about </v>

1709
01:07:47.871 --> 01:07:48.780
<v Speaker 3>right before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you remember it.</v>

1710
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.203
<v Speaker 3>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it had something to do with the </v>

1711
01:07:50.841 --> 01:07:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Mueller investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think wins that can end fuck</v>

1713
01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.433
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that means he would scare the </v>

1714
01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:02.920
<v Speaker 3>shit out of me if he was looking at my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1715
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Cause it seems like that guy takes his </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1716
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.550
<v Speaker 3>but about two years of worth of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I've got,</v>

1717
01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:12.120
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was the national security </v>
<v Speaker 3>adviser on CNN last night.</v>

1718
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.060
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about Bill Barr is,</v>

1719
01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the access to information he would </v>

1720
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 4>already have and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it'll also be gaining,</v>

1721
01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I guess by becoming the Attorney </v>
<v Speaker 4>General.</v>

1722
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.450
<v Speaker 4>They were discussing whether he will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1723
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to share all the information coming out.</v>

1724
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:31.010
<v Speaker 4>They wanted them to commit to doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1725
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:31.844
<v Speaker 4>And it was just sort of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't commit because I don't know </v>

1726
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:34.304
<v Speaker 4>what's in there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were just sort of like giving </v>

1727
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:37.340
<v Speaker 4>their both their sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1728
01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:38.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could know what he would know,</v>

1729
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 4>what he will know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I was sort of saying.</v>

1730
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:42.344
<v Speaker 4>And he sorta cut himself off of sharing </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how much information this guy </v>

1731
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:47.990
<v Speaker 4>might have access to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sort of,</v>

1732
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.460
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was,</v>

1733
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:52.190
<v Speaker 4>the former national security advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe was all that was.</v>

1734
01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.673
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared of was that the NSA was building </v>

1735
01:08:56.831 --> 01:08:57.664
<v Speaker 1>some gigantic place somewhere outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salt Lake where they would store every </v>

1736
01:09:02.231 --> 01:09:06.700
<v Speaker 1>single phone call that you ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single email.</v>

1737
01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1738
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.430
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1739
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.880
<v Speaker 1>that there was that whole stink at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point about,</v>

1740
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were actually holding on to,</v>

1741
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.113
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The collection of information and there </v>

1742
01:09:17.081 --> 01:09:21.130
<v Speaker 1>was some misreporting about how they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually got your phone calls,</v>

1743
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:21.821
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got us,</v>

1744
01:09:21.821 --> 01:09:24.820
<v Speaker 1>they've got number and duration of call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1745
01:09:24.821 --> 01:09:25.654
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the key pieces of information </v>

1746
01:09:26.711 --> 01:09:28.210
<v Speaker 1>that they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1747
01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.190
<v Speaker 1>could they at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1748
01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.370
<v Speaker 1>suddenly decide you're a target of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest and so we won't,</v>

1749
01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.440
<v Speaker 1>we will start collecting on your calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:39.210
<v Speaker 1>But was the NSA gathering everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone conversations now,</v>

1751
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.490
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be a thing that you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to wire tap somebody.</v>

1752
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going after the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a dad install a bug,</v>

1753
01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.620
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1754
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:49.091
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1755
01:09:49.091 --> 01:09:49.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1756
01:09:49.391 --> 01:09:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean tech technology now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1757
01:09:50.831 --> 01:09:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I remember the old days of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1758
01:09:52.061 --> 01:09:52.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operations,</v>

1759
01:09:52.991 --> 01:09:53.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1760
01:09:53.441 --> 01:09:54.910
<v Speaker 1>if we wanted to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're overseas,</v>

1761
01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:55.763
<v Speaker 1>it's compounded incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's May really difficult to do </v>

1762
01:09:58.271 --> 01:10:00.520
<v Speaker 1>observation posts and listening posts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything overseas,</v>

1763
01:10:00.521 --> 01:10:01.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's not your turf.</v>

1764
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to come up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an air tight plan,</v>

1765
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but it was the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still had to get physical access,</v>

1766
01:10:08.531 --> 01:10:10.930
<v Speaker 1>right to phone lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had that yet the clip off and you had</v>

1767
01:10:10.931 --> 01:10:11.471
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1768
01:10:11.471 --> 01:10:12.760
<v Speaker 1>then you have to figure out where am I </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the,</v>

1769
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I going to put the batteries?</v>

1770
01:10:14.531 --> 01:10:15.670
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to store this shit?</v>

1771
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 1>And then you got listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1772
01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>

1773
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.530
<v Speaker 1>what happens is it starts collecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1774
01:10:20.531 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 1>You start getting mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tapes,</v>

1775
01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:23.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not getting it real time,</v>

1776
01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:25.720
<v Speaker 1>which is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nowadays,</v>

1777
01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:26.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely different.</v>

1778
01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

1779
01:10:29.111 --> 01:10:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1780
01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:35.320
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we look at today's concerns,</v>

1781
01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:36.154
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at what are people worried </v>

1782
01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:39.850
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should they be worried about?</v>

1783
01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that privacy always comes up.</v>

1784
01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:45.670
<v Speaker 1>People always talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I keep going back to my same</v>

1785
01:10:45.671 --> 01:10:46.504
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was I,</v>

1786
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't see people with pitchforks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the torches going down a complainant,</v>

1787
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1788
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's collecting massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>data or you know,</v>

1789
01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:58.063
<v Speaker 1>t mobile and sprint and all of these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mapping our locations as we move </v>

1790
01:11:00.401 --> 01:11:02.320
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see it.</v>

1791
01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably raised nobody's interest </v>

1792
01:11:04.451 --> 01:11:05.470
<v Speaker 1>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1793
01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>that article that you just pulled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1794
01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1795
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.533
<v Speaker 1>I guess in part it's because we become </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of used to it become accustomed to </v>

1796
01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1797
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.863
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1798
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should we be worried about?</v>

1799
01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:18.414
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what we should boy up </v>

1800
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:19.703
<v Speaker 1>mostly is a state sponsored activity by </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries whose interests almost never </v>

1801
01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:28.500
<v Speaker 1>aligned with ours now would include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China certainly includes Russia,</v>

1802
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:30.110
<v Speaker 1>was Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1803
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.920
<v Speaker 1>the shit that they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has a policy,</v>

1804
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:36.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information domination,</v>

1805
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:37.743
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means they've determined that the </v>

1806
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:44.220
<v Speaker 1>next war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next modern large scale war is going</v>

1807
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>to be one by whoever has control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1808
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So where are they putting all their </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources?</v>

1809
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>China knows that they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a military that's going to be able</v>

1810
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 1>to reach around the globe for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

1811
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:54.901
<v Speaker 1>Although they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1812
01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 1>they're beefing up their resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

1813
01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:59.820
<v Speaker 1>It's cyber and it's space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1814
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.773
<v Speaker 1>So I know a lot of people were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were kicking the president in the ass </v>

1815
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 1>and laughing about space for us because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is funny,</v>

1816
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the uniforms would be amazing.</v>

1817
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about this,</v>

1818
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.943
<v Speaker 1>but China honestly believes and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting their resources into cyber and </v>

1819
01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:15.330
<v Speaker 1>to space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean,</v>

1820
01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:16.203
<v Speaker 1>wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're anti satellite technology that </v>

1821
01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:20.340
<v Speaker 1>they've been developing and working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and continue to work on.</v>

1822
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:21.593
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of that is to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of communications and </v>

1823
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:27.660
<v Speaker 1>surveillance abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's ours or allies in the event</v>

1824
01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:28.494
<v Speaker 1>of something major that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would have the ability to shut </v>

1825
01:12:31.141 --> 01:12:32.430
<v Speaker 1>off our silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1826
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what does that mean?</v>

1827
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means you're blind,</v>

1828
01:12:35.341 --> 01:12:36.174
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And will suddenly walking around with </v>

1829
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.360
<v Speaker 1>compasses and maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1830
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.730
<v Speaker 1>trying to shoot an asthma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then figuring out where the hell,</v>

1831
01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the target is.</v>

1832
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.883
<v Speaker 1>So China is currently developing that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have developed something that </v>

1833
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.760
<v Speaker 1>they're working on it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 1>They're working on now developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They developed some of it.</v>

1835
01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:50.643
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working to get the next </v>

1836
01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:52.014
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like every nation that has the </v>

1837
01:12:53.131 --> 01:12:56.160
<v Speaker 1>resources and ability understands that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is doing the same.</v>

1838
01:12:56.161 --> 01:13:00.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is their excuse was they should,</v>

1839
01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

1840
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.020
<v Speaker 1>they understand they have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1841
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they,</v>

1842
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.610
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1843
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as it don't use it right.</v>

1844
01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And in an illegal way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the right to develop the tech.</v>

1845
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.943
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no treaty that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't develop anti satellite </v>

1846
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:14.551
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1847
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:15.050
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1848
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>there's the start treaties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the nuclear,</v>

1849
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions that we have with Russia,</v>

1850
01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:22.410
<v Speaker 1>which isn't a whole nother interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic because we're now arguing with the</v>

1851
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Russians over over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1852
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:25.203
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest nuke agreement that took </v>

1853
01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:28.470
<v Speaker 1>place some time ago.</v>

1854
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1855
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:32.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up for renewal sometime soon,</v>

1856
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:33.203
<v Speaker 1>your a year or two years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Russians had been cheating on a </v>

1857
01:13:36.451 --> 01:13:37.284
<v Speaker 1>previous agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're know now they tried to say </v>

1858
01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 1>we're cheating on the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an interesting thing to be</v>

1859
01:13:41.521 --> 01:13:42.354
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being is that there's </v>

1860
01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:49.491
<v Speaker 1>conventions that try to control the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers for warheads or for delivery</v>

1861
01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:51.750
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles or,</v>

1862
01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:52.411
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1863
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>submarines,</v>

1864
01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:57.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for this new world.</v>

1865
01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:57.983
<v Speaker 1>Cyberspace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pentagon's still trying to figure </v>

1866
01:13:58.861 --> 01:13:59.730
<v Speaker 1>out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1867
01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:01.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war,</v>

1868
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>means in cyberspace,</v>

1869
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.930
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1870
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 1>how do you respond?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you know,</v>

1871
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:06.780
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the threshold,</v>

1872
01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what's an appropriate response?</v>

1873
01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1874
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll get there.</v>

1875
01:14:12.071 --> 01:14:12.904
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll start having these </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions and create treaties that </v>

1876
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:16.060
<v Speaker 1>will allow that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right now,</v>

1877
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>from China's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1878
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:18.754
<v Speaker 1>not to beat on China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm much more concerned about China </v>

1879
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.390
<v Speaker 1>for our national security.</v>

1880
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>There are a much bigger concern than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is.</v>

1881
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Russia is punching above its weight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potent,</v>

1882
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's a Dick,</v>

1883
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1884
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And they've doing what they always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is metal and democracy.</v>

1885
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's been their methodology for ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>since they've been around.</v>

1886
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:39.003
<v Speaker 1>But you know that that's small potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the GDP of a small European </v>

1887
01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1888
01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and when the oil prices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>are in the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are sucking wind.</v>

1890
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:50.103
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta be concerned with Russia and </v>

1891
01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:53.500
<v Speaker 1>understand that their interests were </v>
<v Speaker 1>never aligned with ours.</v>

1892
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part may be,</v>

1893
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 1>we tried to imagine they were with Syria</v>
<v Speaker 1>and isis and everything,</v>

1894
01:14:58.690 --> 01:14:59.523
<v Speaker 1>but Russia is only interested there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining their leverage and </v>

1895
01:15:01.091 --> 01:15:01.924
<v Speaker 1>increasing it and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not losing their military foothold </v>

1896
01:15:04.091 --> 01:15:06.490
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their primary interest.</v>

1897
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 1>We mirror our values and we mirror our </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest on other countries.</v>

1898
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And so we imagined that somehow we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all in this fight against Isis together.</v>

1899
01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1900
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1901
01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.613
<v Speaker 1>China's a much bigger issue and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should be focused on that and to </v>

1902
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:25.510
<v Speaker 1>some degree this administration is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's where I say,</v>

1903
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:26.344
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just keep complaining and </v>

1904
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 1>bitching and moaning because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like president trump.</v>

1905
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:31.603
<v Speaker 1>There are certain things that are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that you should be willing to say </v>

1906
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:34.181
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1907
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.610
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I don't like the messenger,</v>

1908
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but that part of it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it his personal life?</v>

1909
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:41.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was it because of his dealings</v>
<v Speaker 1>with China from the business world that </v>

1910
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>he understands it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's more concerned with the,</v>

1911
01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 1>the imbalance of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade.</v>

1912
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened was what do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is speculation,</v>

1913
01:15:54.971 --> 01:15:55.804
<v Speaker 1>so hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect that what happened was he </v>

1914
01:15:58.211 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 1>came into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1915
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.960
<v Speaker 1>focused on the trade imbalance.</v>

1916
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:03.063
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he was sitting there and talking </v>

1917
01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:06.064
<v Speaker 1>about the trade balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the conversation from the </v>

1918
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 1>National Security Council and from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agency and others in terms of saying,</v>

1919
01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:13.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1920
01:16:13.271 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the reason why and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the long longterm effects of,</v>

1921
01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:17.543
<v Speaker 1>of their theft of intellectual property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why in part they've been </v>

1922
01:16:19.511 --> 01:16:20.344
<v Speaker 1>successful in these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there was probably more and </v>

1923
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 1>more discussion talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1924
01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.200
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1925
01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 1>economic espionage and theft of Ip and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that became then an issue for him.</v>

1926
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think initially,</v>

1927
01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:33.604
<v Speaker 1>and still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the big issue is just he wants </v>

1928
01:16:35.501 --> 01:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>to try to create a win in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade imbalance.</v>

1929
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Russia seems to us here domestically </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaks,</v>

1930
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>speaking from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for myself,</v>

1931
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:46.330
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think about it,</v>

1932
01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:47.164
<v Speaker 1>and I think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the narrative that's been sort of </v>

1933
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:53.140
<v Speaker 1>delivered to us said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is this military danger.</v>

1934
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>We're worried about Putin taking over </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>

1935
01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:00.670
<v Speaker 1>We're worried about Putin's power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he kills dissidence,</v>

1936
01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:04.180
<v Speaker 1>the way he kills political opponents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

1937
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:05.583
<v Speaker 1>we think about China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even with the walway arrests were </v>

1938
01:17:08.651 --> 01:17:09.484
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1939
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:10.483
<v Speaker 1>no one seems to be concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to light any bulbs over </v>

1940
01:17:14.511 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're right.</v>

1941
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except,</v>

1942
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin is more like a thug and he's a </v>

1943
01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:21.280
<v Speaker 1>visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1944
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:22.011
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

1945
01:17:22.011 --> 01:17:22.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1946
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1947
01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.693
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been very clear about wanting to </v>

1948
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.174
<v Speaker 1>try to rebuild the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether it's Crimea and the </v>

1949
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:28.844
<v Speaker 1>annexation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or where they're taking over eastern </v>

1950
01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1951
01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1952
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.510
<v Speaker 1>or maintaining a position at Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1953
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1954
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:38.090
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1955
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his attacks or the FSB is attacks </v>

1956
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.630
<v Speaker 1>overseas against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1957
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.940
<v Speaker 1>dissidents and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1958
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just more in your face.</v>

1959
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.090
<v Speaker 1>He's like Tony Soprano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1960
01:17:48.091 --> 01:17:49.190
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can look at that.</v>

1961
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:50.720
<v Speaker 1>China's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1962
01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>sort of this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1963
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:53.870
<v Speaker 1>And she look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's fantastic.</v>

1964
01:17:53.871 --> 01:17:55.550
<v Speaker 1>The history is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1965
01:17:55.551 --> 01:17:58.280
<v Speaker 1>the places are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1966
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be trading with China.</v>

1967
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 1>We should be doing a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business with China.</v>

1968
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 1>We should clear the decks and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>

1969
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.143
<v Speaker 1>We can level the playing field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should also be pragmatic and </v>

1970
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 1>realize what they do in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>theft of Ip.</v>

1971
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.160
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1972
01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 1>because that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably won't change,</v>

1973
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:15.614
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we absolutely should be dealing with </v>

1974
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:18.224
<v Speaker 1>China all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that they've always kind of </v>

1975
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 1>been viewed more in more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated fashion,</v>

1976
01:18:23.631 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe because Putin has just sort of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your face.</v>

1977
01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

1978
01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's good at it.</v>

1979
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.190
<v Speaker 1>He's very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he's a smart son of a bitch,</v>

1980
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's pretty easy to read,</v>

1981
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:34.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1982
01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.550
<v Speaker 1>he's thuggish and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1983
01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:37.850
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1984
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.190
<v Speaker 1>he longs for those days of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

1985
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:41.743
<v Speaker 1>So we should understand that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>he does is because of that is because </v>

1986
01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1987
01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.960
<v Speaker 1>he would love to rebuild the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

1988
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:49.423
<v Speaker 1>And so we shouldn't be surprised by any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of aggressive move that he makes </v>

1989
01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:55.160
<v Speaker 1>against his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his neighbors.</v>

1990
01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:57.320
<v Speaker 1>And we should always push back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1991
01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this administration,</v>

1992
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:02.983
<v Speaker 1>not to beat their drum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actions they've taken against </v>

1993
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:06.914
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that you've got people </v>

1994
01:19:08.481 --> 01:19:09.314
<v Speaker 1>calling him a puppet of Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are more significant than the </v>

1995
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.480
<v Speaker 1>previous administration took?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1996
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:17.690
<v Speaker 1>what has he done the sanctions against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1997
01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>key individuals and companies within </v>

1998
01:19:19.911 --> 01:19:20.744
<v Speaker 1>Russia as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the toughest sanctions have </v>

1999
01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 1>been placed on Russia ever.</v>

2000
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the provision of weapons and a,</v>

2001
01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:29.960
<v Speaker 1>and assistance to the Ukrainians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2002
01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:31.360
<v Speaker 1>That was something the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration said,</v>

2003
01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:32.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to do that.</v>

2004
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we don't,</v>

2005
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:36.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't want any blow back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2006
01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing,</v>

2007
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be done.</v>

2008
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing back against them on the,</v>

2009
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 1>on the 2011 nuke a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2010
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:46.101
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sorry,</v>

2011
01:19:46.101 --> 01:19:47.090
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the previous,</v>

2012
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:50.540
<v Speaker 1>on the start deal prior to the 2011 deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and calling them out and saying,</v>

2013
01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:52.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're cheating on this and you,</v>

2014
01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be held accountable.</v>

2015
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things there that,</v>

2016
01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:02.470
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense then that don't add up </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to somebody who says,</v>

2017
01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an absolute puppet,</v>

2018
01:20:04.101 --> 01:20:04.551
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2019
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:05.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a puppet,</v>

2020
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>so why is he doing certain that seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter to Russian interests?</v>

2021
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2022
01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:14.280
<v Speaker 1>because he's smart and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to get caught out.</v>

2023
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I ain't see it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's playing,</v>

2024
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.650
<v Speaker 1>he's playing long game here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2025
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:18.460
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2026
01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:19.440
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>

2027
01:20:19.441 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2028
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

2029
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2030
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:23.243
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2031
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:24.263
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't strapped on my tin foil hat </v>

2032
01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:28.170
<v Speaker 1>yet to get to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

2033
01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:29.101
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2034
01:20:29.101 --> 01:20:29.934
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a complicated one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have some compromising </v>

2035
01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:34.830
<v Speaker 1>information about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was always the fear,</v>

2036
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:35.664
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that they knew something or maybe it </v>

2037
01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:40.560
<v Speaker 1>was business dealings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was people peeing on him or,</v>

2038
01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll get that if they had,</v>

2039
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:43.560
<v Speaker 1>if they did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2040
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:46.820
<v Speaker 1>anything I can help in today's world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything's possible.</v>

2041
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wish we had somebody else in there</v>

2042
01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:53.910
<v Speaker 1>who was more elegant and eloquent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and anybody stand out?</v>

2043
01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not right now.</v>

2044
01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:58.043
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's going to </v>

2045
01:20:58.641 --> 01:20:59.940
<v Speaker 1>challenge it from the Republican side.</v>

2046
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.773
<v Speaker 1>And on the democratic side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to get 18 to 20 </v>

2047
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:04.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential candidates and there and beat </v>

2048
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>in their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2049
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be a real,</v>

2050
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slug fest and as they're trying to </v>

2051
01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:14.160
<v Speaker 1>establish someone who's a viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>

2052
01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 1>kind of like what the Republicans did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2053
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 1>And we ended up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2054
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.700
<v Speaker 1>we ended up with president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know how the Democrats,</v>

2055
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 1>if they're not careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can end up with the same thing.</v>

2056
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about Joe Biden.</v>

2057
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Biden's an excellent cat.</v>

2058
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 150 years old,</v>

2059
01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:29.280
<v Speaker 1>it's 150 years old and he lost twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2060
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 1>But everybody loves the person that's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bench,</v>

2061
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:31.981
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2062
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Until they get in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2063
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows where they're going to go with</v>

2064
01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2065
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could they had this idea that they've </v>

2066
01:21:40.681 --> 01:21:42.210
<v Speaker 1>got compromising information on them?</v>

2067
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

2068
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think is that if Mueller </v>

2069
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:52.590
<v Speaker 1>has figured this out right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's been quiet about it,</v>

2070
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:53.424
<v Speaker 1>and then the most remarkable thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this investigation will be that nobody </v>

2071
01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.020
<v Speaker 1>leaked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2072
01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't keep a secret in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

2073
01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that for two years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have like that,</v>

2074
01:22:06.691 --> 01:22:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bullet,</v>

2075
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:09.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they think they are going to come </v>

2076
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:13.410
<v Speaker 1>up with some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My inclination is to think that,</v>

2077
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Molly's gonna Finish this investigation </v>

2078
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.300
<v Speaker 1>issue some findings and nobody's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be happy,</v>

2079
01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:19.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there won't be a bullet.</v>

2080
01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:20.963
<v Speaker 1>And so the left won't be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right won't be happy because he'll </v>

2081
01:22:23.311 --> 01:22:24.950
<v Speaker 1>still be pointing out the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

2082
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

2083
01:22:25.951 --> 01:22:26.784
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid moves on the campaigns part and </v>

2084
01:22:28.081 --> 01:22:29.010
<v Speaker 1>that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2085
01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:30.680
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate activity by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2086
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.100
<v Speaker 1>people like manafort and others.</v>

2087
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2088
01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:35.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I think there's gonna be some smoking</v>

2089
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.653
<v Speaker 1>gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2090
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my reason for saying that is because</v>

2091
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I've never known Washington not be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep or to,</v>

2092
01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>to be able to keep a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one,</v>

2093
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:45.474
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mueller ever done one of these things </v>

2094
01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:48.450
<v Speaker 1>before though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems uniquely calculated.</v>

2095
01:22:48.451 --> 01:22:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2096
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.270
<v Speaker 1>he's done this before and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has,</v>

2097
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:51.661
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2098
01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:53.940
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart guy and a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seasoned,</v>

2099
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.010
<v Speaker 1>a operator investigator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2100
01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:56.853
<v Speaker 1>and he's got good people working for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's absolutely correct to let them </v>

2101
01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:02.430
<v Speaker 1>go with this and just let him finish it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2102
01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when is that going to be?</v>

2103
01:23:04.831 --> 01:23:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2104
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:06.383
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had,</v>

2105
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:07.661
<v Speaker 1>they've been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2106
01:23:07.661 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>he's going to wrap it up next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's going to wrap it up this week.</v>

2107
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>He's going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

2108
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

2109
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking he's going to wrap it up.</v>

2110
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This literally could go onto in the eye,</v>

2111
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.660
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have to end before </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably end of this year.</v>

2112
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think even he's gonna want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>for political calculations,</v>

2113
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.490
<v Speaker 1>let it go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to close to 20,</v>

2114
01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:26.200
<v Speaker 1>20 in the election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2115
01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.034
<v Speaker 1>So regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't think he's a </v>

2116
01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:29.374
<v Speaker 1>particularly political individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to see the wisdom of </v>

2117
01:23:31.631 --> 01:23:33.980
<v Speaker 1>wrapping it up before then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2118
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>and then letting the chips fall wherever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

2119
01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:40.070
<v Speaker 2>What's astonishing to me is how anytime </v>
<v Speaker 2>something does come out on trump,</v>

2120
01:23:40.071 --> 01:23:42.680
<v Speaker 2>it just seems to slide right off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that is true.</v>

2122
01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:45.413
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think what's happening is </v>

2123
01:23:47.191 --> 01:23:49.230
<v Speaker 1>they're just throwing everything out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there every day.</v>

2124
01:23:49.231 --> 01:23:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it much like,</v>

2125
01:23:51.001 --> 01:23:51.834
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our willingness to give up privacy </v>

2126
01:23:52.771 --> 01:23:53.604
<v Speaker 1>because we keep hearing about another </v>
<v Speaker 1>hack or another lake or we know that </v>

2127
01:23:56.911 --> 01:23:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's doing this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think w,</v>

2128
01:23:59.130 --> 01:23:59.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that constant drum beat and that </v>

2129
01:24:01.201 --> 01:24:03.810
<v Speaker 1>mudslinging and I think the dems haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>done themselves any favors.</v>

2130
01:24:03.811 --> 01:24:05.790
<v Speaker 1>So the resistance movement of what do we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to call it?</v>

2131
01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think people are just immune </v>

2132
01:24:08.311 --> 01:24:12.570
<v Speaker 1>to it and it's hardened the trump's base</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think,</v>

2133
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's under attack every minute,</v>

2134
01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.780
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I gotta support them harder.</v>

2135
01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2136
01:24:18.001 --> 01:24:18.781
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2137
01:24:18.781 --> 01:24:21.420
<v Speaker 1>who do you think's going to end up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the race?</v>

2138
01:24:21.450 --> 01:24:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got the best chance?</v>

2139
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:25.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2140
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.130
<v Speaker 2>on the left hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2141
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:29.210
<v Speaker 2>my real fear is that Hillary is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>run again.</v>

2142
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost did one of those TV spit takes.</v>

2143
01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2144
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.130
<v Speaker 2>that lady is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2145
01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.830
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that she said in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the more recent interviews,</v>

2146
01:24:39.831 --> 01:24:41.720
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be president.</v>

2147
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.883
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just what do you want to put it on your </v>

2148
01:24:46.011 --> 01:24:48.440
<v Speaker 2>resume?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck does that mean?</v>

2149
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I could do a great job and </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning this country around.</v>

2150
01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I have the leadership ability to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect a change.</v>

2151
01:24:55.770 --> 01:24:56.081
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2152
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:57.620
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be president,</v>

2153
01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some time I could do that.</v>

2154
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2155
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:02.521
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2156
01:25:02.521 --> 01:25:03.600
<v Speaker 1>and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She May,</v>

2157
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:04.853
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there's going to be so much </v>

2158
01:25:06.151 --> 01:25:09.060
<v Speaker 1>pressure on her from the party to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2159
01:25:09.061 --> 01:25:09.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2160
01:25:09.721 --> 01:25:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I think she's going to look at that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2161
01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.083
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no chance I can rally the </v>

2162
01:25:12.811 --> 01:25:14.820
<v Speaker 1>apparatus around me like I did the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2163
01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.750
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2164
01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:19.350
<v Speaker 1>because even she can't run without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

2165
01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:20.041
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2166
01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to figure that out.</v>

2167
01:25:22.021 --> 01:25:22.710
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2168
01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:23.543
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if she has so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that owe her favors and she's so deeply </v>

2169
01:25:28.441 --> 01:25:31.230
<v Speaker 2>entrenched in the world that she could </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow,</v>

2170
01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:35.040
<v Speaker 2>or another muster up enough support to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give it one more shot.</v>

2171
01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2172
01:25:36.251 --> 01:25:36.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

2173
01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:37.550
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2174
01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.413
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you're talking about hurry it </v>

2175
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:42.370
<v Speaker 1>all the way to two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What to to,</v>

2176
01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kamala Harris,</v>

2177
01:25:43.461 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 1>cory booker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tulsi Gabbert Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi.</v>

2178
01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Gabbard Castro is a veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young makes a lot of sense.</v>

2179
01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate.</v>

2180
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:54.243
<v Speaker 2>I think she has a real legitimate chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting people excited about a real </v>

2181
01:25:57.131 --> 01:25:59.120
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:25:59.150 --> 01:25:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not,</v>

2183
01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2184
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time we're close.</v>

2185
01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.160
<v Speaker 1>We're getting to that point where we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2186
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:06.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we end up with a female president and </v>

2187
01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for us.</v>

2188
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got no problems.</v>

2189
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:10.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2190
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it would actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2191
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it would turn the ship in a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

2192
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the policies are good,</v>

2193
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as we're not,</v>

2194
01:26:18.801 --> 01:26:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veering off into,</v>

2195
01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:23.640
<v Speaker 1>sort of socialist policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2197
01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:24.483
<v Speaker 1>land and thinking somehow we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>all going to end up with a universal </v>

2198
01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 1>basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2199
01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I got a guy coming on and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2200
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

2201
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 2>describe universal basic income and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefits would be.</v>

2202
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:35.803
<v Speaker 2>The reason being that they're worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>that automation is going to kill a </v>

2203
01:26:38.631 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 2>gigantic percent is of jobs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing,</v>

2204
01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 2>fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2205
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.393
<v Speaker 2>medical field trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things that </v>

2206
01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.373
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income might actually be</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we need it certain point </v>

2207
01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:58.850
<v Speaker 2>in time because so many jobs will go </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and go away so rapidly.</v>

2208
01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills motivation?</v>

2209
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:05.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I thought was maybe,</v>

2210
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:10.070
<v Speaker 2>but maybe if the motivation is not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to survive,</v>

2211
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but the motivation to succeed and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2212
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.113
<v Speaker 2>it would get people to do what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually want to do for a living or </v>

2213
01:27:17.211 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 2>chase down what they actually want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get them motivated to,</v>

2214
01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:23.390
<v Speaker 2>to have a better life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just motivated to live,</v>

2215
01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.400
<v Speaker 2>follow their passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2216
01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:26.943
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because when you give people </v>

2217
01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:30.320
<v Speaker 2>things for nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2218
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 2>You generally do kill their motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2219
01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:36.590
<v Speaker 2>you look neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look no further than trust fund kids.</v>

2220
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.911
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2221
01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:38.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>

2222
01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:39.560
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great example.</v>

2223
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Most people would go towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2224
01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:41.533
<v Speaker 2>welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're right on the other </v>

2225
01:27:42.711 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 2>end of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

2226
01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:45.494
<v Speaker 2>trust fund kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this list lists way they </v>

2227
01:27:49.761 --> 01:27:51.470
<v Speaker 2>approach life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2228
01:27:51.471 --> 01:27:52.304
<v Speaker 2>they just laissez faire just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that it's really hard for </v>

2229
01:27:58.251 --> 01:28:03.251
<v Speaker 2>people to want something better when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have enough.</v>

2230
01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:04.820
<v Speaker 2>They're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Everything's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to do anything.</v>

2232
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:10.940
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have to motivate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do anything to get that money.</v>

2233
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:11.773
<v Speaker 1>Mani.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2235
01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:13.724
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2236
01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the logistics behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2237
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how it gets paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual numbers.</v>

2238
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part that I,</v>

2239
01:28:19.801 --> 01:28:24.740
<v Speaker 1>that worries me is this issue of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of motivation and ensuring that then,</v>

2240
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's willing to unmask the sofa </v>

2241
01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:29.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do something productive.</v>

2242
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:30.321
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just,</v>

2243
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:31.154
<v Speaker 1>we can't be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nation of people following their </v>

2244
01:28:33.651 --> 01:28:34.484
<v Speaker 1>passion because their passion is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is completely unpredicted or may make </v>

2245
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:39.700
<v Speaker 1>making dream catchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pottery loved pottery month.</v>

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:41.120
<v Speaker 3>What do you think happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2312
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.510
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's explain what happened.</v>

2313
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:44.340
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he was,</v>

2314
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:47.220
<v Speaker 3>he was a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was embedded in,</v>

2315
01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.660
<v Speaker 3>was it in Iraq during the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the war.</v>

2316
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.740
<v Speaker 3>He was writing a story for the role for </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling stone.</v>

2317
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:58.320
<v Speaker 3>And he was writing about which general </v>
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Crystal.</v>

2320
01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:08.680

<v Speaker 2>while this happened,</v>

2321
01:32:08.681 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 2>the Iceland volcano went off.</v>

2322
01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 2>they suspended air travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was stuck there far longer than he</v>

2323
01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 2>was supposed to be and people got </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with this guy being around.</v>

2324
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they behave the way they behave.</v>

2325
01:32:22.241 --> 01:32:23.074
<v Speaker 2>They made some jokes about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He apparently made some jokes about </v>

2326
01:32:26.231 --> 01:32:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy put this,</v>

2327
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Michael Hastings put all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling stone.</v>

2328
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wound up being a huge scandal.</v>

2329
01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:37.053
<v Speaker 2>Mcchrystal had to step down and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a lot of people that hated that guy </v>

2330
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:47.340
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people loved mcchrystal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a highly respected general.</v>

2331
01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2332
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:53.110
<v Speaker 2>He had a step down from his position and</v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing you know,</v>

2333
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.513
<v Speaker 2>x amount of time later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy drives his car 150 miles an </v>

2334
01:32:59.201 --> 01:33:00.310
<v Speaker 2>hour into a tree.</v>

2335
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.280
<v Speaker 2>It blows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The engine goes flying the whole deal.</v>

2336
01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy theory was that there was</v>

2337
01:33:07.571 --> 01:33:09.040
<v Speaker 2>a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he had a brand new Mercedes,</v>

2338
01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:14.220
<v Speaker 2>there was a way that they could take </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the controls of your vehicle,</v>

2339
01:33:15.011 --> 01:33:17.530
<v Speaker 2>the acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the braking steering,</v>

2340
01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:21.130
<v Speaker 2>and they could do all this remotely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they put something in your car,</v>

2341
01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:21.964
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could get ahold of this </v>

2342
01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:24.244
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could turn that television to a </v>

2343
01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:26.434
<v Speaker 2>receiver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2344
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.513
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that is possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could have gotten a hold of his </v>

2345
01:33:30.881 --> 01:33:33.820
<v Speaker 2>car and made him suicide himself?</v>

2346
01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two parts to it.</v>

2347
01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>

2348
01:33:37.931 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that you can take control</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a vehicle,</v>

2349
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:41.530
<v Speaker 1>a modern vehicle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2350
01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that,</v>

2351
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:44.130
<v Speaker 1>not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the woody,</v>

2352
01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:44.981
<v Speaker 1>not the woody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2353
01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:46.480
<v Speaker 1>we call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2354
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:47.343
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2355
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:48.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

2356
01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:49.354
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely possible that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take those is no two ways about </v>

2357
01:33:51.611 --> 01:33:53.320
<v Speaker 1>acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steering everything.</v>

2358
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got,</v>

2359
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.903
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2360
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:57.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

2361
01:33:57.221 --> 01:33:58.900
<v Speaker 1>think about people should think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2362
01:33:58.901 --> 01:33:59.734
<v Speaker 1>They think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Onstar or think about the ability </v>

2363
01:34:01.451 --> 01:34:04.370
<v Speaker 1>for your car to send data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2364
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:07.000
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the vehicle manufacturer.</v>

2365
01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2366
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.840
<v Speaker 1>To tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2367
01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with your vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2368
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a handshake operation,</v>

2369
01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:14.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you do that,</v>

2370
01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.840
<v Speaker 1>that that means there's an exchange of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2371
01:34:16.841 --> 01:34:17.501
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2372
01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 1>that means you can access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you access that information?</v>

2373
01:34:19.991 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you can.</v>

2374
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean you can then take </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical controls short?</v>

2375
01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:24.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

2376
01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just another iteration of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange of information,</v>

2377
01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:28.893
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Software can take control of physical </v>

2378
01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.730
<v Speaker 1>systems so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2379
01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:34.803
<v Speaker 1>So the first part is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that that car could have </v>

2380
01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:39.230
<v Speaker 1>been taken over shore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2381
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:41.320
<v Speaker 1>do I think that's what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2382
01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2383
01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2384
01:34:44.651 --> 01:34:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a possibility.</v>

2385
01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I hear people talk about,</v>

2386
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain conspiracy theories,</v>

2387
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.823
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no fucking way that can </v>

2388
01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:53.290
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what one,</v>

2389
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:55.560
<v Speaker 1>one d say no fucking one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2390
01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 1>actually I have a hard</v>

2391
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:59.400
<v Speaker 3>time thinking of one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2392
01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it,</v>

2393
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 3>the theory that with every burner phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a boner.</v>

2394
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2395
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:08.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it sounds good.</v>

2396
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Misunderstood.</v>

2397
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.313
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is you get the burner </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone because you have a boner already </v>

2398
01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:17.610
<v Speaker 3>trying to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2399
01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2400
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.863
<v Speaker 3>I got the priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So until you secretary to get a burner </v>

2401
01:35:24.921 --> 01:35:29.921
<v Speaker 3>phone to meet her at the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>hotel,</v>

2402
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:31.700
<v Speaker 3>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>

2403
01:35:31.701 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Just like Jeff Bezos and he's $70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion down the down the toilet.</v>

2404
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2405
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.740
<v Speaker 3>how did they get his text messages?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good fucking cybersecurity.</v>

2406
01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:42.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got his text messages to his </v>

2407
01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:46.610
<v Speaker 3>mistress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

2409
01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:50.330
<v Speaker 3>unless maybe she maybe meaning Mrs </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bayzos,</v>

2410
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:52.050
<v Speaker 3>maybe she hired a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2411
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:52.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dodgy investigator to come up with </v>

2412
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.933
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2413
01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that it was an iphone.</v>

2414
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.903
<v Speaker 3>No visit an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had an I pad and she had the </v>

2415
01:36:01.701 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 3>password to the IPAD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She could get all those messages.</v>

2416
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:05.504
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2417
01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.800
<v Speaker 3>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2418
01:36:07.801 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 3>what do they live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live in Washington,</v>

2419
01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:09.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>State of Washington.</v>

2420
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2421
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:13.370
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess that's communal,</v>

2422
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2423
01:36:14.851 --> 01:36:15.740
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2424
01:36:15.741 --> 01:36:17.780
<v Speaker 3>they started the company together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She helped him.</v>

2425
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a wrap.</v>

2426
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2427
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 3>70 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2428
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 3>It's rough to give away 70 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's be completely honest.</v>

2429
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:29.143
<v Speaker 3>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have $70 billion and you notice </v>

2430
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:34.670
<v Speaker 3>whether you have 70 or a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2431
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All kind of,</v>

2432
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 3>you might be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the difference?</v>

2433
01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do you even feel it?</v>

2434
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.823
<v Speaker 3>If she takes 70 billion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is lifestyle change cause you have </v>

2435
01:36:44.061 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 3>to get rid of one of his jets.</v>

2436
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to give up cable.</v>

2437
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Does he have a bionic smaller ring for </v>
<v Speaker 3>his mistress?</v>

2438
01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:54.380
<v Speaker 3>But she's not even a is apparently they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were separated.</v>

2439
01:36:54.381 --> 01:36:56.260
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to get his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>

2440
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:57.103
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're saying he was cheating on his</v>

2442
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:00.554
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't really because they were </v>

2443
01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.830
<v Speaker 3>separated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:05.630
<v Speaker 3>You would think that that's fair game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure that it's anyway,</v>

2445
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be costly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so hot.</v>

2446
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's so cool.</v>

2447
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Bayzos or one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new one.</v>

2448
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.923
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2449
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:13.870
<v Speaker 3>I think they're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she and Mrs Bayzos.</v>

2450
01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.380
<v Speaker 3>We're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're friends.</v>

2451
01:37:15.381 --> 01:37:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all going to be very amicable.</v>

2452
01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.720
<v Speaker 3>They fucking circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what they're doing.</v>

2453
01:37:20.210 --> 01:37:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man doing,</v>

2454
01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.530
<v Speaker 3>they just take their time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their patient wolves.</v>

2455
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.180
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

2456
01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2457
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 3>he's changed if you look at Bayzos over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the years,</v>

2458
01:37:33.441 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2459
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:34.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look at the way he is now just </v>

2460
01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:38.240
<v Speaker 3>as physical appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just,</v>

2461
01:37:38.241 --> 01:37:40.430
<v Speaker 3>you can just tell that that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2462
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Money probably hired a personal trainer </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

2463
01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:44.260
<v Speaker 3>but he's got the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's gonna probably have to let them</v>

2464
01:37:44.261 --> 01:37:46.820
<v Speaker 3>go now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't afford that shit anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2466
01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:52.070
<v Speaker 3>the smart thing would honestly be to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to give away half.</v>

2467
01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Don't even duke it out with lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't take too long.</v>

2468

<v Speaker 3>What do you say?</v>

2504
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:20.063
<v Speaker 3>So sorry to hear the news about Jeff </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bozos being taken down by a competitor </v>

2505
01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.533
<v Speaker 3>who's reporting I understand is far more</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate than the reporting in his </v>

2506
01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:31.800
<v Speaker 3>lobbyist newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon Washington Post.</v>

2507
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully the paypal soon be placed in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

2508
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:36.420
<v Speaker 3>more responsible hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2509
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.940
<v Speaker 3>he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he watched it off.</v>

2510
01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.013
<v Speaker 3>He wants her to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants Bayzos to not have the </v>

2511
01:39:42.121 --> 01:39:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is highly critical.</v>

2512
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:45.303
<v Speaker 3>The president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while the inquirer has been known to </v>

2513
01:39:46.801 --> 01:39:47.940
<v Speaker 3>kill stores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>critical,</v>

2514
01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:48.930
<v Speaker 3>the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2515
01:39:48.931 --> 01:39:51.780
<v Speaker 3>so the enquirer got ahold of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

2516
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:56.640
<v Speaker 3>but you know it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet Jeff Bezos in president's mind.</v>

2517
01:39:56.910 --> 01:40:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet is his opinion went up when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw that picture of Sanchez probably.</v>

2518
01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:02.243
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you probably read the text </v>

2519
01:40:03.631 --> 01:40:04.540
<v Speaker 3>messages and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2520
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:06.280
<v Speaker 3>amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

2521
01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you telling her that uh,</v>

2522
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:09.210
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>

2523
01:40:09.211 --> 01:40:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Jump right out of the frying pan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get right back into the fire.</v>

2524
01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.653
<v Speaker 3>How about you go to fucking Ibiza and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dance on the couch with a hundred of </v>

2525
01:40:16.321 --> 01:40:17.154
<v Speaker 3>those broads?</v>

2526
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Take a little time off is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2527
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Jeff needs a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs a coach.</v>

2528
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:22.493
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that interesting how dude's do I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think by wealthy dude seem to do that </v>

2529
01:40:25.231 --> 01:40:26.064
<v Speaker 3>more than others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seem to go straight from one </v>

2530
01:40:27.511 --> 01:40:29.580
<v Speaker 3>relationship immediately into another </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2531
01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Whereas I think that the average dude I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is doing what you're thinking,</v>

2532
01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:34.081
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2533
01:40:34.081 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna take some time down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the average dude also isn't running</v>

2534
01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:40.500
<v Speaker 3>a gigantic multinational corporation </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Amazon.</v>

2535
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:41.543
<v Speaker 3>The thing about that is the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that that guy has to dedicate to </v>

2536
01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:48.720
<v Speaker 3>his job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be just unfathomable.</v>

2537
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine what,</v>

2538
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.013
<v Speaker 3>what is involved and that guy's day to </v>
<v Speaker 3>day activity and he seems ruthless as </v>

2539
01:40:55.151 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 3>fuck and very hands on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how did,</v>

2540
01:40:58.530 --> 01:40:59.363
<v Speaker 3>he probably doesn't have time to go to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>visa if the average guy had anywhere </v>

2541
01:41:02.621 --> 01:41:04.570
<v Speaker 3>close to a hundred billion dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2542

<v Speaker 1>we can be up in the foothills in </v>

2672
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:30.050
<v Speaker 1>literally about seven minutes and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend the afternoon and not see anybody.</v>

2673
01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:31.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2674
01:45:31.341 --> 01:45:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And we live right in the center of town </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

2675
01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2676
01:45:34.551 --> 01:45:35.960
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2677
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Talk Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell him about,</v>

2678
01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a note from a,</v>

2679
01:45:40.890 --> 01:45:43.610
<v Speaker 1>and go from mugsy my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my youngest boys teacher,</v>

2680
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:46.410
<v Speaker 1>he's like seven years old and he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like seven years old.</v>

2681
01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.030
<v Speaker 1>He has seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2682
01:45:48.031 --> 01:45:48.864
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's approximately somewhere in the </v>

2683
01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:50.920
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2684
01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:51.803
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to hide his actual age for </v>

2685
01:45:52.881 --> 01:45:54.640
<v Speaker 1>security reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

2686
01:45:54.641 --> 01:45:55.474
<v Speaker 1>we got a note from his teacher sang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened a little bit of trouble </v>

2687
01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 1>finishing his assignments on time and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of wanted to check in with you</v>

2688
01:46:02.691 --> 01:46:03.770
<v Speaker 1>to see how to motivate them.</v>

2689
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.053
<v Speaker 1>And this was just yesterday and I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>this message as did my absolutely </v>

2690
01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:11.210
<v Speaker 1>fantastic wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2691
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 1>so we had a funny conversation about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2692
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.140
<v Speaker 1>how do we respond to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

2693
01:46:15.141 --> 01:46:20.141
<v Speaker 1>he's seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of it working for a living.</v>

2694
01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:23.720
<v Speaker 1>How do you motivate them to cut and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paste faster or something?</v>

2695
01:46:23.721 --> 01:46:24.790
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

2696
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:26.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I could think of was food,</v>

2697
01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my retriever,</v>

2698
01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:28.870
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:31.520
<v Speaker 1>he's food motivated my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm figuring,</v>

2700
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monk,</v>

2701
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:33.470
<v Speaker 1>he's the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2702
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you give them a cupcake and he'll finish</v>
<v Speaker 1>that assignment.</v>

2703
01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 1>So I had no idea I was really stymied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2704
01:46:41.031 --> 01:46:43.130
<v Speaker 1>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we all,</v>

2705
01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean our kids are,</v>

2706
01:46:44.511 --> 01:46:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else,</v>

2707
01:46:45.531 --> 01:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you always feel your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey great kids are smart and everything,</v>

2708
01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2709
01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 1>so I give</v>

2710
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.780
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give the teacher a lot of credit,</v>

2711
01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for being focused like that.</v>

2712
01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.270
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time I stepped back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked at,</v>

2713
01:46:55.271 --> 01:46:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I go and it's okay if he wants to slack </v>
<v Speaker 3>off a little bit,</v>

2714
01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:58.733
<v Speaker 3>he's 77 exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we have this obsession with </v>

2715
01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:03.720
<v Speaker 3>getting kids to the bus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like I was a,</v>

2716
01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:04.554
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's going to put their</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid in a Waldorf school and we were </v>

2717
01:47:07.741 --> 01:47:08.574
<v Speaker 3>talking about that and I guess they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even teach him to read until the </v>

2718
01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:14.620
<v Speaker 3>third grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my wife was like,</v>

2719
01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.473
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck Outta here with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because my youngest daughter's in the </v>

2720
01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 3>third grade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she reads great.</v>

2721
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:23.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean we read every night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she reads perfectly.</v>

2722
01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:24.253
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if she hadn't even started </v>

2723
01:47:25.711 --> 01:47:27.420
<v Speaker 3>learning how to read yet that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2724
01:47:27.421 --> 01:47:30.120
<v Speaker 3>that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what opens up everything else.</v>

2725
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:31.830
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't delay it.</v>

2726
01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:33.460
<v Speaker 3>That part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2727
01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:35.300
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2728
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I know we finish every evening with </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2729
01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:38.250
<v Speaker 3>the kids have to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2730
01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Get on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2731
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:41.370
<v Speaker 3>finished reading too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>

2732
01:47:41.371 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think it's a bad thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have kids read,</v>

2733
01:47:44.731 --> 01:47:48.080
<v Speaker 3>but what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does you heard it here?</v>

2734
01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:51.930
<v Speaker 3>First verse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll taking a country writer.</v>

2735
01:47:51.931 --> 01:47:54.270
<v Speaker 3>She'll stand on reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support it.</v>

2736
01:47:55.090 --> 01:47:58.190
<v Speaker 3>What does concern me though is homework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>do two hours of women.</v>

2740
01:48:07.670 --> 01:48:08.503
<v Speaker 3>There's probably got activities to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports activities and so that consumes </v>

2741
01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:15.750
<v Speaker 3>gymnastics bunch of other shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's these kids,</v>

2742
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:20.550
<v Speaker 3>they want these kids to grow up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become hugely successful.</v>

2743
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:22.200

<v Speaker 3>that you did up in Boise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was was fantastic.</v>

2766
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 3>How long did that run?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

2767
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I was laughing my ass off so I didn't,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and 15 minutes and that took me,</v>

2769
01:49:28.650 --> 01:49:29.483
<v Speaker 3>that was what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I went up to boise was a couple </v>

01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it takes me two years to put together</v>

2774
01:49:45.031 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 3>where it's I fucking hammer that Samurai</v>

2785
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in the beginning of Standup,</v>

2786
01:50:14.370 --> 01:50:18.610
<v Speaker 3>you treat your jokes like their tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like uh oh this is a phillips head.</v>

2787
01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I need a phillips head screwdriver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fit that in there.</v>

2788
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.950
<v Speaker 3>And then after a while you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2789
01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:24.813
<v Speaker 3>let me do what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk about shit that I </v>

2790
01:50:26.951 --> 01:50:27.910
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have,</v>

2791
01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:28.773
<v Speaker 3>and then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the art form is trying to figure </v>

2792
01:50:30.101 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 3>out how to make ideas funny.</v>

2793
01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:36.910
<v Speaker 3>And then then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if these ideas are funny to me,</v>

2794
01:50:36.911 --> 01:50:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I've got to figure out a way to get them</v>
<v Speaker 3>funded for other people.</v>

2795
01:50:38.831 --> 01:50:40.750
<v Speaker 3>But if they're not funny to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested.</v>

2796
01:50:41.370 --> 01:50:42.203
<v Speaker 3>And then so what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put something together and then you </v>

2797
01:50:44.531 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 3>test it out on the kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and homer,</v>

2798
01:50:46.391 --> 01:50:47.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to tell you.</v>

2799
01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:48.023
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2800
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:49.930
<v Speaker 3>You take it to like a small place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2801
01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.533
<v Speaker 3>I take it to clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the Ice House and the comedy </v>

2802
01:50:54.101 --> 01:50:54.934
<v Speaker 3>store and the Improv and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to these local places in La and I </v>

2803
01:50:58.481 --> 01:50:59.314
<v Speaker 3>might do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like last night I did three shows and </v>

2804
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:01.931
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2805
01:51:01.931 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do that.</v>

2806
01:51:04.721 --> 01:51:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I'll do four shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do one show at the Improv,</v>

2807
01:51:06.761 --> 01:51:08.280
<v Speaker 3>three at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that all the time.</v>

2808
01:51:08.290 --> 01:51:09.580
<v Speaker 3>How long did the shows h I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each,</v>

2809
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:10.650
<v Speaker 3>each sets our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2810
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes less.</v>

2811
01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes must be exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2812
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:17.020
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about how it's a fake job,</v>

2813
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:17.854
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2814
01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:20.430
<v Speaker 3>you gotta get up in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the reaction's going</v>

2815
01:51:20.431 --> 01:51:23.260
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best job that I do,</v>

2816
01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:24.094
<v Speaker 3>but also the most work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the best out of the fake jobs </v>

2817
01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:27.874
<v Speaker 3>that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best fake job because it's </v>

2818
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:30.544
<v Speaker 3>the most fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2819
01:51:30.730 --> 01:51:33.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Boise thing was like 11,000 people.</v>

2820
01:51:33.131 --> 01:51:36.970
<v Speaker 3>If you crush in front of 11,000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feeling is just,</v>

2821
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 3>when you hear the roar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you hit a punchline,</v>

2822
01:51:39.521 --> 01:51:43.000
<v Speaker 3>you hear the roar of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's nothing like that.</v>

2823
01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Nothing like that in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2824
01:51:45.701 --> 01:51:46.480
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2825
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.240
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody get a chance to go see,</v>

2826
01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:49.093
<v Speaker 3>go see a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause this one's just go see my netflix </v>

2827
01:51:51.551 --> 01:51:55.330
<v Speaker 3>specials so you can see that thing now </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to pay more for Netflix now.</v>

2828
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like 10 bucks?</v>

2829
01:51:56.890 --> 01:51:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17% more.</v>

2830
01:51:57.971 --> 01:51:59.060
<v Speaker 3>I think they're going to charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2831
01:51:59.080 --> 01:51:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>

2832
01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:00.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2833
01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I have so much good shit though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to just waste your life</v>

2834
01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:08.170
<v Speaker 3>and sit in front of the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2835
01:52:08.171 --> 01:52:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Like when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's your passion.</v>

2836
01:52:10.630 --> 01:52:11.463
<v Speaker 3>So you get that universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my following my passion means I got </v>

2837
01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:17.680
<v Speaker 3>to sit and watch every episode of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy Fart under the sheets.</v>

2838
01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:20.140
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of people doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2839
01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's bad is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2840
01:52:22.781 --> 01:52:23.614
<v Speaker 3>yes it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then doesn't that open the door for </v>

2841
01:52:25.691 --> 01:52:26.524
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that aren't going to be like </v>

2842
01:52:27.581 --> 01:52:28.630
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look,</v>

2843
01:52:28.631 --> 01:52:31.420
<v Speaker 3>less people out there really actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get ahead.</v>

2844
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.823
<v Speaker 3>I think the people that are going to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to succeed are always going to try to </v>

2845
01:52:34.751 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 3>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true and I think so.</v>

2846
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:37.204
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's an argument against it </v>

2847
01:52:38.411 --> 01:52:39.510
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is said like,</v>

2848
01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to unlock a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole treasure trove of innovators.</v>

2849
01:52:44.471 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If suddenly</v>

2850
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>you give people money and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2851
01:52:48.651 --> 01:52:50.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2852
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 1>poor coffee or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or flip burgers or you know,</v>

2853
01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:54.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean up that road or whatever you're </v>

2854
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 1>going to do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can follow your passion.</v>

2855
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:58.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're going to find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential increase in the number of </v>

2856
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:01.934
<v Speaker 1>people inventing the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it's just going to be </v>

2857
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:06.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot more people farden under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blankets or something.</v>

2858
01:53:06.711 --> 01:53:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be right,</v>

2859
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:09.043
<v Speaker 1>but the only good that I think could </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of it as a less people were in </v>

2860
01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:15.230
<v Speaker 1>abject poverty and less people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate.</v>

2861
01:53:15.231 --> 01:53:19.220
<v Speaker 1>So it might reduce crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have lazy people,</v>

2862
01:53:19.221 --> 01:53:20.054
<v Speaker 1>but you might also have less people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are inclined to steal things or do </v>

2863
01:53:23.871 --> 01:53:27.050
<v Speaker 1>something that's illegal because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic needs are taken care of.</v>

2864
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:29.450
<v Speaker 1>That's valid point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read something that's,</v>

2865
01:53:29.451 --> 01:53:30.170
<v Speaker 1>it stunned me.</v>

2866
01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on a plane flying to,</v>

2867
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to La.</v>

2868
01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:33.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I read an article about this does </v>

2869
01:53:36.161 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 1>strike right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teachers here in Los Angeles,</v>

2870
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:40.873
<v Speaker 1>big strike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles unified a school authority </v>

2871
01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:48.040
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just before they,</v>

2872
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.883
<v Speaker 1>they went on strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it talked about the problems at the </v>

2873
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:52.664
<v Speaker 1>school district has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know whether this statistic </v>

2874
01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:55.694
<v Speaker 1>is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it numerous times because I was </v>

2875
01:53:56.781 --> 01:53:59.870
<v Speaker 1>so surprised by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of the,</v>

2876
01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:04.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>families that use the Los Angeles public</v>

2877
01:54:04.311 --> 01:54:08.840
<v Speaker 1>school system are at the poverty level </v>
<v Speaker 1>or below.</v>

2878
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.393
<v Speaker 1>And that means of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also that they rely on the free meal </v>

2879
01:54:13.971 --> 01:54:14.850
<v Speaker 1>assistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2880
01:54:14.851 --> 01:54:15.684
<v Speaker 1>That the schools provide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what was the point of </v>

2881
01:54:17.211 --> 01:54:19.430
<v Speaker 1>the story was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the schools are closed right now.</v>

2882
01:54:19.431 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2883
01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:21.550
<v Speaker 1>kids aren't getting a chance to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

2884
01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.970
<v Speaker 1>that's their only chance to get to eat.</v>

2885
01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that number was stunning.</v>

2886
01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:26.610
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2887
01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>

2888
01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:28.573
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant to look into it and do more </v>

2889
01:54:29.541 --> 01:54:31.580
<v Speaker 1>research to see whether the article is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually correct or not,</v>

2890
01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the newspaper,</v>

2891
01:54:32.971 --> 01:54:34.220
<v Speaker 1>so it must be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2892
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

2893
01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2894
01:54:38.210 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 1>he's a disturbing number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very disturbing number.</v>

2895
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:41.384
<v Speaker 1>But it also talked about how 12%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 12% of all kids that go to high </v>

2896
01:54:46.491 --> 01:54:50.150
<v Speaker 1>school here in Los Angeles then go on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

2897
01:54:50.210 --> 01:54:52.460
<v Speaker 1>12%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2898
01:54:52.461 --> 01:54:53.294
<v Speaker 1>it was a similar number that never get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of high school and it's even worse </v>

2899
01:54:56.361 --> 01:54:58.100
<v Speaker 1>than a place like New York City public </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

2900
01:54:58.190 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the point being is a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>school system is,</v>

2901
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:03.770
<v Speaker 1>is it's dog shit in the larger urban </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers.</v>

2902
01:55:03.771 --> 01:55:04.604
<v Speaker 1>It's got some real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of those people that </v>

2903
01:55:05.961 --> 01:55:06.794
<v Speaker 1>are the really sad things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people that are at the </v>

2904
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:13.280
<v Speaker 1>poverty line or below work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a lack of motivation and said,</v>

2905
01:55:13.281 --> 01:55:14.510
<v Speaker 1>just don't have opportunities.</v>

2906
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:17.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That not doing it the right way.</v>

2907
01:55:17.301 --> 01:55:18.134
<v Speaker 1>They don't have guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never learned correctly when they </v>

2908
01:55:20.211 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 1>were young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single parent.</v>

2909
01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:23.210
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the two or three jobs?</v>

2910
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>

2911
01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:27.440
<v Speaker 1>but I love California has got all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of interesting issues.</v>

2912
01:55:27.441 --> 01:55:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2913
01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2914
01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.760
<v Speaker 1>talking to some folks and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2915
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:35.810
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of the nation's homeless </v>
<v Speaker 1>people live here in California.</v>

2916
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:41.270
<v Speaker 1>25% of the nation's homeless people live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California and a place to live.</v>

2917
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2918
01:55:41.770 --> 01:55:42.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2919
01:55:42.131 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's raised in the last few days.</v>

2920
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Most of the times it's beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>weather.</v>

2921
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't complain about the weather anyway,</v>

2922
01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but it is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2923
01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and it also talks about how a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people,</v>

2924
01:55:52.170 --> 01:55:54.330
<v Speaker 1>they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're homeless,</v>

2925
01:55:54.331 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cost of housing.</v>

2926
01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got people that have a job</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're living in their cars,</v>

2927
01:55:59.040 --> 01:55:59.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2928
01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:00.053
<v Speaker 1>Because they can't afford housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in San Francisco or Los </v>

2929
01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insanity.</v>

2930
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:06.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2931
01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:07.073
<v Speaker 1>that place is insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your point about the basic universal </v>

2932
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take that point.</v>

2933
01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I see what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2934
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 1>if it was possible to pay for it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2935
01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of do this thing where you,</v>

2936
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:21.203
<v Speaker 1>you're monitoring this issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation so you're not creating </v>

2937
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 1>another follow on generation of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete slack acids.</v>

2938
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Then I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really valid point.</v>

2939
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.633
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my concern would be people that didn't </v>

2940
01:56:31.501 --> 01:56:33.900
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it and people that felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled,</v>

2941
01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.720
<v Speaker 1>like they felt like someone owed them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>

2942
01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the,</v>

2943
01:56:39.211 --> 01:56:40.044
<v Speaker 1>this is the biggest problem that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have with socialism and socialist </v>

2944
01:56:41.941 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 1>attitudes that some of these kids that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are coming up right now,</v>

2945
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:47.280
<v Speaker 1>they look at what they call income </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>

2946
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 1>what they don't look at his effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>

2947
01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Like some people put in more fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and are smarter.</v>

2948
01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:56.544
<v Speaker 1>They've figured their way through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game better than you have been doing it </v>

2949
01:56:59.881 --> 01:57:01.900
<v Speaker 1>for 50 years or whatever they brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2950
01:57:02.490 --> 01:57:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree with him more in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that I,</v>

2951
01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:06.413
<v Speaker 1>I never begrudged anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got pissed off with a rich </v>

2952
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:11.880
<v Speaker 1>person because they were rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2953
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2954
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:14.400
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be rich.</v>

2955
01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2956
01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.980
<v Speaker 1>So I might want to talk and find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2957
01:57:17.070 --> 01:57:18.420
<v Speaker 1>how'd you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or how'd you do it?</v>

2958
01:57:18.421 --> 01:57:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a system sometimes,</v>

2959
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up so that once you have some money,</v>

2960
01:57:22.471 --> 01:57:23.610
<v Speaker 1>you can get more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2961
01:57:23.611 --> 01:57:25.080
<v Speaker 1>of course the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2962
01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2963
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.393
<v Speaker 1>if I have some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can invest that money and make more </v>

2964
01:57:27.811 --> 01:57:30.030
<v Speaker 1>money if I'm smart about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do it right.</v>

2965
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it right.</v>

2966
01:57:30.751 --> 01:57:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But I absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2967
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:33.143
<v Speaker 1>and I don't begrudge the idea that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of it is also fairly </v>

2968
01:57:36.901 --> 01:57:38.270
<v Speaker 1>steeped in the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2969
01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2970
01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.700
<v Speaker 1>unique country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2971
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:45.540
<v Speaker 1>And I do worry sometimes that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2972
01:57:46.610 --> 01:57:47.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2973
01:57:47.501 --> 01:57:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2974
01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:48.953
<v Speaker 1>even family and I've got some friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and others who were just constantly </v>

2975
01:57:51.181 --> 01:57:53.790
<v Speaker 1>pissing and moaning about this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking,</v>

2976
01:57:53.791 --> 01:57:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I spent almost all my life over and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes around the world and I,</v>

2977
01:57:58.590 --> 01:58:00.990
<v Speaker 1>there is no other place I would rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>be as a country.</v>

2978
01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:01.681
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2979
01:58:01.681 --> 01:58:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it's jingoistic or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2980
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.760
<v Speaker 1>honest to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still believe,</v>

2981
01:58:05.761 --> 01:58:08.940
<v Speaker 1>and if you go someplace and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to somebody in some fifth world,</v>

2982
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:12.180
<v Speaker 1>they will also have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience has been any way,</v>

2983
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:14.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're listening in,</v>

2984
01:58:14.341 --> 01:58:15.174
<v Speaker 1>your experience is different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the way it works is that </v>

2985
01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:21.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll think if I go to America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can get to America and I work hard,</v>

2986
01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be successful.</v>

2987
01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:24.893
<v Speaker 1>And that I think is still true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I worry about with </v>

2988
01:58:27.361 --> 01:58:30.870
<v Speaker 1>entitlements and thinks that that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill that belief.</v>

2989
01:58:30.871 --> 01:58:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incoming inequality.</v>

2990
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2991
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:35.250
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's your right,</v>

2992
01:58:35.251 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you work harder now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always happen,</v>

2993
01:58:37.411 --> 01:58:38.630
<v Speaker 1>but life's not supposed to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2994
01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe it's supposed to be fair,</v>

2995
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2996
01:58:41.890 --> 01:58:43.620
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just supposed to be life.</v>

2997
01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.280
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2998
01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2999
01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:47.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3000
01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:50.350
<v Speaker 2>I completely see your point and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with it.</v>

3001
01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:51.483
<v Speaker 2>I think that the real concern is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't appreciate already how </v>

3002
01:58:55.001 --> 01:58:57.850
<v Speaker 2>great they have and what incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity they have.</v>

3003
01:58:58.210 --> 01:58:59.043
<v Speaker 2>And if we increase w w we give them more</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits with less effort than you're </v>

3004
01:59:03.551 --> 01:59:06.220
<v Speaker 2>going to develop more of this attitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we find disturbing,</v>

3005
01:59:06.221 --> 01:59:07.054
<v Speaker 2>which is people that don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for literally the greatest </v>

3006
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 2>experiment in self government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world has ever known.</v>

3007
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3008
01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:14.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3009
01:59:14.130 --> 01:59:14.963
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3010
01:59:15.210 --> 01:59:16.043
<v Speaker 1>but I think also that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of it that need to be </v>

3011
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:19.451
<v Speaker 1>looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>

3012
01:59:19.451 --> 01:59:20.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting study about,</v>

3013
01:59:20.801 --> 01:59:21.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3014
01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:26.950
<v Speaker 1>about college and graduation rates from </v>
<v Speaker 1>college for,</v>

3015
01:59:27.370 --> 01:59:28.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3016
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:30.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantaged folks.</v>

3017
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was again,</v>

3018
01:59:31.871 --> 01:59:34.960
<v Speaker 1>why they made it easier for tuition </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistance.</v>

3019
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:35.794
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was we want to expand the </v>

3020
01:59:38.351 --> 01:59:41.290
<v Speaker 1>college ability for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great idea.</v>

3021
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they found was they expanded </v>

3022
01:59:43.571 --> 01:59:43.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3023
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3024
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:48.640
<v Speaker 1>the college opportunity for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But over the past decade,</v>

3025
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:52.180
<v Speaker 1>decade and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer people from the lower income,</v>

3026
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3027
01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.350
<v Speaker 1>categories have been graduating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3028
01:59:56.410 --> 01:59:58.090
<v Speaker 1>So you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've done is you said,</v>

3029
01:59:58.091 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3030
01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a special operators,</v>

3031
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:02.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

3032
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.700
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lower the bar,</v>

3033
02:00:03.810 --> 02:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3034
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:05.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I'm going to get in </v>

3035
02:00:06.851 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 1>trouble probably.</v>

3036
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about the marines and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3037
02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>allowing women into combat elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3038
02:00:11.681 --> 02:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what did they do?</v>

3039
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lower the bar.</v>

3040
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3041
02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:16.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not enough of them could get </v>

3042
02:00:17.711 --> 02:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>through the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to change the regulations.</v>

3043
02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And so if you change the regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they found,</v>

3044
02:00:23.771 --> 02:00:25.150
<v Speaker 1>where the college was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3045
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>if you increase that pool of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

3046
02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

3047
02:00:29.710 --> 02:00:30.543
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now what you've done is you've kind </v>

3048
02:00:31.391 --> 02:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>of saddle them with some college debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't graduate.</v>

3049
02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:35.853
<v Speaker 1>So they're still earning what a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school graduate earns and the system </v>

3050
02:00:39.371 --> 02:00:40.204
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think sometimes just the idea </v>

3051
02:00:42.221 --> 02:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>of throwing money at the problem or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

3052
02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:44.573
<v Speaker 1>or it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful if we don't think it </v>

3053
02:00:47.681 --> 02:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>through and then assess the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3054
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.861
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3055
02:00:50.861 --> 02:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole marine experiment,</v>

3056
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3057
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.033
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're catching it laid in the chain </v>

3058
02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:56.593
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's good to give people the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to succeed and to advance </v>

3059
02:01:00.561 --> 02:01:01.394
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you really want to address it as </v>

3060
02:01:03.111 --> 02:01:05.930
<v Speaker 2>a systemic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get to the root of it,</v>

3061
02:01:05.931 --> 02:01:09.980
<v Speaker 2>which is these unbelievably horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and these,</v>

3062
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:10.843
<v Speaker 2>these toxic environments that these kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>are growing up and being abused and </v>

3063
02:01:14.210 --> 02:01:18.380
<v Speaker 2>being scared and bullied and terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>piss poor education,</v>

3064
02:01:18.650 --> 02:01:19.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first through all the way up to high </v>

3065
02:01:22.071 --> 02:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3066
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:24.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really where you have to address </v>

3067
02:01:25.131 --> 02:01:25.520
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3068
02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:26.353
<v Speaker 2>addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust at the college level and giving </v>

3069
02:01:27.891 --> 02:01:30.650
<v Speaker 2>them the opportunity to get into college</v>
<v Speaker 2>and making it easier for them.</v>

3070
02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:31.933
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't negate the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation that's been laid by their </v>

3071
02:01:35.571 --> 02:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3072
02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:36.953
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we had this idea that </v>

3073
02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>college should be for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3074
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

3075
02:01:42.121 --> 02:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where the,</v>

3076
02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Cortez and Bernie Sanders </v>

3077
02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and others with their idea of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuition,</v>

3078
02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>

3079
02:01:49.551 --> 02:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look at Europe.</v>

3080
02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:52.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some countries in Europe have </v>

3081
02:01:52.911 --> 02:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>free tuition and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3082
02:01:54.231 --> 02:01:55.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's relatively prosperous and there's </v>

3083
02:01:55.761 --> 02:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

3084
02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

3085
02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3086
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>we don't assess the cost and the overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency of an idea sometimes.</v>

3087
02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.293
<v Speaker 1>And so we just assume and open it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let everybody go and somehow this is </v>

3088
02:02:13.011 --> 02:02:13.844
<v Speaker 1>going to work right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To our advantage and honest got answer </v>

3089
02:02:16.671 --> 02:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3090
02:02:18.501 --> 02:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I think somebody is better off </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

3091
02:02:20.451 --> 02:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into,</v>

3092
02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a plumber,</v>

3093
02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

3094
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe not honorable living.</v>

3095
02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a living great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:28.083
<v Speaker 1>To create living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the happiest guys I know is my </v>

3097
02:02:30.681 --> 02:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>plumber in Boise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy is,</v>

3098
02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got it knocked right.</v>

3099
02:02:34.371 --> 02:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>He's always out for hunting season and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3100
02:02:37.131 --> 02:02:37.761
<v Speaker 1>he'll call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>

3101
02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:38.380
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta,</v>

3102
02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I gotta Lick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3103
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a if my ceilings about the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

3104
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going hunting and sorry,</v>

3105
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>he's just got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his own schedule.</v>

3106
02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:47.773
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's got a great job and there's </v>

3107
02:02:49.821 --> 02:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we developed this idea.</v>

3108
02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:53.384
<v Speaker 1>So like homeownership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody should own a home when we saw </v>

3109
02:02:55.161 --> 02:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>with that took us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3110
02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:57.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you lower the requirements and </v>

3111
02:02:58.341 --> 02:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>suddenly we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3112
02:02:59.291 --> 02:03:01.910
<v Speaker 1>it's blown up and we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

3113
02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:02.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I know?</v>

3114
02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:03.733
<v Speaker 1>What do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

3115
02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:07.560
<v Speaker 2>what do I know either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see your points and I know,</v>

3116
02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.473
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that one thing to disturb the </v>

3117
02:03:10.591 --> 02:03:12.660
<v Speaker 2>shit out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his student loans,</v>

3118
02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:13.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean you w one of the worst ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare a kid for the futures to saddle </v>

3119
02:03:16.981 --> 02:03:17.814
<v Speaker 2>them down with a quarter million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth of debt by the time they graduate </v>

3120
02:03:19.771 --> 02:03:21.420
<v Speaker 2>from college right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3121
02:03:21.450 --> 02:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>And then they get a $50,000 a year job </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

3122
02:03:24.061 --> 02:03:24.894
<v Speaker 2>what in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing well with a $50,000 a </v>

3123
02:03:27.361 --> 02:03:29.850
<v Speaker 2>year job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great job to get out of college</v>

3124
02:03:29.851 --> 02:03:33.180
<v Speaker 2>and in you just look at the debt that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have and you're like,</v>

3125
02:03:33.181 --> 02:03:35.910
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to pay this shit?</v>

3126
02:03:35.970 --> 02:03:36.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3127
02:03:36.331 --> 02:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have sold a student's a bill.</v>

3128
02:03:38.561 --> 02:03:39.710
<v Speaker 1>A good yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3129
02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3130
02:03:41.490 --> 02:03:42.061
<v Speaker 1>some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3131
02:03:42.061 --> 02:03:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3132
02:03:43.141 --> 02:03:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3133
02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:44.593
<v Speaker 1>the older students are the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to take out this loan and then </v>

3134
02:03:46.861 --> 02:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>suddenly they're using the money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

3135
02:03:48.301 --> 02:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

3136
02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>There's individual responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

3137
02:03:51.481 --> 02:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you that there's student </v>
<v Speaker 1>loan debt is a,</v>

3138
02:03:53.291 --> 02:03:54.124
<v Speaker 1>is a major issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We occasionally that the Capitol Hill </v>

3139
02:03:56.131 --> 02:03:58.020
<v Speaker 1>talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>

3140
02:03:58.021 --> 02:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my daughter,</v>

3141
02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:01.260
<v Speaker 1>who's a fantastic person and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3142
02:04:01.261 --> 02:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>the biggest gift you're getting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting out of college without any,</v>

3143
02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.720
<v Speaker 1>any debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3144
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

3145
02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.320
<v Speaker 1>dad's not going to buy you your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>wagon here.</v>

3146
02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:15.140
<v Speaker 2>You got to pick out your tuition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

3147
02:04:15.170 --> 02:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best I can.</v>

3148
02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:19.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a gigantic headstart for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3149
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:21.850
<v Speaker 2>it sounds so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

3150
02:04:21.851 --> 02:04:24.720
<v Speaker 2>To not be in debt is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3151
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:25.743
<v Speaker 2>they're giving kids credit cards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their frontal lobes aren't even </v>

3152
02:04:27.641 --> 02:04:29.590
<v Speaker 2>developed yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing all kinds of wacky.</v>

3153
02:04:29.591 --> 02:04:30.221
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3154
02:04:30.221 --> 02:04:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you ain't figuring out shit.</v>

3155
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:33.303
<v Speaker 2>He never figured out things up till now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that you're going to get </v>

3156
02:04:35.741 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>magically smarter over the next months </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you owe</v>

3157
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.540
<v Speaker 3>all this money is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3158

<v Speaker 3>You kids oldest have a phone yet for </v>
<v Speaker 3>security purposes or what is this?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't even figure out what that is.</v>

3162
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:55.740
<v Speaker 3>One point 6 trillion try got really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at go.</v>

3163
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:56.903
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what is this website that people can </v>

3164
02:04:58.921 --> 02:04:59.754
<v Speaker 3>go to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This college debt.com I just typed in </v>

3165
02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.450
<v Speaker 3>student loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3166
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:05.683
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is an insane amount of money on a </v>

3167
02:05:08.221 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

3168
02:05:09.271 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is like I'm just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>guessing off what I'm seeing.</v>

3169
02:05:11.941 --> 02:05:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an insane amount of money.</v>

3170
02:05:13.891 --> 02:05:16.440
<v Speaker 3>So you just made that number up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just just stop at whatever.</v>

3171
02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:19.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't look at credit cards.</v>

3172
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:20.873
<v Speaker 3>Auto loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the credit cards and auto loans </v>

3173
02:05:22.471 --> 02:05:24.780
<v Speaker 3>for us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us Americans are students.</v>

3174
02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:26.880
<v Speaker 3>And then those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all credit card debt.</v>

3175
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:29.890
<v Speaker 3>When I just looked at two on another </v>
<v Speaker 3>page that had a clock at that,</v>

3176
02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:30.793
<v Speaker 3>it's just the same number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said it's not including the interest </v>

3177
02:05:32.611 --> 02:05:37.611
<v Speaker 3>on the federal loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3178
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>So you look at that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3179
02:05:39.921 --> 02:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>no wonder it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a popular idea of saying you've got</v>

3180
02:05:42.481 --> 02:05:43.314
<v Speaker 1>to write down student loans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get free tuition going on </v>

3181
02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 1>and do all these things again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3182
02:05:48.110 --> 02:05:49.260
<v Speaker 1>can the country pay for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3183
02:05:49.261 --> 02:05:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we be talking about it?</v>

3184
02:05:51.261 --> 02:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll be looking for other alternatives</v>

3185
02:05:53.361 --> 02:05:54.200
<v Speaker 1>and other options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3186
02:05:54.201 --> 02:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

3187
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:56.623
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3188
02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:58.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not even willing to address the </v>

3189
02:05:59.211 --> 02:06:00.044
<v Speaker 1>issue of social security and Medicare </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to deal with entitlement to </v>

3190
02:06:03.661 --> 02:06:05.250
<v Speaker 1>say currently exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we know,</v>

3191
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to bankrupt us at some point.</v>

3192
02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's not,</v>

3193
02:06:10.101 --> 02:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not a mystery and we can't deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

3194
02:06:12.681 --> 02:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>So how are we going to deal with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other issues?</v>

3195
02:06:15.110 --> 02:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question I had about a guy</v>

3196
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:20.280
<v Speaker 3>trump who doesn't seem to like to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to things.</v>

3197
02:06:20.610 --> 02:06:21.443
<v Speaker 3>How the hell is one person supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in the director of all these various </v>

3198
02:06:27.271 --> 02:06:28.500
<v Speaker 3>aspects of our world?</v>

3199
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:29.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3200
02:06:29.791 --> 02:06:30.101
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3201
02:06:30.101 --> 02:06:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3202
02:06:31.051 --> 02:06:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3203
02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.870
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3204
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of the economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3205
02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:36.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3206
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:38.100
<v Speaker 1>can't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it went very,</v>

3207
02:06:38.130 --> 02:06:38.963
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart economist who was talking </v>

3208
02:06:40.861 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 1>about this and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we expect of a president.</v>

3209
02:06:43.801 --> 02:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Think about all these things the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president has to be cognizant of and,</v>

3210
02:06:46.871 --> 02:06:47.704
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and supposedly capable of digesting a </v>

3211
02:06:49.621 --> 02:06:52.680
<v Speaker 1>lot of information and making decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a very number of things.</v>

3212
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:53.551
<v Speaker 1>And obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3213
02:06:53.551 --> 02:06:54.384
<v Speaker 1>you delegate and you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is an interesting system and it </v>

3214
02:06:59.191 --> 02:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>is interesting how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3215
02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:01.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean right now there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have faith in the current </v>

3216
02:07:03.211 --> 02:07:04.290
<v Speaker 1>president to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3217
02:07:04.291 --> 02:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>some of your basic decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3218
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:07.253
<v Speaker 1>previous administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people that was </v>

3219
02:07:08.191 --> 02:07:11.340
<v Speaker 1>convinced he could understand anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3220
02:07:11.341 --> 02:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was capable of all of it.</v>

3221
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:17.100
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think the job itself is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

3222
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And I just think that the way that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3223
02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:25.710
<v Speaker 1>go through the selection process has </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly over a period of time,</v>

3224
02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone downhill and is kind of resulted in</v>

3225
02:07:28.801 --> 02:07:30.220
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it's the,</v>

3226
02:07:30.230 --> 02:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit primary process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3227
02:07:32.641 --> 02:07:34.890
<v Speaker 1>and the way that we do the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection,</v>

3228
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:35.651
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3229
02:07:35.651 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

3230
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.090
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3231
02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:38.983
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you have to be registered </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a Democrat or Republican to vote in </v>

3232
02:07:41.051 --> 02:07:44.230
<v Speaker 3>the primaries and all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

3233
02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just</v>

3234
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:47.930
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

3235
02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:50.860
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is a big mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the flip side,</v>

3236
02:07:50.861 --> 02:07:53.530
<v Speaker 3>here's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump doesn't seem to be aging.</v>

3237
02:07:55.050 --> 02:07:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it says age is so hard.</v>

3238
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:00.123
<v Speaker 3>They age so hard because they're paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to everything and they have </v>

3239
02:08:02.771 --> 02:08:04.090
<v Speaker 3>real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3240
02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:05.313
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be just like I've fucking </v>

3241
02:08:07.241 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 3>water on a duck's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3242
02:08:08.741 --> 02:08:09.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's,</v>

3243
02:08:09.701 --> 02:08:10.534
<v Speaker 3>he's going to outlive with salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's figured out how to avoid the </v>

3244
02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:13.234
<v Speaker 3>stress.</v>

3245
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3246
02:08:14.421 --> 02:08:15.254
<v Speaker 1>you remember what prison Obama looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like when he finally walked out office </v>

3247
02:08:17.090 --> 02:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>or Bill Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw Bill Clinton not too long ago.</v>

3248
02:08:19.131 --> 02:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>We went down a little rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you saw him?</v>

3249
02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:22.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was at an event that we were </v>

3250
02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:26.540
<v Speaker 1>relatively small dinner and chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>

3251
02:08:28.230 --> 02:08:29.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying he touched me </v>

3252
02:08:29.581 --> 02:08:30.790
<v Speaker 3>inappropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3253
02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.600
<v Speaker 3>want to know where I got my burner </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

3254
02:08:33.601 --> 02:08:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Have to be a fly on the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3255
02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:38.330
<v Speaker 3>fly on the wall in a room with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3256
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I will say this much about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3257
02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started talking.</v>

3258
02:08:42.351 --> 02:08:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just going to go up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shake his hand and say,</v>

3259
02:08:44.191 --> 02:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey ms president,</v>

3260
02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:47.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to see you.</v>

3261
02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Because I always liked the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3262
02:08:49.491 --> 02:08:50.240
<v Speaker 1>And okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3263
02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from his obvious,</v>

3264
02:08:51.801 --> 02:08:54.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and the problem we had in terms of</v>

3265
02:08:54.171 --> 02:08:55.580
<v Speaker 1>his ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3266
02:08:55.581 --> 02:08:56.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3267
02:08:56.271 --> 02:08:58.760
<v Speaker 1>to govern and the fact that he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a smart son of a bitch.</v>

3268
02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

3269
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found him,</v>

3270
02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3271
02:09:04.190 --> 02:09:05.960
<v Speaker 1>capable of the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3272
02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I just like it did with President Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3273
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:08.833
<v Speaker 1>they were good aspects of president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I thought I have a dog in </v>

3274
02:09:10.521 --> 02:09:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3275
02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:12.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather see the results in the </v>

3276
02:09:13.041 --> 02:09:14.270
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

3277
02:09:14.271 --> 02:09:16.520
<v Speaker 1>talking to President Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3278
02:09:16.521 --> 02:09:17.354
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started talking and he immediately </v>

3279
02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:21.410
<v Speaker 1>went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old,</v>

3280
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:22.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agency,</v>

3281
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:23.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation and old thing that had </v>

3282
02:09:24.621 --> 02:09:28.700
<v Speaker 1>happened during his time when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>president to talk about it.</v>

3283
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And you could tell that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3284
02:09:31.791 --> 02:09:34.100
<v Speaker 1>he had retained a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

3285
02:09:34.101 --> 02:09:34.934
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were talking and we ended up </v>

3286
02:09:36.651 --> 02:09:37.484
<v Speaker 1>talking for 15 minutes or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of about this particular </v>

3287
02:09:39.651 --> 02:09:41.470
<v Speaker 1>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was kind of curious and he wanted</v>

3288
02:09:41.471 --> 02:09:42.110
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3289
02:09:42.110 --> 02:09:42.943
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to recount some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought process that they were going </v>

3290
02:09:45.411 --> 02:09:46.244
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3291
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and I found it really interesting in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that that was a,</v>

3292
02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.510
<v Speaker 1>it was a surprisingly deep conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3293
02:09:53.511 --> 02:09:54.344
<v Speaker 1>For any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's curious and I always thought </v>

3294
02:09:57.021 --> 02:10:00.620
<v Speaker 1>that was the most important quality for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who gets in that job is he's,</v>

3295
02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.450
<v Speaker 1>they have to be curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3296
02:10:02.451 --> 02:10:05.480
<v Speaker 1>They have to be inquisitive and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3297
02:10:05.810 --> 02:10:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the scale of,</v>

3298
02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>

3299
02:10:08.331 --> 02:10:09.950
<v Speaker 1>where does the current president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3300
02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:11.870
<v Speaker 1>exist in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the curiosity scale?</v>

3301
02:10:11.871 --> 02:10:12.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's probably not his </v>

3302
02:10:13.731 --> 02:10:14.564
<v Speaker 1>strong suit.</v>

3303
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not aging.</v>

3304
02:10:16.551 --> 02:10:18.260
<v Speaker 1>It's because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3305
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:19.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not asking that fourth or fifth </v>

3306
02:10:20.001 --> 02:10:21.500
<v Speaker 1>question that leads you to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go,</v>

3307
02:10:21.501 --> 02:10:22.334
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty fucked up situation now </v>

3308
02:10:23.121 --> 02:10:26.240
<v Speaker 1>we got to worry about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it is,</v>

3309
02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water off the back and he's,</v>

3310
02:10:27.801 --> 02:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3311
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:30.770
<v Speaker 1>he's figured out a way to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>

3312
02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3313
02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:32.423
<v Speaker 1>on the plus side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems to be making business owners </v>

3314
02:10:35.901 --> 02:10:36.734
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems at least ones that aren't </v>

3315
02:10:38.151 --> 02:10:41.000
<v Speaker 1>affected by the sanctions against China </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a,</v>

3316
02:10:41.001 --> 02:10:41.834
<v Speaker 1>there's like steel manufacturing and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of other companies that are very </v>

3317
02:10:43.971 --> 02:10:45.230
<v Speaker 1>upset by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3318
02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it's,</v>

3319
02:10:46.681 --> 02:10:47.514
<v Speaker 1>it's the regulations that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've done that they haven't </v>

3320
02:10:49.101 --> 02:10:50.240
<v Speaker 1>really touted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3321
02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 1>in terms of deregulating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that make us like the</v>

3322
02:10:52.971 --> 02:10:54.410
<v Speaker 1>previous administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3323
02:10:54.411 --> 02:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>a lot of good points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some bad points.</v>

3324
02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:58.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the bad points was a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3325
02:10:58.730 --> 02:10:59.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3326
02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:03.920
<v Speaker 1>hamstringing of industry through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>overregulation on everything.</v>

3327
02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so lifting some of that on,</v>

3328
02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

3329
02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:10.100
<v Speaker 1>you can argue whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3330
02:11:10.101 --> 02:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>you want bigger government and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

3331
02:11:11.571 --> 02:11:16.220
<v Speaker 1>but you can't argue with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it did unleashed a industry and business</v>

3332
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:19.790
<v Speaker 1>more than the previous administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing.</v>

3333
02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3334
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:23.000
<v Speaker 1>look at all the other concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3335
02:11:23.001 --> 02:11:23.834
<v Speaker 1>now we're talking about a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowdown because China's numbers are </v>

3336
02:11:26.841 --> 02:11:28.700
<v Speaker 1>looking soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's looking soft.</v>

3337
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:31.310
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's worried about brexit.</v>

3338
02:11:31.311 --> 02:11:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things for people to be</v>

3339
02:11:33.321 --> 02:11:34.520
<v Speaker 1>focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3340
02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:35.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I worry sometimes that all we do </v>

3341
02:11:37.371 --> 02:11:40.100
<v Speaker 1>here in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like chasing the next shiny</v>

3342
02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tin foil.</v>

3343
02:11:41.061 --> 02:11:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Cause we're all a bunch of raccoons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3344
02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:45.800
<v Speaker 1>We have such a short attention span for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3345
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:47.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3346
02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.190
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I saying?</v>

3347
02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

3348
02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:52.073
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

3349
02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about attention span.</v>

3350
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:56.630
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I'm going to definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk to you about,</v>

3351
02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:57.493
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up recently is the JFK case and </v>

3352
02:12:02.541 --> 02:12:03.374
<v Speaker 1>releasing some of the files and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to redact the information that </v>

3353
02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:11.000
<v Speaker 1>pertained to the people that were still </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

3354
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3355
02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think about the JFK </v>

3356
02:12:19.071 --> 02:12:19.904
<v Speaker 1>case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald </v>

3357
02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:22.700
<v Speaker 1>acted alone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3358
02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I can see</v>

3359
02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:31.340
<v Speaker 1>of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the sort of incidents of all,</v>

3360
02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to minimize it or minimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it by calling it an incident,</v>

3361
02:12:35.611 --> 02:12:39.570
<v Speaker 1>but of all those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kennedy assassination and Mlk,</v>

3362
02:12:39.571 --> 02:12:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King's assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the two that I understand more</v>

3363
02:12:43.081 --> 02:12:44.850
<v Speaker 1>than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they've linkerd,</v>

3364
02:12:44.851 --> 02:12:47.610
<v Speaker 1>why people don't believe the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've seen and why they,</v>

3365
02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:50.160
<v Speaker 1>why they have concerns about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3366
02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King more than Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there was something there</v>

3367
02:12:55.591 --> 02:12:56.424
<v Speaker 1>that we still don't understand in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of who else was responsible and who </v>

3368
02:12:58.681 --> 02:13:01.710
<v Speaker 1>organize that and who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who assisted in that.</v>

3369
02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think of those two.</v>

3370
02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:09.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the one I've got bigger questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Kennedy assassination.</v>

3371
02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3372
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that Oswald pulled the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in his mind,</v>

3373
02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:18.733
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason he was doing it was for the </v>

3374
02:13:21.781 --> 02:13:24.750
<v Speaker 1>greater good of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of communism and to,</v>

3375
02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boost his image with the Soviets and,</v>

3376
02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:28.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3377
02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>w with the Cuban regime.</v>

3378
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I think that he had assistance?</v>

3379
02:13:36.490 --> 02:13:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3380
02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could be swayed from that with,</v>

3381
02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:44.580
<v Speaker 1>with better evidence than I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3382
02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:47.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people are so dug in on</v>

3383
02:13:47.701 --> 02:13:48.271
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3384
02:13:48.271 --> 02:13:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3385
02:13:49.111 --> 02:13:50.490
<v Speaker 1>it was a massive event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3386
02:13:50.491 --> 02:13:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a massive event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Oswald had sufficient training.</v>

3387
02:13:54.031 --> 02:13:57.090
<v Speaker 1>You did not have to be a rocket </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist to figure this out.</v>

3388
02:13:57.091 --> 02:14:00.060
<v Speaker 1>It was a different era and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it in today's terms,</v>

3389
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>but when you get right in that position </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look out that window and look at the</v>

3390
02:14:04.501 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>shot that was taken and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was involved in that,</v>

3391
02:14:08.131 --> 02:14:08.964
<v Speaker 1>I was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3392
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've shot,</v>

3393
02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

3394
02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds terrible,</v>

3395
02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3396
02:14:13.410 --> 02:14:14.790
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3397
02:14:14.791 --> 02:14:16.260
<v Speaker 1>has taken a more difficult shot in that.</v>

3398
02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3399
02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:18.443
<v Speaker 1>so that part of it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his motivation and his past ties to </v>

3400
02:14:23.970 --> 02:14:24.803
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I think the Soviets were pulling the </v>

3401
02:14:25.681 --> 02:14:26.790
<v Speaker 1>trigger on it too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the mafia,</v>

3402
02:14:26.791 --> 02:14:27.640
<v Speaker 1>we're pulling the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3403
02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen anything that convinces </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that that was the case.</v>

3404
02:14:30.451 --> 02:14:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that Oswald felt like he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it for them or he was just,</v>

3405
02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>he was going to prove himself in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

3406
02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:37.613
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3407
02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:38.450
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3408
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people are dug in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mlk one,</v>

3409
02:14:40.681 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3410
02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:46.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

3411
02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he acted alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think that?</v>

3412
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

3413
02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:56.490
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a loser,</v>

3414
02:14:56.491 --> 02:14:58.380
<v Speaker 1>a two bit criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3415
02:14:58.381 --> 02:14:59.214
<v Speaker 1>Who was constantly getting picked up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shift that he was doing and ending </v>

3416
02:15:01.831 --> 02:15:03.570
<v Speaker 1>up in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was a mess,</v>

3417
02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:05.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing clever about him.</v>

3418
02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And then leading up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassination,</v>

3419
02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>he cleaned up his act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly he went from looking like a two</v>

3420
02:15:14.491 --> 02:15:15.030
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3421
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:18.870
<v Speaker 1>criminal and all to a college professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

3422
02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And he had cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was able to,</v>

3423
02:15:20.641 --> 02:15:21.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purchase a vehicle and he kind of went </v>

3424
02:15:23.341 --> 02:15:25.590
<v Speaker 1>off the grid for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went onto this drive,</v>

3425
02:15:25.591 --> 02:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sort of stayed off the grid.</v>

3426
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And he behaved in a way that he hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>up until,</v>

3427
02:15:32.130 --> 02:15:34.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>months before this thing took place.</v>

3428
02:15:35.010 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And then he ended up in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3429
02:15:37.411 --> 02:15:38.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3430
02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3431
02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.150
<v Speaker 1>something tells me that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3432
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assistance in some fashion.</v>

3433
02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who right or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>

3434
02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that more than than any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any others that I've looked at,</v>

3435
02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:56.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me step back and go,</v>

3436
02:15:56.941 --> 02:15:57.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

3437
02:15:57.450 --> 02:15:58.710
<v Speaker 1>we don't know the whole story here.</v>

3438
02:15:59.010 --> 02:16:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kennedy thing,</v>

3439
02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3440
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:02.213
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something out there that </v>

3441
02:16:02.851 --> 02:16:06.090
<v Speaker 1>we just haven't turned over a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always a possibility.</v>

3442
02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:06.980
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3443
02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:09.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mlk I think is a,</v>

3444
02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:11.490
<v Speaker 1>is that's the one that's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing.</v>

3445
02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:12.353
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about the mlk </v>

3446
02:16:13.921 --> 02:16:16.020
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to go look into that now.</v>

3447
02:16:16.021 --> 02:16:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you think that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>

3448
02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Look at his behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3449
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:24.230
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was his name again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Earl.</v>

3450
02:16:24.231 --> 02:16:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Ray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Earl Ray and I,</v>

3451
02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've interviewed his brother,</v>

3452
02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:29.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what,</v>

3453
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a show,</v>

3454
02:16:31.890 --> 02:16:34.340
<v Speaker 1>a series where we did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3455
02:16:34.390 --> 02:16:35.140
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3456
02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:37.430
<v Speaker 1>investigative look into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3457
02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:40.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3458
02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

3459
02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:43.680
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3460
02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:45.220
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all you do when you're,</v>

3461
02:16:45.221 --> 02:16:46.054
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at this is to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Ray's behavior in that year leading </v>

3462
02:16:51.281 --> 02:16:53.740
<v Speaker 1>up to the assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3463
02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:56.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the interesting for me,</v>

3464
02:16:56.951 --> 02:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>that's the most interesting part.</v>

3465
02:16:57.970 --> 02:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in context with everything he did</v>

3466
02:16:59.531 --> 02:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>up until that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

3467
02:17:00.491 --> 02:17:01.450
<v Speaker 1>he was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3468
02:17:01.451 --> 02:17:02.284
<v Speaker 1>just a two big criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stay out of jail and then you </v>

3469
02:17:05.321 --> 02:17:06.154
<v Speaker 1>get this and you get this change in </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and this change in the parents </v>

3470
02:17:08.441 --> 02:17:08.981
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3471
02:17:08.981 --> 02:17:10.710
<v Speaker 1>sudden ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3472
02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:11.913
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3473
02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.870
<v Speaker 1>something that he wasn't up until that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

3474
02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess everybody can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>

3475
02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:18.460
<v Speaker 1>that was the most striking part for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3476
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:21.850
<v Speaker 1>there's no obvious source of income?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3477
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:22.871
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3478
02:17:22.871 --> 02:17:23.704
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3479
02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:25.241
<v Speaker 1>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3480
02:17:25.241 --> 02:17:26.380

<v Speaker 1>just a penny.</v>

3481
02:17:26.381 --> 02:17:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Any criminal basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3482
02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:30.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was plenty of information.</v>

3483
02:17:30.101 --> 02:17:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like he couldn't have gathered</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

3484
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:32.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3485
02:17:32.771 --> 02:17:33.790
<v Speaker 1>he acted on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3486
02:17:33.791 --> 02:17:34.690
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3487
02:17:34.691 --> 02:17:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Was there information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3488
02:17:35.871 --> 02:17:36.704
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leading right up until the day </v>

3489
02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:39.270
<v Speaker 1>before there was talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3490
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:40.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were news reports showing a king </v>

3491
02:17:41.501 --> 02:17:43.360
<v Speaker 1>at the Lorraine Motel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3492
02:17:43.361 --> 02:17:45.520
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in and out of the room,</v>

3493
02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:46.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was staying in and so it wasn't </v>

3494
02:17:49.391 --> 02:17:49.961
<v Speaker 1>as if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3495
02:17:49.961 --> 02:17:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't gather that information on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own,</v>

3496
02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was again,</v>

3497
02:17:53.921 --> 02:17:57.310
<v Speaker 1>it was that behavior leading up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not a conspiracy guy at all.</v>

3498
02:17:57.340 --> 02:17:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen too much shit to,</v>

3499
02:17:59.950 --> 02:18:00.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that,</v>

3500
02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every conspiracy home water.</v>

3501
02:18:02.891 --> 02:18:03.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3502
02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:06.370
<v Speaker 1>but this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was disturbing in that regard.</v>

3503
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:07.833
<v Speaker 1>What that's worth,</v>

3504
02:18:08.410 --> 02:18:10.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3505
02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:11.760
<v Speaker 3>You should look into it and we'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about next time.</v>

3506
02:18:11.761 --> 02:18:12.540
<v Speaker 3>See what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>

3507
02:18:12.540 --> 02:18:13.950
<v Speaker 3>I'd really be interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3508
02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're going to this show </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're gonna get ready to do here.</v>

3509
02:18:17.370 --> 02:18:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Start filming in next month is not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be looking into things like that.</v>

3510
02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:22.620
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it called?</v>

3511
02:18:22.621 --> 02:18:23.454
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be called black files.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may change the number or the name </v>

3512
02:18:25.561 --> 02:18:27.210
<v Speaker 3>just before we go on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3513
02:18:27.390 --> 02:18:29.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed the shows that I did in</v>

3514
02:18:29.581 --> 02:18:31.190
<v Speaker 3>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American declassified with the,</v>

3515
02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:31.860
<v Speaker 3>they're looking into</v>

3516
02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:33.630
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed it.</v>

3517
02:18:34.050 --> 02:18:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I really thought it was fascinating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I get why people feel that way.</v>

3518
02:18:38.890 --> 02:18:39.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy for sure when they're on the </v>

3519
02:18:41.111 --> 02:18:42.240
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Kennedy wanted,</v>

3520
02:18:42.241 --> 02:18:44.110
<v Speaker 3>to me the bullet is the most disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3521
02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:44.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pool would that just showed up on </v>

3522
02:18:45.701 --> 02:18:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Connolly's Gurney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look where we found.</v>

3523
02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:48.664
<v Speaker 3>We found this spot and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>distorted and supposedly went through </v>

3524
02:18:51.431 --> 02:18:53.890
<v Speaker 3>two people and shattered bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That magic bullet.</v>

3525
02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:56.420
<v Speaker 3>The magic bullet yet it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>

3526
02:18:56.421 --> 02:18:58.120
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that that bullet came </v>
<v Speaker 3>from there.</v>

3527
02:18:58.150 --> 02:19:00.690
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the most of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So cause we looked at the,</v>

3528
02:19:00.691 --> 02:19:01.524
<v Speaker 3>the grassy knoll issue and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of spot hitting other kids </v>

3529
02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:04.330
<v Speaker 3>from the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3530
02:19:04.510 --> 02:19:05.343
<v Speaker 3>The fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got bullet doesn't pull it drives </v>

3531
02:19:07.181 --> 02:19:08.014
<v Speaker 3>me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does that there's more pieces of the </v>

3532
02:19:09.551 --> 02:19:10.384
<v Speaker 3>bullet fragments in connally's body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the look at the x rays </v>

3533
02:19:13.181 --> 02:19:15.400
<v Speaker 3>of Conley's bodies that show bullet </v>
<v Speaker 3>fragments,</v>

3534
02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 3>there's little pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found a little tiny pieces of metal</v>

3535
02:19:18.611 --> 02:19:20.510
<v Speaker 3>in his body from the bullet fragments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

3536
02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:22.510
<v Speaker 3>But you don't see that missing from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>

3537
02:19:22.511 --> 02:19:23.830
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3538
02:19:23.831 --> 02:19:24.820
<v Speaker 3>The bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bullet thing is,</v>

3539
02:19:24.821 --> 02:19:25.810
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3540
02:19:25.811 --> 02:19:27.410
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3541
02:19:27.411 --> 02:19:27.951
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3542
02:19:27.951 --> 02:19:28.310
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

3543
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:33.310
<v Speaker 1>elements of it that you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but collectively I just,</v>

3544
02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

3545
02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:35.894
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something else out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there is and we just haven't </v>

3546
02:19:38.091 --> 02:19:40.520
<v Speaker 1>uncovered it or maybe this will prompt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3547
02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:41.840
<v Speaker 1>some additional information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

3548
02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:42.930
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3549
02:19:43.450 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3550
02:19:44.781 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating shit.</v>

3551
02:19:46.191 --> 02:19:48.340
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do get it because it's so,</v>

3552
02:19:48.390 --> 02:19:50.330
<v Speaker 1>it was such a seminal moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3553
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And nobody wants to think that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bad,</v>

3554
02:19:52.881 --> 02:19:53.714
<v Speaker 1>that horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that could sort of </v>

3555
02:19:54.861 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>shatter the country in that fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be done by one,</v>

3556
02:19:57.770 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 1>one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Lee Harvey Oswald or John Hinckley.</v>

3557
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Hinckley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3558
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:03.283
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3559
02:20:03.490 --> 02:20:05.360
<v Speaker 1>We just let him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3560
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:07.393
<v Speaker 1>Not for good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3561
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.233
<v Speaker 1>Not for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on a release program of </v>

3562
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Outta here for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck outta here forever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how well you've been behaving for 20 </v>

3564
02:20:18.321 --> 02:20:18.680
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3565

<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

3567
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:25.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is wrong with people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3568
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:25.930
