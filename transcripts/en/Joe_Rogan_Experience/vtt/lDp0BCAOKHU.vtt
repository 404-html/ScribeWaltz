<v Speaker 1>daddy thing.</v>

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I had to strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right use the day.</v>

5
00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>She had a sugar daddy and she would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy them all a pile of shit,</v>

6
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>which is great because I didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy it and then I got that appointment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to put up with their shit.</v>

13

<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she'd come home with a VCR.</v>

<v Speaker 1>friend and bad mouth myself for an hour</v>

20
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went to a mall and I picked out</v>

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.510

<v Speaker 1>I forget it was like a Walkman at the</v>

<v Speaker 1>time or something like that.</v>

25
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:46.711

<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

26
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>You seem like a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking bad.</v>

27
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>My Mike and the guys holding her hand in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limo and I'm just sitting there like</v>

28
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>the friend of my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>

29
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting cds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong pimp move.</v>

30
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get a TV but he wasn't going</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

31
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocket like this,</v>

32
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they have two is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of prostitution laws.</v>

33
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>If prostitution was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of these older,</v>

34
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>creepy dudes that are just out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make it happen.</v>

35
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>It just tough action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>unless you're paying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very tough to get someone love you for</v>

37
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had these really high</v>

38
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:25.970
<v Speaker 1>standards and your gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

39
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got a ton of cash and</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitution's legal,</v>

40
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>if they just made prostitution legal in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

41
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you'd have exactly the same amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hose.</v>

42
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same.</v>

43
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna know.</v>

44
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>More people are not going to be hoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoes are hoes are ready.</v>

45
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing it in weird ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it'd be better.</v>

46
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Prostitution was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you found out exactly who the</v>

47
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>tax it will pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

48
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Amazon one click stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with it.</v>

49
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to go get a massage?</v>

50
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to pay someone to suck your</v>

51
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>

52
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>

53
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys shouldn't have to move</v>

54
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>these fucking girls biocar.</v>

55
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>That's rude by the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends.</v>

56
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Vcrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have to do it.</v>

57
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad just he's trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figured he's trying to bang my check so</v>

58
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>at least I should get some gifts out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

59
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you wind up ending this whole</v>

60
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>it was a stripper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just.</v>

62
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got</v>

63
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.180
<v Speaker 1>him out of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like he would want some return</v>

64
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>for his investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing what he was juggling,</v>

65
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>like three different ones and he just</v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

66
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I think he was fucking won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted the fuck all three of</v>

67
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my chick had boundaries</v>

68
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>while she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said she was no way.</v>

70
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sleep with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's true.</v>

71
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>But he bought her tickets to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wanted me to buy her textbook for a</v>

72
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.720
<v Speaker 1>brand.</v>

73
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find your tits.</v>

74
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And he bought her tits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tits.</v>

75
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

77
00:02:58.221 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to dinner that just that night.</v>

78
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I only met him that one time I'd be at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bardo because you know the sugar</v>

79
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:06.480
<v Speaker 1>daddy always comes into strip club and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sits there and all the girls come out.</v>

80
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I was right across the bar just sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>there just watching this guy.</v>

81
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking that tonight.</v>

82
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.870

<v Speaker 1>She take a meter to diner.</v>

83
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>She's taking me to dinner later with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>

84
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the guy.</v>

85
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>When the always people always talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alec Strippers,</v>

86
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>crazy boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

87
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central one,</v>

88
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>and I was like cutting lawns at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

89
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I was making like eight bucks an hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy said this guy is probably</v>

90
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>like 300 grand a year.</v>

91
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>He just created a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coen brothers movies are my ultimate</v>

93
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>favorite movies of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I saw Donald Trump was running</v>

94
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>for president the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

95
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>we live in a Cohen brothers movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's official because his fucking Slob,</v>

96
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>this goofy Slob is going to run his ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pouring out of his ears.</v>

97
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>He ever met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

98
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Weird dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure we met him.</v>

99
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>We did something on top gear where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were trying to convince him to like pick</v>

100
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>one of these cars that we had each pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the celebrity and we found out like</v>

101
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>halfway through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for Donald Trump.</v>

102
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.350
<v Speaker 1>And he basically was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>this guy looks gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's looking at tanner.</v>

104
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this car,</v>

105
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you look gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the car's probably for a gay person</v>

106
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>and whatever tailored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what kind of car he had</v>

107
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>picked potatoes.</v>

108
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did y'all tell?</v>

109
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell Donald Trump to make fun of</v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

110
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:17.074
<v Speaker 1>That I look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean,</v>

111
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that's just what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

112
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>he just went for it and then he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

113
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take yours.</v>

114
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Was He trying to be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was,</v>

115
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>but he's one of those people that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think he can hear other people.</v>

116
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe he can read lips a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

117
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but like he walks into the room and all</v>

<v Speaker 1>billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real estate mogul has his name on every</v>

<v Speaker 1>sort of an attitude.</v>

178
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay there history,</v>

179
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:59.280
<v Speaker 1>put us up there once for the upfronts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I opened the little like mini bar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his face was on the vodka</v>

181
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

182
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feels like too much bro.</v>

183
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you gotta draw the line</v>

184
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you just go for it.</v>

185
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>It would just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just keep going like the further</v>

186
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>and deeper you go into the crazy ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming pool becomes like warmer water</v>

187
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>because like it gets better is that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be like the Walt Disney of total</v>

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>douche bag real estate moguls.</v>

189
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.050

194
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I met Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of,</v>

195
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

198
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

199
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>because they just don't beat meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

200

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was a bit like that and I seen him at</v>

202
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 1>k one because I did k one in Los Angeles</v>
<v Speaker 1>while ago.</v>

203
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

204
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles bad then what you come across on</v>

205
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're much better person than what you</v>

206
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of still come with them.</v>

207
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>They made me a friend on facebook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that concept and said,</v>

208
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>do you want me to work with you anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

209
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>she'll cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we got on.</v>

210
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>He's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He picks things up so quickly.</v>

211
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>He's so open to stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

212
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>we've done some really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool stuff.</v>

213
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:31.480
<v Speaker 1>That's I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can experiment on Joe,</v>

214
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes sense.</v>

215
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things that I want to try.</v>

216
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I n a dude him and he seems to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well in him.</v>

217
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you give us an example,</v>

218
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:41.670
<v Speaker 1>like what do you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things that you want to explore</v>

219
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 1>that it's really strange but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

220
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I had to think about because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean lish have a gala hot date night.</v>

221
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It got to the knights of the roundtable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king author on Joe didn't want to get</v>

222
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.230
<v Speaker 1>injured because he was going to fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>

223
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Robert something or other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on glory and then he was going to</v>

224
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:05.811
<v Speaker 1>fight on ballots or against Melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not have any way to come out on scathed.</v>

225
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>So we persuaded his unconscious mind.</v>

226
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.480
<v Speaker 1>So I've armor likes the Gullah hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I talked and Gnosis about the</v>

227
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>archetype of Knights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Knights,</v>

228
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.941
<v Speaker 1>of the round table and he will a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not literally obviously,</v>

229
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.180
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had armor so he didn't come.</v>

230
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.520
<v Speaker 1>So we'd come out on injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's going to work for</v>

232
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
