00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Think about how much of our lives are influenced,</v>

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>how much of our society is built on services that bring pleasure to our senses.</v>

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Our sense of touch.</v>

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>We can go,</v>

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>you go get a massage.</v>

7
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.841
<v Speaker 1>Damn right.</v>

8
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>You can know the right place.</v>

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

10
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>our sense of taste there is food brought to its high cuisine,</v>

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Our sense of hearing.</v>

13
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>we make beautiful music,</v>

16
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>our sense of sight.</v>

17
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>We make great art.</v>

18
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So much of what we do is to satisfy our five traditional senses.</v>

19
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if we had 10 sensors or 20.</v>

20
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory on that.</v>

21
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It's called the fart principle.</v>

22
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I have no understanding of how that principal could relate to this,</v>

23
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but I'm all ears.</v>

24
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.993
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>

25
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>if you did not have a nose and you could live your whole life without a sense of</v>

27
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>smell in the year 2012,</v>

28
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible if you'd,</v>

29
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>if someone foreign in front of you,</v>

30
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you'd have no idea that this terrible gas is,</v>

31
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you're inhaling,</v>

32
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>it's in your note.</v>

33
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have that sense of smell.</v>

34
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So you could exist and not have any idea because gas is invisible.</v>

35
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad example and I'll tell you why.</v>

37
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

38
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

39
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

40
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>It could be alien life form all around us all the time that we don't have the</v>

41
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>sense to like,</v>

42
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like worms can't see,</v>

43
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.953
<v Speaker 1>but we can.</v>

44
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 1>So to the two things,</v>

45
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:21.794
<v Speaker 1>so first,</v>

46
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.671
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

48
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a good example in the sense that no pun intended in the sense of that</v>

49
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.823
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

50
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>if who knows what senses were missing and therefore who knows what there is to</v>

51
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>measure in our world around us that we are completely missing.</v>

52
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

53
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.463
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

54
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Get back to that in a minute.</v>

55
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Regarding your fart theory.</v>

56
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

57
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.053
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

58
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

59
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

60
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>my theories of for a peer review,</v>

61
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>it is totally getting peer reviewed.</v>

62
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>The good life.</v>

63
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the right thing to call it too.</v>

64
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a legitimate hypothesis.</v>

65
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

66
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>It's out on the table now.</v>

67
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:52.101
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>

68
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You're ready.</v>

69
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.653
<v Speaker 1>It's my life's work.</v>

70
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the active ingredients in the smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide.</v>

71
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>It turns out hydrogen sulfide is extremely lethal.</v>

72
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Is One of the most lethal gasses that exists.</v>

73
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>why do we have such a good sense of smell for that?</v>

75
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we smell other gay?</v>

76
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we smell nitrogen?</v>

77
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to smell nitrogen because it's not going to kill us because it's</v>

79
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>78% of what you breathe.</v>

80
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:29.964
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

81
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] we have evolved a hypersensitive sense for the smell of hydrogen</v>

82
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:39.894
<v Speaker 1>sulfide.</v>

83
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

84
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

85
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>if there was a gender,</v>

86
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>if you gave birth to someone who said,</v>

87
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful and let's smell more of it,</v>

88
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>let's get canisters of it.</v>

89
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.381
<v Speaker 1>They're dead.</v>

90
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes later,</v>

91
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>no longer able to propagate the gene that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide.</v>

92
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>We had to not like that smell.</v>

93
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we would not have survived.</v>

94
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

95
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.561
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:05.921
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

97
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of the,</v>

98
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>the digestive activity of anaerobic microbes.</v>

99
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why it comes out of your lower intestine with not only where the sun</v>

100
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.041
<v Speaker 1>don't shine,</v>

101
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>where oxygen doesn't exist,</v>

102
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>the microbes to thrive down there.</v>

103
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>They are an aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is one of their byproducts.</v>

104
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>It has been theorized that there have been places and times on earth where the</v>

105
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:41.101
<v Speaker 1>ocean currents stopped and when ocean current stop oxygen at the surface of the</v>

106
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>ocean never makes it to the bottom.</v>

107
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>So you can't sustain oxygen life forms at the bottom of the ocean.</v>

108
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>There are no fish,</v>

109
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be any fishes down there if the ocean currents stopped because</v>

110
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>the ocean currents not only go from one place to another in the world they</v>

111
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>

112
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>they circulate top to bottom.</v>

113
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.661
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

114
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>so it's a two dimensional thing going on in three dimensions actually.</v>

115
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

116
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>so if something happens on earth where you stop the oceanic cycles,</v>

117
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you can create a condition in the lower ocean,</v>

118
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>we're anaerobic lifeforms thrive.</v>

119
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>If they thrive,</v>

120
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>they out gas and one of the out gases is hydrogen sulfide.</v>

121
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It will gurgle up from the bottom of the ocean,</v>

122
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>rise up near the shores,</v>

123
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>turning shorelines into the smell of cesspools.</v>

124
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>If you were alive at the time and didn't run away from that,</v>

125
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you would have simply died from it.</v>

126
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>That is all well and good.</v>

127
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Therefore the nose,</v>

128
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the nose theory that if we didn't have a nose,</v>

129
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>we could all just fart and we didn't have a nose.</v>

130
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't have noticed hydrogen sulfide and humans would not have survived it</v>

131
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and some other creature would be having this interview right now.</v>

132
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I not gree with you and disagree with you at the same time.</v>

133
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

134
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.710
<v Speaker 1>here's why what you're saying involves real people and real life adaptation to</v>

135
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.694
<v Speaker 1>our environment.</v>

136
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>What I'm talking about is aliens that are just like farts.</v>

137
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>That's why so you gave me a crazy long winded,</v>

138
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>really an in depth explanation,</v>

139
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>but you still don't discredit the possibility that just like the sense of smell,</v>

140
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>it exists,</v>

141
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>but it is invisible.</v>

142
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>There could be many things around us that are also invisible,</v>

143
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but we have not developed any means to detect down.</v>

144
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>You were being metaphor.</v>

146
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:35.914
<v Speaker 1>She works right.</v>

147
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Wifi.</v>

148
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.021
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

149
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:38.010
<v Speaker 1>But he was a bit swing.</v>

150
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>So you being metaphorical with your father sang live.</v>

151
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 1>No one would have had to have a nose.</v>

152
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I overanalyze it down.</v>

153
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.023
<v Speaker 1>That was cool.</v>

154
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

155
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

156
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.671
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

157
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.240
<v Speaker 1>one global warming scenario is the yes.</v>

158
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>You see the day after tomorrow.</v>

159
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

160
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably horrible.</v>

161
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.893
<v Speaker 1>That one was,</v>

163
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.740
<v Speaker 1>was that went to no clothes.</v>

164
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

165
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Who was bad when there was the cancer baby and everybody else is dead outside,</v>

166
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>but there she's surviving with the cancer baby and she's going to stay there for</v>

167
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:12.070
<v Speaker 1>the kid.</v>

168
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.210
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

169
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>while 100 billion people are dead.</v>

170
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome,</v>

171
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>let me get back to your nose.</v>

172
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Your partner crazy.</v>

173
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

174
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

175
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You're probably not right.</v>

176
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not right.</v>

178
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.921
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

179
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a ridiculous idea.</v>

180
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.171
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

181
00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:26.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

182
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

183
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

184
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:26.561
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

185
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

186
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.781
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

187
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

188
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>But there's a reason why you're probably not.</v>

189
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

190
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Because beginning in the 16 hundreds,</v>

192
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.140
<v Speaker 1>we learned that our senses are not only,</v>

193
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>they not only fool us,</v>

194
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>they and occasionally don't work.</v>

195
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Speaker 1>They're not all that the universe tells us is they are not,</v>

196
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the capacity to recognize all that's going on in the universe.</v>

197
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

198
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>certainly on a microscopic level.</v>

199
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>that's my point.</v>

201
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.021
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>

202
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>So in the early 16 hundreds to the important advances,</v>

203
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>actually late 1500 you had the invention of the microscope and you had the</v>

205
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>invention of the telescope.</v>

206
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>This is really the first steps to enhance our senses beyond what our human</v>

207
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.300
<v Speaker 1>biology in doubt us with.</v>

208
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And upon doing so,</v>

209
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>we discovered things about the world that were previously oblivious to us.</v>

210
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.751
<v Speaker 1>We discovered,</v>

211
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>knows farts when you wouldn't leave.</v>

212
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:40.741
<v Speaker 1>When hoke brought his telescope and his microscope to up drop of pond water and</v>

213
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>saw what we were called Anna macules.</v>

214
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.680
<v Speaker 1>What else were you going to call it?</v>

215
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 1>The little things,</v>

216
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 1>paramecium had protozoa thriving in a drop of water.</v>

217
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 1>That was a nose for it.</v>

218
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Keeping with your vocabulary.</v>

219
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>That was something that previously no one had any idea was there.</v>

220
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And my point is,</v>

221
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.801
<v Speaker 1>beginning in 1600 and with an ever improving march forward,</v>

222
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the methods and tools of science have served to enhance our senses,</v>

223
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>increase our senses,</v>

224
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>increased the range of our senses,</v>

225
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

226
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.670
<v Speaker 1>give us whole kinds of senses that your five senses could have never even</v>

227
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>imagined that our human biology couldn't even approximate.</v>

228
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.700
<v Speaker 1>So as so,</v>

229
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>so what's an example?</v>

230
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.723
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

231
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

232
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

233
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>we don't have senses to detect magnetic field at all.</v>

234
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can sit in a Mri Chamber and sit there and you know,</v>

235
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea the strength of the magnetic field that's</v>

236
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>being cast across your body.</v>

237
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't have sensors for it.</v>

238
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't have sensors for radio?</v>

239
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

240
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>we're radio waves.</v>

241
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:56.994
<v Speaker 1>What the,</v>

242
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 1>the difference there is we do have sensors for one aspect of the electromagnetic</v>

243
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>

244
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 1>We have sensors for infrared,</v>

245
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.240
<v Speaker 1>visible and a delayed since for ultraviolet.</v>

246
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean?</v>

247
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

248
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>

249
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.051
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty loud.</v>

250
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And creative ringtone.</v>

251
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.143
<v Speaker 1>Just like mine,</v>

252
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I learned that aren't dangerous.</v>

253
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.380
<v Speaker 1>He goes old school.</v>

254
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

255
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.863
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

256
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

257
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

258
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>so the point is the radio waves are part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.</v>

259
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

260
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 1>we have access to some of that and we call that for obvious reasons.</v>

261
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.033
<v Speaker 1>Visible light,</v>

262
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

263
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>But outside of the range of visible light,</v>

264
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you have ultraviolet x rays,</v>

265
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:35.521
<v Speaker 1>gamma rays,</v>

266
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.241
<v Speaker 1>radio waves,</v>

267
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>microwaves.</v>

268
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

269
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>we can't see radio waves,</v>

270
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>but that would just be an extension of our senses in the way.</v>

271
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Jordy in Star Trek,</v>

272
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 1>the next generation had his visor though that visor allowed him to see the</v>

273
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:50.960
<v Speaker 1>entire school star track on.</v>

274
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

275
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I had to go there just because I had uh,</v>

276
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.580
<v Speaker 1>and my sideburns or star Trek sideburns.</v>

277
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he,</v>

278
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>so he puts the,</v>

280
00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>

281
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>that visor enabled him to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum.</v>

282
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.950
<v Speaker 1>If we were thusly equipped,</v>

283
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>you'd walk down the street and the microwave towers would be ablaze with</v>

284
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>microwaves and you tune into sort of ultraviolet.</v>

285
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

286
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you'd think twice about going to the beach because that's the stuff that gives</v>

287
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you skin cancer,</v>

288
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.920
<v Speaker 1>especially people with lighter skin.</v>

289
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

290
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

291
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

292
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see,</v>

293
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

294
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.361
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

295
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>A good example if you want to see if there's a burglar entering your house,</v>

296
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>just shift over to infrared.</v>

297
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>If the burglar is warm blooded,</v>

298
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 1>they will show up even if all the lights around like the Predator.</v>

299
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:33.961
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

300
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>

301
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.071
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

302
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>It's another way to detect the light.</v>

303
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

304
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.180
<v Speaker 1>so we have,</v>

305
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:44.181
<v Speaker 1>so science has broadened our senses and given a sense is that our human biology</v>

306
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 1>could not have even thought of or invented.</v>

307
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.570
<v Speaker 1>So the notion at this day and age that something is happening on this tabletop</v>

308
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that is eluding us,</v>

309
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I think is just simply unlikely because we're so good now at finding things that</v>

310
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.404
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>

311
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.583
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

312
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>escaped our notice right in front of us right now.</v>

313
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>That frontier is that the energy extremes of the cern accelerator in</v>

314
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

315
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 1>that frontier is at the James Webb space telescope where we're going to look at</v>

316
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>the earliest formation of matter in the history of the universe.</v>

317
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 1>These are the extremes of our measurements of nature today.</v>

318
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

319
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking human being.</v>
