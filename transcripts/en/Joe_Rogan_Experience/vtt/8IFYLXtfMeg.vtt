00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.001
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so cool seeing that and for me </v>

<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

123
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the same guy that did </v>
<v Speaker 1>the monitor girl from London.</v>

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>she said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's rumored that you spent $750,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>one year on drugs.</v>

293
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:52.711
<v Speaker 1>and that was back when Clint Eastwood </v>
<v Speaker 1>was stuck with that one chick.</v>

294
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:53.790
<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sondra Locke.</v>

295
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if did a million movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this freak,</v>

296
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just this girl and they did a </v>

297
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 1>bunch of movies together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as they broke up,</v>

298
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 1>mad shit got ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

299
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got her like some development deal,</v>

300
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from home and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

301
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>and she accused him of blocking every </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of her projects.</v>

302
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't fuck with Clinton.</v>

303
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.970
<v Speaker 1>She was suing the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just gross man.</v>

304
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:20.971
<v Speaker 1>It was just when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people like divorce and they do it </v>

305
00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:24.331
<v Speaker 1>publicly like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose so much respect for the more </v>

306
00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 1>vocal member of the two.</v>

307
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the case with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with her.</v>

308
00:13:27.801 --> 00:13:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I automatically assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this bitch is crazy.</v>

309
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She never really worked again.</v>

310
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sondra Locke disappeared.</v>

311
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:35.560
<v Speaker 1>She was in a ton of movies with Clint </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastwood,</v>

312
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 1>but that was about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

313
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought it was because he </v>

314
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:42.950
<v Speaker 1>blackballed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people,</v>

315
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of us probably as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought she was gross,</v>

316
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.340
<v Speaker 1>like you know what's going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do in a clip?</v>

317
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

321
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you do?</v>

322
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine the stories that he has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

323
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And I remember even when we played like </v>

329
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.720
<v Speaker 1>realized man to Reno that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was it.</v>

330
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I lived next door to like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

333
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>it's an old time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this shit is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

337
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.010

<v Speaker 1>back in my day,</v>

338
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.510

<v Speaker 1>we would just laugh about it,</v>

341
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:44.761
<v Speaker 1>like we could tell jokes to people about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their race and people wouldn't freak </v>

342
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You'll come from it in my mind of a </v>

351
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 4>minority and then stop at minor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how tired I am.</v>

352
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 4>I think that for a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>give minorities,</v>

353
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're black people can make fun</v>

354
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 4>of white people all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

355
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.830
<v Speaker 4>you're walking a fine line where we make</v>
<v Speaker 4>fun of black.</v>

356
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen you do some great black jokes </v>

357
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 4>and I see people go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

358
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 4>See pl like the clench.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Because people worry.</v>

360
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:29.900
<v Speaker 4>People worry when a white guy makes fun </v>
<v Speaker 4>of black people,</v>

361
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 4>it gets to be a real black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People can make fun of white people.</v>

362
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 4>I've seen white people laugh at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lamest shit.</v>

363
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 4>They'll at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

364
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 4>it's like a guilty last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this weird.</v>

365
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 4>They do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fake white guy and voice.</v>

366
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like a rip off of the Richard Pryor</v>
<v Speaker 4>White Guy Voice.</v>

367
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 4>We're Richard Pryor was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a really unique thing.</v>

368
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:49.050
<v Speaker 4>We'd say,</v>

<v Speaker 4>voice and everybody's sort of stole it.</v>

374
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 4>They stole it and a lot of it are </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And they get,</v>

378
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give a horrible example.</v>

379
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.940
<v Speaker 4>It's silly man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could Ip,</v>

380
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 4>but you can tell white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

381

382
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.830

<v Speaker 4>So for a lot of black guys,</v>

383
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 4>like especially when they're first </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting out in up,</v>

384
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 4>that's the first thing they go to.</v>

385
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't that one of those things that </v>

386
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 4>you see and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

387
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 4>he's going there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

388
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

389
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Unless you see it done like supremely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

390
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 4>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there has to be like a super good </v>

391
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 4>example for you to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

392
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 4>And if the observation is really student</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're like that,</v>

393
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.820
<v Speaker 4>that's some insight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

394
00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:42.821
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're picking apart something new or </v>

395
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:42.821
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it and like you're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of it that I haven't heard,</v>

396
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 4>but everything else has been done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

397
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:46.580
<v Speaker 4>so like will there always being </v>
<v Speaker 4>minorities?</v>

398
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's ever going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>point where we're all just gray,</v>

399
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 4>like a turn that would take that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>color that's happening?</v>

400
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Like race is becoming more really more </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed across the board,</v>

401
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Speaker 4>do you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh definitely.</v>

402
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are people attracted to blonde </v>

403
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:04.920
<v Speaker 4>girls?</v>

404
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we talked about this.</v>

405
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.760
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm not attracted to as </v>
<v Speaker 4>blonde eyelashes and blond eyebrows.</v>

406
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm not attracted to blonde girls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm attracted to blonde girls to do shit</v>

407
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 4>with her eyelashes and eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked blondes the most.</v>

408
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 4>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any funny though?</v>

409
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird or girls who don't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

410
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:21.590
<v Speaker 4>like girls who have naturally brown </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyebrows.</v>

411
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why they usually I gravitate.</v>

412
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.900
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I don't like at all though is like </v>

413
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.690
<v Speaker 4>bleached.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

414
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:32.120
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not to be natural.</v>

415
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.240
<v Speaker 4>I like all kinds of blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of times when you would </v>

416
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.890
<v Speaker 4>take a girl that's like brown hair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some weird color brown,</v>

417
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.900
<v Speaker 4>he make her blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's always hot or if she's like nice </v>

418
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 4>bleached blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what's really freaking me out?</v>

419
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:49.331
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amount of people that are putting shit </v>

420
00:17:49.331 --> 00:17:49.331
<v Speaker 4>in their face.</v>

421
00:17:49.331 --> 00:17:49.350
<v Speaker 4>Amount of people that are probably like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fillers in their face.</v>

422
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the implants.</v>

423
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 4>It's becoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not even cheek implants.</v>

424
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.980
<v Speaker 4>That's what I thought they were too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought like,</v>

425
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.680
<v Speaker 4>remember when Mickey work did that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mickey work losses.</v>

426
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Fucking marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that in the nineties I guess he</v>

427
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.050
<v Speaker 4>had implants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he get implants?</v>

428
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>

429
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 4>And got them removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he had chicken plants and he looked </v>

430
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

431
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 4>I think what happened was that's when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was boxing and when he.</v>

432
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.990
<v Speaker 4>He had a pretty intense like segment of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his life where he just boxed and he </v>

433
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:22.840
<v Speaker 4>boxed professionally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got his fucking brains rattled too.</v>

434
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 4>He looks like it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that changed him as a </v>

435
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

436
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 4>I think it made him this wacky </v>
<v Speaker 4>eccentric,</v>

437
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 4>like remember Gary Busey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a regular dude.</v>

438
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Crashes motorcycle becomes this wacky </v>
<v Speaker 4>eccentric.</v>

439
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Totally crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

440
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 4>He used to be this really brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 4>actor,</v>

441
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 4>really talented actor like Mr Joshua.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>

442
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 4>And fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What movie was that?</v>

444
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.350
<v Speaker 4>We burned himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I forget Bruce Willis movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it was pulp fiction.</v>

446
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.320

448
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary Busey.</v>

449
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 4>He's not in pulp fiction and he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think it's from liberty city.</v>

452
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my point was lethal weapon.</v>

453
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Was that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary Busey was in.</v>

455
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Was it lethal weapon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

456
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 4>One of them was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

457

<v Speaker 4>it was lethal weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on,</v>

458
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.320
<v Speaker 4>let's take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

459
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a good fucking mood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The creighton there.</v>

460
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.190

464
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:35.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's also what </v>

465
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.020
<v Speaker 4>happened to Mickey Rourke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

466
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.480
<v Speaker 4>he's a regular dude and he got so crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he'd decided to be a good idea to </v>

467

<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make you look better.</v>

497
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.910
<v Speaker 4>I look crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

498
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the weirdest thing ever.</v>

499
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 4>That frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So puffy face,</v>

500
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're,</v>

501
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 4>they're injecting things into their face</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when you get older,</v>

502
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:09.451
<v Speaker 4>the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first things that happens to your face </v>

503
00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:09.451
<v Speaker 4>starts to lose body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you get like sorta sunk,</v>

504
00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 4>gain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrinkly,</v>

505
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

506
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 4>they're injecting things in their puff </v>
<v Speaker 4>it up.</v>

507
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

508
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she looks wild.</v>

509
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:19.540
<v Speaker 4>Then she'd look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a monster face.</v>

510
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I see these women,</v>

511
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I call the monster faces because you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>them all the time and it's like,</v>

512
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 4>it really is just a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

513
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.620
<v Speaker 4>it's a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't do it.</v>

514
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 4>It's out of such a fear of what would it</v>
<v Speaker 4>look like?</v>

515
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll react.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to look old,</v>

516
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 4>so they'd rather look crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also you convince yourself that</v>

517
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 4>you could fix something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

518
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:43.381
<v Speaker 4>I got hair transplants and I totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>wish I'd never done it because I have </v>

519
00:21:43.381 --> 00:21:43.381
<v Speaker 4>this stupid scar in the back of my head </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

520
00:21:43.381 --> 00:21:47.971
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise I would shave my head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got it because I was convinced </v>

521
00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 4>that I could fix something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my hair was falling out.</v>

522
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:53.191
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do I fix this certain way to fix </v>

523
00:21:53.191 --> 00:21:53.191
<v Speaker 4>this research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways to fix this.</v>

524
00:21:53.191 --> 00:21:53.191
<v Speaker 4>You talked to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can fix it and he,</v>

525
00:21:53.191 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can fix it.</v>

526
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

527
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll just get it fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't fix it.</v>

528
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 4>It fixes it temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all the other hair falls out of it.</v>

529
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 4>The way I described it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

530
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're taking a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy people and you're moving them to</v>

531
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:06.050
<v Speaker 4>a neighborhood where everyone's dying.</v>

532
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they take care of from the back of </v>

533
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.120
<v Speaker 4>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They move it to the top of your head and</v>

534
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 4>then all of its neighbors just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>wilt.</v>

535
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.910
<v Speaker 4>Cowan has the exact same thing he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about on the podcast and he was </v>

536
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.050
<v Speaker 4>saying that they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can pretty much get rid of a lot of</v>

537
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:21.570
<v Speaker 4>the scar nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

538
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.350
<v Speaker 4>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

539
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually having treatments.</v>

540
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:26.200
<v Speaker 4>They shoot things in your scar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes it smaller.</v>

541
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Cortisone or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

542
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:32.100
<v Speaker 4>It is something but it botox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

543
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:37.110
<v Speaker 4>It's not like bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've seen guys who have bad ones </v>

544
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.110
<v Speaker 4>minds really thin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very thin car,</v>

545
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen dudes have big fat wide.</v>

546
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.940
<v Speaker 4>One is skin stretches out some change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that should have like a lot</v>

547
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 4>of bling drag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a giant Jesus on the cross.</v>

548
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a conversation piece.</v>

549
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 4>It'd be nice diamonds and no one will </v>
<v Speaker 4>even know they'll go,</v>

550
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 4>what's going on with your head?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Maybe these colors don't run.</v>

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Did you find it weird that capes never </v>
<v Speaker 4>caught on?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

583
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:27.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted a cape is better than the </v>

584
00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Cape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a more powerful statement.</v>

585
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the host of fear factor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico had a Cape Real.</v>

586
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

587
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 1>When we were doing fear factor there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spun off a bunch of other fear </v>

588
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 1>factors and one of them they did in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

589
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if they fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like official.</v>

590
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:46.450
<v Speaker 1>This really ranked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would copy our ideas and they </v>

591
00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:50.861
<v Speaker 1>would do them with no safety at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we had one where we had these </v>

592
00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>people where they are to get a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a rescue,</v>

593
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:56.651
<v Speaker 1>a dummy out of a burning building and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in these crazy fire suits with </v>

594
00:24:56.651 --> 00:25:00.251
<v Speaker 1>a helmet on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had dude standing by with fire </v>

595
00:25:00.251 --> 00:25:00.470
<v Speaker 1>extinguishers when the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it on the Mexican show.</v>

596
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.570
<v Speaker 1>They wore shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

597
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.470
<v Speaker 1>They were just people in shorts running </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a fucking house.</v>

598
00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:06.400
<v Speaker 1>It was burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

599
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.100
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

600
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous.</v>

601
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 1>It was probably a regular house to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ours is a fake house that the,</v>

602
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:13.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire department uses for training and it</v>

603
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.970
<v Speaker 1>doesn't burn down was covering murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug deal that our country,</v>

604
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:25.121
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our country and our culture is so </v>

605
00:25:25.121 --> 00:25:27.400
<v Speaker 1>engrossed with in lawsuits and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>operates on them and the fear of them </v>

606
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:27.400
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes things way safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about it,</v>

608
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 1>there's countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily Mexico,</v>

609
00:25:31.131 --> 00:25:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's countries in the world were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

610
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 1>that is never an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fall down.</v>

611
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

612
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.280
<v Speaker 1>We want safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to be able to do things safe and</v>

613
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:43.100
<v Speaker 1>we want to be able to sue people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look out for our safety.</v>

614
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:48.550
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately somewhere along the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're becoming a bunch of pussies with </v>

615
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 1>the lawsuit thing is people look at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a lottery.</v>

616
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

617
00:25:53.061 --> 00:25:58.061
<v Speaker 1>there's people that have legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns and legitimate gentleman </v>

618
00:25:58.061 --> 00:25:58.061
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>

619
00:25:58.061 --> 00:25:58.061
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there definitely are.</v>

620
00:25:58.061 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 1>But then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read about just these,</v>

621
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely insane things that you </v>

622
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.750
<v Speaker 1>pin on somebody else for things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

623
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

624
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:12.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the lady that spilled the </v>

625
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:12.821
<v Speaker 1>McDonald's coffee on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

626
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I think the overturn that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overturn that,</v>

627
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and that's not even that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear some of the ones that are,</v>

628
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.800
<v Speaker 1>pick the ones that people win and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts for.</v>

629
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Why are you paying this person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about the Monsanto </v>

630
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.540
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of the guilty of chemical </v>

631
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 1>poisoning people in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they chemically poisoned the French </v>

632
00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 1>farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

633
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.170
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a big suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

635
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 1>they were found guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

636
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:41.951
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact story apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the first such claim to ever reach </v>

638
00:26:41.951 --> 00:26:44.000
<v Speaker 1>French court and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto A.</v>

639
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 4>apparently they have some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>pesticide.</v>

640
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 4>There's another thing they found out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that 93 percent of pregnant women,</v>

641
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they tested,</v>

642
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 4>they found this pesticide that exists in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto.</v>

643
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Genetically modified crops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

644
00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

645
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our politicians sold us down a river.</v>

646
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.610
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they let all this shit go on because </v>

647
00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.110
<v Speaker 4>this is a giant company that makes a ton</v>
<v Speaker 4>of money and the way they make a ton of </v>

648
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.111
<v Speaker 4>money is they patent plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They genetically engineer them so that </v>

649
00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:15.330
<v Speaker 4>it's uniquely theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they can decide where they sell</v>

650
00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:20.331
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They decide what price they have for it </v>

651
00:27:20.331 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 4>and you can't do anything about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to buy new stuff every year and</v>

652
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.820
<v Speaker 4>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it cross pollinates with the </v>

653
00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.681
<v Speaker 4>neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can sue the neighbor for copyright </v>

654
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 4>infringement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely crazy.</v>

655
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 4>They've figured out a way to copyright </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and they've actually tried to do it</v>

656
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 4>with pig parts and Monsanto's crazy.</v>

657
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've tried to do with a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of different shit,</v>

658
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 4>but this should have never been able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to this position.</v>

659
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.140
<v Speaker 4>The this is the best evidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States needs the best evidence.</v>

660
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Something like Monsanto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best evidence that our current </v>

661
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.530
<v Speaker 4>political system is completely corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you were really looking out </v>

662
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.711
<v Speaker 4>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking way you would let a </v>

663
00:27:54.711 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 4>company make a bunch of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take plants,</v>

664
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.810
<v Speaker 4>patent them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then sue people because the [inaudible],</v>

665
00:27:59.010 --> 00:27:59.450
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

666
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 4>the air carries their pollen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cross pollinate neighbors,</v>

667
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:05.280
<v Speaker 4>plants and then this neighbor just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

668
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 4>where the fuck he got that shit from you</v>
<v Speaker 4>assholes.</v>

669
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get to sue them and you're </v>

670
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 4>going to take to court and it was India </v>
<v Speaker 4>in India,</v>

671
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:19.011
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole bang fucking giant group</v>
<v Speaker 4>of farmers that have been killing </v>

672
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:21.250
<v Speaker 4>themselves because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

673
00:28:21.251 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 4>they get indebted to Monsanto and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't afford to pay their bills.</v>

674
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 4>They're Monsanto's like gangsters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's like mine.</v>

675
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>

676
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 4>They will shut you down if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>play ball.</v>

677
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this is crazy because you got to </v>

678
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.001
<v Speaker 4>think about how much political poll that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have and the fact that they still </v>

679
00:28:38.001 --> 00:28:39.010
<v Speaker 4>lost in court that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that says a lot.</v>

680
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are rising up and they're</v>

681
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:46.731
<v Speaker 4>getting tired of this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous what these people have </v>

682
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 4>allowed to take place and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to continue along the same lines.</v>

683
00:28:48.451 --> 00:28:53.451
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we really need is healthy food we </v>

684
00:28:53.451 --> 00:28:56.811
<v Speaker 4>don't need is a bunch of fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit where companies come along and </v>

685
00:28:56.811 --> 00:29:00.000
<v Speaker 4>genetically modified crops and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>take those crops and then they sell them</v>

686
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:05.001
<v Speaker 4>to people with no evidence whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the longterm implications of this,</v>

687
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.370
<v Speaker 4>the exposure to some of these chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what this.</v>

688
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.100
<v Speaker 4>What is this going to do to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment you're playing with God,</v>

698
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 4>but there's not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

699
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Speaker 4>There's not that much evidence like it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

700
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 4>or they're not that much of a history of</v>
<v Speaker 4>genetically modified foods.</v>

701
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean we need like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

702
00:29:32.881 --> 00:29:37.881
<v Speaker 4>30 years to really analyze what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>does the environment people and what's </v>

703
00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:38.960
<v Speaker 4>the chain reaction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's,</v>

704
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.980
<v Speaker 4>what does the wings of the butterfly do </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the modified food to how's it </v>

705
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.940
<v Speaker 4>affect the ecosystem that it all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden it,</v>

706
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 4>it takes over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

707
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird man.</v>

708
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 4>It's weird when you start fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

709
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to this dude was talking about,</v>

710
00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.420
<v Speaker 4>I was just listening to the opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anthony showing what's his face was on </v>

711
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Nicholas cage and he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the black rhinos going extinct this year</v>

712
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.670
<v Speaker 4>and I was telling us do this and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

713
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 4>well we could just bring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

714
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 4>if we were just fucking bring back the </v>
<v Speaker 4>black rhino.</v>

715
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean like you can't,</v>

716
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:13.520

<v Speaker 4>Can't they do that?</v>

717
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 4>They're talking about doing that right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now with Willie Mamis.</v>

718
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then it becomes the question of,</v>

719
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:20.600
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do we need rhinos though,</v>

720
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:27.490

<v Speaker 4>Did you see there's a video in Siberia </v>

722
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 4>of a bear walking across a stream with </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficient his mouth and they.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's a woolly mammoth in Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then other people are going or a </v>

725
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:43.831
<v Speaker 4>bear with efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can the woolly mammoth has a blue </v>

728
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole industry devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>falsely seeing stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 4>earpiece and I would send them out to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place and the cameras were already in </v>

741
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:22.290
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

<v Speaker 4>talking.</v>

764
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

769
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:28.261
<v Speaker 4>poisoned like pop culture and by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of Ufo so they can just recall </v>

770
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 4>because they just have this like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember what happened in that movie I</v>

<v Speaker 4>Or there was lights and lights are </v>

774
00:32:41.431 --> 00:32:41.431
<v Speaker 4>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've</v>

775
00:32:41.431 --> 00:32:41.431
<v Speaker 1>seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it 100 times.</v>

776
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

777
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>they just lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lied.</v>

778
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Not only did they lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lied and were willing to sign a </v>

779
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 1>waiver saying that they lied and that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to show it on TV.</v>

780
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nuts.</v>

781
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.600
<v Speaker 1>People love those shit about stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they love to be the one to </v>

782
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 1>report everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fascination with like,</v>

783
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.990
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

784
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and you get the report and then every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody focuses on you and </v>

785
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.000
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

786
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're willing to give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goods,</v>

787
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 1>people are willing to listen and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>

788
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a charge out of out of being the</v>

789
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:19.211
<v Speaker 1>one that told everybody they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody like it's amazing that they're </v>

790
00:33:19.211 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 1>willing to just make it up just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

791
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 1>for that feeling.</v>

792
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that lived lives</v>

793
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 1>of such shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their lives suck so bad that they almost</v>

794
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:34.271
<v Speaker 1>believe what they're saying when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you some story about seeing </v>

795
00:33:34.271 --> 00:33:34.271
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

796
00:33:34.271 --> 00:33:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a bear and it was 20 </v>

797
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>years ago and they were scared and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dusk and it was like more.</v>

798
00:33:39.941 --> 00:33:44.941
<v Speaker 1>If he made eye contact with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you this right now to the day </v>

799
00:33:44.941 --> 00:33:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear on my,</v>

800
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:51.210
<v Speaker 1>the eyes of my children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a sasquatch and they fucking </v>

801
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:51.220
<v Speaker 1>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

802
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 1>By the time 20 years have passed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've added all kinds of shit.</v>

803
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That member even told him.</v>

804
00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your memories that you have </v>

805
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 1>from like anything more than like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

806
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.380
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that really?</v>

807
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you really mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might remember some really intense shit.</v>

808
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely.</v>

809
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

810
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 1>but barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

811
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:15.251
<v Speaker 1>you could recall data and information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how much of that memory can you </v>

812
00:34:15.251 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 1>really pull out?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like the coolest thing ever.</v>

828
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And she went to touch her left ear and </v>

829
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:00.530

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened is real.</v>

834
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Like one day I was just like telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

835
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:12.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound right.</v>

836
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

837
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:17.861
<v Speaker 1>I think I made this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you forgot what I made it up </v>

838
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.140
<v Speaker 1>because I made it up for that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>

839
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first discovered the feeling,</v>

840
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 1>even 10 years old and you tell someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>some wild shit and they'd go,</v>

841
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

842
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.240

<v Speaker 1>that feels kind of good.</v>

843
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And so like it was like a 10 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that that I told when I was </v>

844
00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

845
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I'm like 14,</v>

846
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.270
<v Speaker 4>15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

847
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I saw this ad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I was 10 years old and I told </v>

848
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.131
<v Speaker 4>you that my teacher's ears fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's what happened with </v>

856
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.760
<v Speaker 4>that's almost unparalleled when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really think about it to be a heisman </v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make people go somewhere.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the beginning and the way he did it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>by posing a bunch of questions.</v>

1023
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:12.220
<v Speaker 4>What if this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if that would've been the way he </v>

1040
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.081
<v Speaker 4>governed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if the two party system was </v>

<v Speaker 4>actually a mechanism used to live at so </v>
<v Speaker 4>called public opinion?</v>

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.410
<v Speaker 4>What if that were more than two sides to</v>
<v Speaker 4>every issue,</v>

1043
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 4>but the two parties wanted to box you </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a corner,</v>

1044
00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:02.470
<v Speaker 4>one of their corners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if there's no such thing as public </v>

1045
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.090
<v Speaker 4>opinion because every thinking person </v>
<v Speaker 4>has opinions that are uniquely his own,</v>

1046
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.420
<v Speaker 4>what have what we call public opinion </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just a manufactured narrative that </v>

1047
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 4>makes it easier to convince people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if their views are different,</v>

1048
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 4>that there's something wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>or there's something wrong with them.</v>

1049
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:22.390
<v Speaker 4>What if the whole purpose of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Democratic and Republican parties was </v>

1050
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 4>not to expand voters choices but to </v>
<v Speaker 4>limit them?</v>

1051
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.560
<v Speaker 4>What if the widely perceived differences</v>
<v Speaker 4>between the two parties was just an </v>

1052
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.951
<v Speaker 4>illusion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if the heart of the government </v>

1053
00:44:32.951 --> 00:44:32.951
<v Speaker 4>policy the same</v>

1054
00:44:32.951 --> 00:44:37.280
<v Speaker 6>no matter who's in the White House?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if the heart of government policy </v>

1055
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 6>remains the same?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No matter what the people want?</v>

1056
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 6>What if those vaunted differences </v>
<v Speaker 6>between Democrat and Republican?</v>

1057
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 6>We're actually just minor disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if both parties just want power and</v>

1058
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:52.551
<v Speaker 6>are willing to have young people fight </v>
<v Speaker 6>meaningless wars in order to enhance </v>

1059
00:44:52.551 --> 00:44:56.331
<v Speaker 6>that power?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if both parties continue to fight </v>

1060
00:44:56.331 --> 00:44:59.061
<v Speaker 6>the war on drugs just to give </v>
<v Speaker 6>bureaucrats on cops bigger budgets and </v>

1061
00:44:59.061 --> 00:45:03.891
<v Speaker 6>more jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What have government policies didn't </v>

1062
00:45:03.891 --> 00:45:06.660
<v Speaker 6>change when government leaders did?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if no matter who won an election,</v>

1063
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:12.020
<v Speaker 6>government stayed the same?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if government was really a </v>

1064
00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.111
<v Speaker 6>revolving door for political hacks?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then and exploiting the people once </v>

1065
00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 6>they're in charge of both parties </v>
<v Speaker 6>supported welfare,</v>

1066
00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:19.120
<v Speaker 6>war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>death,</v>

1067
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.260
<v Speaker 6>they allowed some big government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if the rhetoric they candidates </v>

1068
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.400
<v Speaker 6>displayed on the campaign trail was </v>
<v Speaker 6>jumped after electoral victory?</v>

1069
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:31.930
<v Speaker 6>What if Barack Obama campaign as an </v>
<v Speaker 6>antiwar pro civil liberties candidate </v>

1070
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:36.860
<v Speaker 6>and then wage senseless wars while </v>
<v Speaker 6>assaulting your rights that the </v>

1071
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.401
<v Speaker 6>constitution is supposed to protect?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if George W dot Bush campaign on a </v>

1072
00:45:40.401 --> 00:45:44.721
<v Speaker 6>platform of non intervention and small </v>
<v Speaker 6>government and then wage they foreign </v>

1073
00:45:44.721 --> 00:45:48.540
<v Speaker 6>policy of muscular military intervention</v>
<v Speaker 6>and a domestic policy,</v>

1074
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:53.541
<v Speaker 6>a vast government borrowing and growth?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if Bill Clinton declared that the </v>

1075
00:45:53.541 --> 00:45:58.041
<v Speaker 6>era of big government was over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but actually just convince Republicans </v>

1076
00:45:58.041 --> 00:46:02.691
<v Speaker 6>like Newt Gingrich,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they can get what they want at a </v>

1077
00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 6>big government to what if the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Republicans went along with it?</v>

1078
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.130
<v Speaker 6>What if Ronald Reagan spent six years </v>
<v Speaker 6>running for president,</v>

1079
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:13.370
<v Speaker 6>promising to shrink the government,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then the government grew while he </v>

1080
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:17.061
<v Speaker 6>was in the lighthouse?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if not withstanding Reagan's ideas </v>

1081
00:46:17.061 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 6>and cheerfulness and libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 6>rhetoric,</v>

1082
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 6>there really was no Reagan revolution at</v>
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>

1083
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.550
<v Speaker 6>What if all this is happening again?</v>

1084
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.980
<v Speaker 6>What if Rick Santorum is being embraced </v>
<v Speaker 6>by voters who want small government even</v>

1085
00:46:28.981 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 6>though Senator Santorum voted for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Patriot Act for an expansion of Medicare</v>

1086
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 6>and for raising the debt ceiling by </v>
<v Speaker 6>trillions of dollars?</v>

1087
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:40.350
<v Speaker 6>What if Mitt Romney is being embraced by</v>
<v Speaker 6>voters who want anyone but Barack Obama,</v>

1088
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 6>but they don't realize that Mitt Romney </v>
<v Speaker 6>might as well be Barack Obama on </v>

1089
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:49.491
<v Speaker 6>everything from warfare to welfare?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if Ron Paul is being ignored by the</v>

1090
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:54.621
<v Speaker 6>media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not because as it claims he's </v>

1091
00:46:54.621 --> 00:46:57.230
<v Speaker 6>unappealing or unelectable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but because he doesn't fit into the </v>

1092
00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.101
<v Speaker 6>premanufactured public opinion mold used</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the establishment to pigeon hole the </v>

1093
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:06.621
<v Speaker 6>electorate and create the so called </v>
<v Speaker 6>narrative that drives media coverage of </v>

1094
00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:10.821
<v Speaker 6>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if the biggest difference between </v>

1095
00:47:10.821 --> 00:47:11.490
<v Speaker 6>most candidates was not substance but </v>
<v Speaker 6>style?</v>

1096
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.520
<v Speaker 6>What if those stylistic differences were</v>
<v Speaker 6>packaged,</v>

1097
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:19.521
<v Speaker 6>the substantive ones to reinforce the </v>
<v Speaker 6>illusion of a difference between </v>

1098
00:47:19.521 --> 00:47:23.631
<v Speaker 6>Democrats and Republicans would've met </v>
<v Speaker 6>won Mitt Romney wins and ends up </v>

1099
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 6>continuing most of the same policies </v>
<v Speaker 6>that Barack Obama promoted.</v>

1100
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.990
<v Speaker 6>What if Barack Obama's to or merely </v>
<v Speaker 6>extensions of those from George W dot </v>

1101
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 6>Bush?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if a government that manipulated us</v>

1102
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.950
<v Speaker 6>could be fired?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if a government that lacked the </v>

1103
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 6>true and knowing consent of the governed</v>
<v Speaker 6>could be dismissed?</v>

1104
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.160
<v Speaker 6>Now he's getting crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if it were possible to have a real </v>

1105
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.800
<v Speaker 6>game changer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if we need a Ron Pole to preserve </v>

1106
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.640
<v Speaker 6>and protect our freedoms from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>government?</v>

1107
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:56.641
<v Speaker 6>That's what he got fired for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if we can make elections matter </v>

1108
00:47:56.641 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 6>again?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if we could do something about this</v>

1109
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 6>from the arc defending freedom every </v>
<v Speaker 6>night of the week.</v>

1110
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.680
<v Speaker 4>So depressing that we're really in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where this is the situation </v>

1111
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 4>now where we're really stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're really,</v>

1112
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:11.590
<v Speaker 4>this is where we're at 2012 is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is absolutely right.</v>

1113
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that was his final </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadcast,</v>

1114
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:17.610
<v Speaker 4>but it was a very powerful one and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is powerful stuff.</v>

1115
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.740
<v Speaker 4>The other one that he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he makes connections on nine slash 11 </v>

1116
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 4>with Israeli.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how it's like,</v>

1117
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.280
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird to actually watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was their reason?</v>

1118
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 4>What did they announce was the reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>for firing him?</v>

1119
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:32.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1120
00:48:32.661 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1121
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:38.281
<v Speaker 4>the look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people get fired for all sorts of </v>

1122
00:48:38.281 --> 00:48:41.521
<v Speaker 4>different things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not necessarily sure that he got </v>

1123
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:41.521
<v Speaker 4>fired because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1124
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:43.800
<v Speaker 4>but that's definitely something he went </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucking.</v>

1125
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Was this guy getting farther out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1126
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:46.780
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1127
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty popular.</v>

1128
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 4>It should be even more popular now with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that he said they're gonna </v>

1129
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.710
<v Speaker 4>they're going to take off on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>

1130
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that video is going to take off the</v>

1131
00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:59.131
<v Speaker 4>Internet already is right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it with the hits on it right </v>

1132
00:48:59.131 --> 00:48:59.330
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Four hundred and $44,000.</v>

1133
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a gang of those is not just that</v>

1134
00:49:02.051 --> 00:49:02.760
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1135
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:07.770
<v Speaker 4>there's a gang of those that are out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there that's not just one person put it </v>

1136
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:07.770
<v Speaker 4>up on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.300
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking powerful shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is absolutely right to.</v>

1138
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean how would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you fire the government though?</v>

1139
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Let's look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1140
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.930
<v Speaker 4>something's going to happen though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something's happening.</v>

1141
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:21.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think governments recognizing it </v>

1142
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:21.960
<v Speaker 4>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1143
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:21.960
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be an adjustment is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be some.</v>

1144
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.040
<v Speaker 4>There has to be because otherwise it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dictatorship.</v>

1145
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a certain point in time when you're </v>

1146
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 4>really not doing the will of the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>at all and you're really are suppressing</v>

1147
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 4>the people and you really are taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>away liberties.</v>

1148
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:34.900
<v Speaker 4>You really trying to turn us into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy dictatorship.</v>

1149
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not much different than that.</v>

1150
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if anybody used this shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>without being cynical after you after </v>

1151
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.811
<v Speaker 4>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after or just after you turn a certain </v>

1152
00:49:45.811 --> 00:49:45.811
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like it's all.</v>

1153
00:49:45.811 --> 00:49:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I really do feel like it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like whoever you vote for,</v>

1154
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 4>that nothing is really going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1155
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.490
<v Speaker 4>No one has ever really like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1156
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 4>you start hearing the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the speeches started coming about,</v>

1157
00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 4>we're tying to change Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even.</v>

1158
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Washington outsider.</v>

1159
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm about to go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna change it up now.</v>

1160
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the always the one where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1161
00:50:04.781 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to happen.</v>

1162
00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 4>Then after a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize it's not gonna happen.</v>

1163
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.990
<v Speaker 4>You've realized they're not telling me </v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>

1164
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 4>If Obama wanted to say some really </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical things,</v>

1165
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:15.160
<v Speaker 4>he could have already said it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1166
00:50:15.161 --> 00:50:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Chris Rock really did this really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating interview recently.</v>

1167
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:21.730
<v Speaker 4>We said that he thinks it'll bomb was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to wait until his second term.</v>

1168
00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Then he's going to do some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1169
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:29.250
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds like you're wishful </v>

1170
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:29.250
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1171
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 4>that sounds to me like are you paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to what he has done?</v>

1172
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Almost irreversible damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That National Defense Authorization Act </v>

1173
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.830
<v Speaker 4>that treats the United States like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield and allows indefinite </v>

1174
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 4>suspension or detention of American </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilians with no warrant.</v>

1175
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 4>That's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need that.</v>

1176
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:48.710
<v Speaker 4>We're not falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have violence in the streets </v>

1177
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.951
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not in the middle of an Arab </v>

1178
00:50:50.951 --> 00:50:52.391
<v Speaker 4>spring situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have nuclear bombs dropping on </v>

1179
00:50:52.391 --> 00:50:52.391
<v Speaker 4>our city.</v>

1180
00:50:52.391 --> 00:50:55.510
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instigating or pushing forward those </v>

1181
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 4>kinds of laws and legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number one thing that we're supposed</v>

1182
00:50:57.741 --> 00:51:02.741
<v Speaker 4>to be about is the pursuit of liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be liberty and justice </v>

1183
00:51:02.741 --> 00:51:02.741
<v Speaker 4>for all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how.</v>

1184
00:51:02.741 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 4>That's how it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1185
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 4>With liberty and justice for all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we want.</v>

1186
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.260
<v Speaker 4>And you're taking away liberty for what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>For what are you giving us extra </v>

1187
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 4>justice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that why,</v>

1188
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bullshit is what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's 100 percent bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not representative of the people.</v>

1190
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:21.060
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sad and it's got change.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1192

1381
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:48.010
<v Speaker 1>chest and your back and then how long </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it take you to die from cigarettes?</v>

1382
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1383
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:54.330
<v Speaker 1>It really matters if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you have cancer in your </v>

1384
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:57.390
<v Speaker 1>family and I don't have cancer and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are genetically just don't get </v>

1385
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.390
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

1386
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely stories,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1388
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1389
00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:04.690
<v Speaker 1>A friend's grandparents who lived into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nineties and smoked and drank and </v>

1390
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 1>ate red meat and low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just died.</v>

1391
00:59:05.891 --> 00:59:07.540
<v Speaker 1>They didn't die of cancer into that old </v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

1392
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a good time smiling.</v>

1393
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't been drinking.</v>

1394
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:15.340
<v Speaker 1>There were some things that I read once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's documented,</v>

1395
00:59:15.341 --> 00:59:18.550
<v Speaker 1>but that 100 percent of all people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>live to be over 100 eat red meat.</v>

1396
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a documented of a </v>

1397
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:24.300
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian</v>

1398
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 4>lives to be over a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be total horse shit.</v>

1399
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Don't fucking crazy.</v>

1411
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:57.400
<v Speaker 4>I have a Kale Salad a few times a week </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a place where it's hard to get </v>

<v Speaker 4>grass fed meat these days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1413
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Apparently all of it's getting consumed </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in northern California.</v>

1414
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 4>All the hippies up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

1415
01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 4>It's all natural meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1416
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 4>It's way better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just go to whole foods.</v>

1417
01:00:08.511 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 4>They don't have it.</v>

1418
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:14.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're out of it a lot because ups up </v>

1419
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:14.110
<v Speaker 4>north.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1420
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 4>there's only a certain amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are grown,</v>

1421
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:17.480
<v Speaker 4>grass fed meat and it's become super </v>
<v Speaker 4>popular lately.</v>

1422
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.490
<v Speaker 4>So all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1423
01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 4>it's more popular in Berkeley and San </v>
<v Speaker 4>Francisco I'm sure.</v>

1424
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:26.890
<v Speaker 4>Then down here and retard advil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they uh,</v>

1425
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 4>they can sell all of their cows up </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1426
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Why ship them all the way down to Los </v>
<v Speaker 4>Angeles.</v>

1427
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 4>So they're having an issue like last </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tuesday though,</v>

1428
01:00:33.321 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 4>the whole foods near me didn't even get </v>
<v Speaker 4>a shipment of grass fed meat.</v>

1429
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.340
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 4>I have to go there on Tuesday to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat.</v>

1431
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only time they taste the </v>

1432
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Speaker 4>difference like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

1433
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different meat.</v>

1434
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different animal because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cow that is raised on corn,</v>

1435
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.350
<v Speaker 4>they're fat fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're.</v>

1436
01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.490
<v Speaker 4>They're marbled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's really delicious.</v>

1437
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really fucking yummy because all that </v>

1438
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.731
<v Speaker 4>fat gets all like a Ribeye from a corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A corn raised cow is great because it's </v>

1439
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:06.221
<v Speaker 4>so juicy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not quite as healthy for you </v>

1440
01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:07.430
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't taste the same when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a grass fed rib eye,</v>

1441
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:12.490
<v Speaker 4>there's much less marbling and you got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to cook it quicker because it'll dry </v>

1442
01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:12.980
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's much less fat in it.</v>

1443
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:16.120
<v Speaker 4>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of Syria to get better.</v>

1444
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 4>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good though.</v>

1445
01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.570
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally different.</v>

1446
01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:23.070
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a game he animal not </v>
<v Speaker 4>gain me.</v>

1447
01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:23.830
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1448
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.200
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1449
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:27.470
<v Speaker 4>it tastes like buffalo or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost.</v>

1450
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tastes better.</v>

1451
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.100
<v Speaker 4>It tastes like you're eating a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

1452
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1453
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some steaks I've had where I'm</v>

1454
01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:34.450
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

1455
01:01:34.451 --> 01:01:36.700
<v Speaker 4>like you can fill your body kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>slowing down.</v>

1456
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:43.780
<v Speaker 4>That was not grass fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those supposed to be way healthier for </v>

1457
01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.900
<v Speaker 4>you to something about the actual animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>being healthy.</v>

1458
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 4>That like a lot of guys I know a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters have switched to grass fed meat</v>

1459
01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

1460
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:50.590
<v Speaker 4>my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1461
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.060

1462
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.360
<v Speaker 4>said his performance really started </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasing when he upped his greens and </v>

1463
01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.870
<v Speaker 4>unchanged to all grass fed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1465
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just healthier,</v>

1466
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just makes sense that your body would</v>

1467
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 4>respond better if you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthier animals.</v>

1468
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:09.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does make sense for fucking up man.</v>

1469
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Fucking eat your veggies and fruits.</v>

<v Speaker 4>man fat fuck cows and farm grown fish </v>

1471
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:22.150
<v Speaker 4>because all the fish in the ocean or Dan</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1472
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:27.170
<v Speaker 4>they said that the next hundred years is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be the last wild fish in the </v>

1473
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.540
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1474
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Within the next hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There will be no more wild fish in the </v>

1475
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.170
<v Speaker 4>oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we'll.</v>

1476
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.300
<v Speaker 4>We'll have out fish the entire region.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One company also say that.</v>

1477
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think about it from an exponential </v>

1478
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 4>growth point of view that there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 4>more people in 100 years.</v>

1479
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:42.570
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1480
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.600
<v Speaker 4>think about 100 years ago there was only</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a billion people on the planet and </v>

1481
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 4>how there are 7 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's crazy.</v>

1482
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.440
<v Speaker 4>What's it going to be 100 years from </v>
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>

1483
01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:54.441
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be 30 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are they going to get all their </v>

1484
01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:54.441
<v Speaker 4>protein from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it's going to be finished.</v>

1485
01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:54.500
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to catch and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

1486
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Once they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know they're gonna,</v>

1487
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.450
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna fucking just troll </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1488
01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.720
<v Speaker 4>They suck all that fucking fish out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1489
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.020
<v Speaker 4>They're going to eat whales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to do everything they can </v>

1490
01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.770
<v Speaker 4>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to see everything that </v>

1491
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.441
<v Speaker 4>humans can consume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then 100 years now we're going to </v>

1492
01:03:09.441 --> 01:03:09.441
<v Speaker 4>have to figure it out.</v>

1493
01:03:09.441 --> 01:03:09.900
<v Speaker 4>It would just be an empty ocean because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be crazy.</v>

1494
01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:14.901
<v Speaker 4>That would be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if we actually kill </v>

1495
01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:17.331
<v Speaker 4>everything in the ocean within a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand years if people lived to be </v>

1496
01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:21.460
<v Speaker 4>1000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that outside the realm of </v>

1497
01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:21.460
<v Speaker 4>possibility?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1498
01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.410
<v Speaker 4>It was something I tweeted earlier today</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the garbage patch.</v>

1499
01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Some lady went to the garbage patches in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</v>

1500
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.720
<v Speaker 4>For folks who don't know bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas,</v>

1501
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant hunk of garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All plastic that's Kinda caught together</v>

1502
01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 4>in this one swarm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like caught up,</v>

1503
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:39.270
<v Speaker 4>I guess in like the way the tides go is </v>
<v Speaker 4>one area where it's collected where it's</v>

1504
01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:41.370
<v Speaker 4>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bigger than the state of Texas,</v>

1505
01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:43.770
<v Speaker 4>which takes like more than a data drive </v>
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

1506
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.980
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's how much garbage is out there </v>

1507
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:49.650
<v Speaker 4>and it's just getting bigger and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna keep getting bigger forever.</v>

1508
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 4>Is that a homeless person's heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think?</v>

1509
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:56.661
<v Speaker 4>They all talk about it as if it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Disney road never had to pick.</v>

1510
01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 4>I think the plastic breaks down though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's part of the issue is that</v>

1511
01:04:02.641 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 4>the salt water breaks it down for like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jelly,</v>

1512
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:08.130
<v Speaker 4>like little particles and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked.</v>

1513
01:04:08.131 --> 01:04:09.790
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like stuff floating.</v>

1514
01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:12.450
<v Speaker 4>Then you can scoop up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Becomes like almost liquid.</v>

1515
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up man.</v>

1516
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:20.020
<v Speaker 4>We're so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about what we do we kill </v>

1517
01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.170
<v Speaker 4>all the rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We fucked the ocean over.</v>

1518
01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:24.810
<v Speaker 4>We eat all the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We throw our garbage in it.</v>

1519
01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.670
<v Speaker 4>You would drive by um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trash.</v>

1520
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.140
<v Speaker 4>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trash plants.</v>

1521
01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:28.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to you.</v>

1522
01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:29.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1523
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Landfills.</v>

1524
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Landfills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1525
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 4>And you see how like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1526
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:37.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a higher altitude than like the </v>

1527
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:37.990
<v Speaker 4>street level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1528
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:41.600
<v Speaker 4>that's just going to keep growing like </v>
<v Speaker 4>one day that's going to be like a </v>

1529
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:41.600
<v Speaker 4>building of God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1530
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hills.</v>

1531
01:04:42.641 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 4>The Stan hope and I filmed the finale of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the man show in a garbage dump.</v>

1532
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Because the girls were trying to con us </v>
<v Speaker 4>into taking them to an island.</v>

1534
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.230
<v Speaker 4>There was two of the girls that were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the old man show and we didn't get along</v>

1535
01:04:55.231 --> 01:05:00.231
<v Speaker 4>with them so well and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adam and Jimmy used to take us to the </v>

1536
01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:00.231
<v Speaker 4>Bahamas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should do that.</v>

1537
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.430
<v Speaker 4>You should take it to the Bahamas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll film the final scene there.</v>

1538
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 4>And then we thought about it and doug </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I were like,</v>

1539
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:07.530
<v Speaker 4>we should do it at a garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1540
01:05:07.531 --> 01:05:08.310
<v Speaker 4>we think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1541
01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to do it in a garbage dump in </v>
<v Speaker 4>New Jersey.</v>

1542
01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to do it like the stinkiness </v>
<v Speaker 4>grossest dump.</v>

1543
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.040
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1544
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 4>if you're at home and you're watching a </v>
<v Speaker 4>series,</v>

1545
01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 4>two assholes hanging out with girls who </v>
<v Speaker 4>never fuck you on,</v>

1546
01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a place where you can never afford to</v>

1547
01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:22.270
<v Speaker 4>go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1548
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.020
<v Speaker 4>hanging on the wall.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How is that fun for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go be much more fun for you to watch </v>

1550

<v Speaker 4>us in a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much funnier to.</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1552
01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:31.780

<v Speaker 4>at us.</v>

1553
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:36.040
<v Speaker 4>It was gross and their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really funny that they ask for it</v>

1554
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First they were like,</v>

1555
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:38.230
<v Speaker 4>what's up with the Bahamas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they wanted to go garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1558
01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:43.110
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't blame a man that culture,</v>

1559
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.540
<v Speaker 4>the hot chip culture of asking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and then they would like,</v>

1560
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:51.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rub the writers shoulders and you're </v>

1561
01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:51.541
<v Speaker 4>going to put us in a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1562
01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:52.980
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gross shit though.</v>

1563
01:05:52.981 --> 01:05:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1564
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.980
<v Speaker 4>so that was the culture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of growth going on,</v>

1565
01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:00.650
<v Speaker 4>but sure not none of those as groceries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That garbage dump Netapp for all of it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>garbage dust floating in the air and it </v>

<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sucks.</v>

1599
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.600

<v Speaker 4>It's totally true.</v>

1603
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:29.280
<v Speaker 4>We should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should seriously look into a good </v>

1604
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.610
<v Speaker 4>place where we can all move here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just everybody outside of La,</v>

1605
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.770

01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:41.630
<v Speaker 4>tom and I met a long time ago when I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the maximum tour with Charlie </v>

1700
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:45.230
<v Speaker 4>Murphy and John [inaudible] and what we </v>
<v Speaker 4>do is we go to these different places </v>

1701
01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:45.720
<v Speaker 4>and they would have like a local guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>opened up for us.</v>

1702
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.760
<v Speaker 4>Everyone that opened up for us was </v>
<v Speaker 4>really funny.</v>

1703
01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:52.761
<v Speaker 4>It was really good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like local talent because it was the </v>

1704
01:11:52.761 --> 01:11:55.131
<v Speaker 4>maximum bud light comedy tour and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>really did a good job of casting the </v>

1705
01:11:55.131 --> 01:11:55.131
<v Speaker 4>local guys.</v>

1706
01:11:55.131 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 4>But when we did Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy wasn't even local.</v>

1707
01:11:57.451 --> 01:11:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Just somehow or another he got involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this.</v>

1708
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:04.730
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was one of those guys where he went </v>

1709
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:04.730
<v Speaker 4>up and I went,</v>

1742
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:33.850

<v Speaker 4>I love Colorado snow and his fuck there </v>

1743
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:33.850
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 degrees here.</v>

1744
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Socket.</v>

1745
01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 4>But snow is awesome when you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go anywhere.</v>

1746
01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Remember those times when you go out </v>
<v Speaker 4>your back porch and you just fucking </v>

1747
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:43.130
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

1748
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:45.810
<v Speaker 4>Knowing the way sound just gets absorbed</v>
<v Speaker 4>and snow.</v>

1749
01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1750
01:13:47.001 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 4>Some great fucking times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still want to live in it.</v>

1751
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:50.970
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do like visiting snow.</v>

1752
01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I like visiting it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to get a house somewhere </v>

1753
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.090
<v Speaker 4>where it's cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1754
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100
<v Speaker 4>where I could visit on occasion and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1755
01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.960
<v Speaker 4>I just have to get some more baller </v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

1756
01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.990
<v Speaker 4>but now I'm fucked because it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear factor is going to fucking bite it.</v>

1757
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:06.020
<v Speaker 4>What it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was like some of the best </v>

1758
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:09.230
<v Speaker 4>ratings ratings dropped that much down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1759
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think some of the,</v>

1760
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 4>one of the issues is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest,</v>

1761
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:18.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a bit low brow and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>NBC is trying to have quality </v>

1762
01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:20.100
<v Speaker 4>programming like the author uses </v>
<v Speaker 4>serious.</v>

1763
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1764
01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:22.910
<v Speaker 4>I think there's issue number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't,</v>

1765
01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:28.170
<v Speaker 4>they haven't decided yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it looked they've got </v>

1766
01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:28.170
<v Speaker 4>appointment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1767
01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:28.170
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1768
01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:28.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hayden,</v>

1769
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.600
<v Speaker 4>I love doing it just because I love the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys that I work with.</v>

1770
01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:35.440
<v Speaker 4>I Love David Horwitz and Matt </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] units and Rupert and all the</v>

1771
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 4>people that all will be Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The director,</v>

1772
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.930
<v Speaker 4>the other people that I've worked with </v>
<v Speaker 4>were really fucking awesome people.</v>

1773
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 4>They're really fun to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a family and I miss them,</v>

1774
01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:49.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the five years that I didn't work with </v>

1775
01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:49.380
<v Speaker 4>them and then I'm working with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>again for this short season.</v>

1776
01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 4>It was really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not my favorite thing to do.</v>

1777
01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing it for a long time.</v>

1778
01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:55.450
<v Speaker 4>I know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know how to host a game show,</v>

1779
01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 4>but I prefer doing stand up and work out</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the UFC and this.</v>

1780
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:01.990
<v Speaker 4>They should move that show to hbo had </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed it.</v>

1781
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Like you're eating fucking fish from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Janice and I think it's over.</v>

1782
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.200
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing was like,</v>

1783
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.140
<v Speaker 4>I was telling them that the donkey loads</v>
<v Speaker 4>were too much.</v>

1784
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't do this.</v>

1785
01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.680
<v Speaker 4>We can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like BC approved it.</v>

1786
01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 4>He approved it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because they approved it doesn't </v>

1787
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:19.960
<v Speaker 4>mean you should be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like seriously?</v>

1788
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.960
<v Speaker 4>You could see that when I'm the voice of</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason when I'm the one who's telling </v>

1789
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.790
<v Speaker 4>you we're going too far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1790
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is happening here?</v>

1791
01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.960
<v Speaker 4>It's just they got a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want her to have an awesome show?</v>

1792
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>

1793
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:35.500
<v Speaker 4>it was a fun thing while it lasted and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly believe that these new episodes</v>

1794
01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:37.360
<v Speaker 4>were better than any of the ones we ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>did before.</v>

1795
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.300
<v Speaker 4>I haven't enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see anything wrong with it and I</v>

1796
01:15:40.301 --> 01:15:42.130
<v Speaker 4>think it's silly that NBC went and did </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because they,</v>

1797
01:15:42.131 --> 01:15:44.260
<v Speaker 4>all their other shows are hurting bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They suck.</v>

1798
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:47.510
<v Speaker 4>That Whitney show just got horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>reviews or ratings.</v>

1799
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.180
<v Speaker 4>I watched it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was not good,</v>

1800
01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.130
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>

1801
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.350
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do a good sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do it right.</v>

1802
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:54.890
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard she's a funny standup.</v>

1803
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:59.910
<v Speaker 4>I never seen her perform before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I heard that Chris Lee is a funny </v>

1804
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.000
<v Speaker 4>comic as well and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's buddies with Brian.</v>

1805
01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:02.210
<v Speaker 4>I never seen him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's funny as well,</v>

1806
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:07.350
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it that they can have to really </v>

1807
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.541
<v Speaker 4>funny people and not have a funny show?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times there's just too many </v>

1808
01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:12.751
<v Speaker 4>cooks in the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times they're trying to </v>

1809
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:12.751
<v Speaker 4>accomplish something and trying to get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>vibe going.</v>

1810
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:14.170
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to find their footing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They believe in it though,</v>

1811
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.230
<v Speaker 4>because they renewed it for another </v>
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>

1812
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1813
01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:19.120
<v Speaker 4>they're both funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are funny people.</v>

1814
01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.390
<v Speaker 4>You take some wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1815
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I really enjoyed my time on news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got a real deep respect for the </v>

1816
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.080
<v Speaker 4>craft of creating a television show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1817
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:30.160
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 4>never did it again.</v>

1818
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:31.790
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why I never get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1819
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1820
01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:37.381
<v Speaker 4>I knew that the guys that I was working </v>
<v Speaker 4>with were incredibly talented and it's </v>

1821
01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:37.381
<v Speaker 4>such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Simms,</v>

1822
01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:41.881
<v Speaker 4>the executive producer was such an </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and intelligent guy and his </v>

1823
01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 4>sensibilities were so out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew that after like working with him,</v>

1824
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:47.230
<v Speaker 4>it was going to be really hard to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>another sort of Sitcom,</v>

1825
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.110
<v Speaker 4>a real mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if it's a successful one,</v>

1826
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to do crap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1827
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.490
<v Speaker 4>you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1828
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.280
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1829
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 4>how much writing is everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1830
01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:58.720
<v Speaker 4>It's every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see these shows that are so good and</v>

1831
01:16:58.721 --> 01:16:59.860
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

1832
01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:03.760
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say it's everything because </v>
<v Speaker 4>good writing was shit delivery and shit,</v>

1833
01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comics and shit.</v>

1834
01:17:05.261 --> 01:17:10.261
<v Speaker 4>Actors is not good either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a huge part of the problem and </v>

1835
01:17:10.261 --> 01:17:12.260
<v Speaker 4>part of the equation Rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you need real eccentrics to,</v>

1836
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:17.290
<v Speaker 4>to running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that these guys were </v>

1837
01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:17.290
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of them were still.</v>

1838
01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:17.290
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple of them that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>standups,</v>

1839
01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're on the staff,</v>

1840
01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.260
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part they were just </v>
<v Speaker 4>really bright,</v>

1841
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:24.890
<v Speaker 4>silly guys who knew how to put together </v>
<v Speaker 4>something funny.</v>

1842
01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:29.940
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The for every matt stone and Trey </v>

1843
01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Parker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's 100 pretenders,</v>

1844
01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:35.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least for at least one anymore and </v>

1845
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:35.820
<v Speaker 4>you can get caught on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitcoms where you just like,</v>

1846
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 4>you're reading the script and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

1847
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those intangibles to like a show airs </v>

1848
01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.440
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes it just gets legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peanut were drawn to it,</v>

1849
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:50.470
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes you'll feel like </v>

1850
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.470
<v Speaker 4>everything's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we got the scripts are great.</v>

1851
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:51.650
<v Speaker 4>We've got great actors every now and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1852
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.450
<v Speaker 4>people don't respond to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1853
01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.310
<v Speaker 4>That's Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1854
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of times it's who's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>production company and what kind of pull</v>

1855
01:17:57.581 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 4>they have with the network where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>decide to put the show,</v>

1856
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:02.900
<v Speaker 4>but I w I would definitely do another </v>
<v Speaker 4>acting gig.</v>

1857
01:18:02.901 --> 01:18:05.420
<v Speaker 4>I really enjoyed doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A movie with Kevin James,</v>

1858
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 4>the zookeeper movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a lot of fun,</v>

1859
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.250
<v Speaker 4>but it was mostly fun because Kevin and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I have been friends since we were really</v>

1860
01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:13.250
<v Speaker 4>young and to to do a movement even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though it was a silly kids movie.</v>

1861
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:13.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was fun.</v>

1862
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to act.</v>

1863
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:20.020
<v Speaker 4>It was fun to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the thing with Leslie Bibb and </v>

1864
01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.371
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the chick from Talladega </v>

1865
01:18:22.371 --> 01:18:22.371
<v Speaker 4>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1866
01:18:22.371 --> 01:18:22.371
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm acting with the girlfriend Talladega</v>

1867
01:18:22.371 --> 01:18:26.950
<v Speaker 4>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't done any acting in fucking 10 </v>

1868
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.950
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was weird.</v>

1869
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:31.060
<v Speaker 4>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would totally do something like that </v>

1870
01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:31.060
<v Speaker 4>was totally do a sitcom or something fun</v>
<v Speaker 4>act again,</v>

1871
01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.590
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the weirdest things about being a</v>

1872
01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 4>comic is that everybody wants to put you</v>
<v Speaker 4>into some acting situation.</v>

1873
01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Where are you going to do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not nearly as funny as your act?</v>

1874
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:41.750
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can see it.</v>

1876
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Like when you audition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>

1877
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:46.340
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punch it up or you change it,</v>

1878
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:47.880
<v Speaker 4>you'll add something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like,</v>

1879
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 4>that was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1880
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:51.200
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of have to do this a lot.</v>

1881
01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta sometimes stuff up.</v>

1882
01:18:53.781 --> 01:18:56.420
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they get mad and I got yelled </v>
<v Speaker 4>at one time too.</v>

1883
01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.660
<v Speaker 4>Would they say I'm the guy laughed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then we did it.</v>

1884
01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.600
<v Speaker 4>We did it again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was like,</v>

1885
01:19:01.601 --> 01:19:03.410
<v Speaker 4>that's just rude man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1886
01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

1887
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:09.491
<v Speaker 4>that's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he meant it was rude and I tagged </v>

1888
01:19:09.491 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 4>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1889
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.270

<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1890
01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.920
<v Speaker 4>And he laughed the first time and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

1891
01:19:12.921 --> 01:19:14.360
<v Speaker 4>it's really rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to drop that.</v>

1892
01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:15.830
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

1893
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.530
<v Speaker 4>fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fucked me up so badly that we did the</v>

1894
01:19:18.531 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 4>third take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>So it was a weak bitch.</v>

1897

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't a director or the producer on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and the odds of you being in there so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many people out there trying to do it.</v>

1949
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've written a couple.</v>

1950
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever done a couple of scripts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1951
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.220
<v Speaker 4>pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1953
01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:19.300
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is naturally the brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>just pulling your hair out and then you </v>

1954
01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.910
<v Speaker 4>rewrite it so many times in some reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1955
01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:22.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to make some more changes.</v>

1956
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.240
<v Speaker 4>Like I've already written it fucking 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>

1957
01:21:24.241 --> 01:21:25.440
<v Speaker 4>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1958
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.500
<v Speaker 4>they will never let you create your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>shop because if you create your own </v>

1959
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.651
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you own the show and if you own the </v>

1960
01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:33.651
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking billions.</v>

1961
01:21:33.651 --> 01:21:36.740
<v Speaker 4>They have that thing locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only people who can own shows and </v>

1962
01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:39.120
<v Speaker 4>have be show runners and be executive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are already deep,</v>

1963
01:21:39.121 --> 01:21:40.140
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deep in the business.</v>

1964
01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:44.280
<v Speaker 4>There's very little room for some new </v>
<v Speaker 4>new guy who hates his own show.</v>

1965
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they have.</v>

1967
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:50.590

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.280
<v Speaker 9>But that second time he saved our life </v>
<v Speaker 9>actually because we went from his </v>

2289
01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.121
<v Speaker 9>trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The second time he jumped in the back </v>

2290
01:35:49.121 --> 01:35:51.580
<v Speaker 9>went to Avenue d,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is the fucking shitty street in </v>

2291
01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.150
<v Speaker 9>Fort Pierce.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like if you're going to like every city,</v>

2292
01:35:53.151 --> 01:35:58.151
<v Speaker 9>you know you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I dunno whatever city you're in there </v>

2293
01:35:58.151 --> 01:36:00.401
<v Speaker 9>like that's ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you've been to the street where you </v>

2294
01:36:00.401 --> 01:36:02.690
<v Speaker 9>see open drug dealing where there's not </v>
<v Speaker 9>even some type of facade angeles,</v>

2295
01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.720
<v Speaker 9>right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you've been done on a street where </v>

2296
01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:07.720
<v Speaker 9>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's no pretense about it.</v>

2297
01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.340
<v Speaker 9>There's just like Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Which part of filming fear factor?</v>

2298
01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:15.341
<v Speaker 9>We were actually filming the playboy </v>
<v Speaker 9>playmate addition of fear factor </v>

2299
01:36:15.341 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 9>downtown area and we were watching </v>
<v Speaker 9>people sell drugs,</v>

2300
01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:19.360
<v Speaker 9>smoke crack right there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We were in a crane and I go,</v>

2301
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:20.450
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're smoking crack.</v>

2302
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 9>And the girls were like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh my God,</v>

2303
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:22.900
<v Speaker 9>they are smoking crack.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And like,</v>

2304
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:25.250
<v Speaker 9>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 9>No one's protecting us.</v>

2305
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:30.280
<v Speaker 9>We're up here on a crane.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was exactly like this where we </v>

2306
01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 9>pulled up in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in Steve's car and the windows come down</v>

2307
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:37.241
<v Speaker 9>and we just get surrounded.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like the car got surrounded by six guys </v>

2308
01:36:37.241 --> 01:36:40.970
<v Speaker 9>and they reached in their jackets and </v>
<v Speaker 9>they go at this one guy who was.</v>

<v Speaker 9>And I.</v>

2312
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:51.590

<v Speaker 4>when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we used to go to dorchester to eat late </v>

2350
01:38:10.941 --> 01:38:15.200
<v Speaker 4>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hanging out with this one kid I </v>

2351
01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.701
<v Speaker 4>lived in Jamaica plain before I went to </v>
<v Speaker 4>high school in Jamaica plain was like a </v>

2352
01:38:16.701 --> 01:38:19.110
<v Speaker 4>real shifting neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of kind of creepy and it was</v>

2353
01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 4>it board some really creepy places and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>became friends with a couple of those </v>

2354
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:29.001
<v Speaker 4>kids and I stayed in touch with them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then when I went to high school I went </v>

2355
01:38:29.001 --> 01:38:31.821
<v Speaker 4>to visit him a couple times before I </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized it was really fucking </v>

2356
01:38:31.821 --> 01:38:31.821
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:38:31.821 --> 01:38:31.821
<v Speaker 4>they were going to a bad high school </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2358
01:38:31.821 --> 01:38:36.540
<v Speaker 4>They're high highschool situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My host high school situation was very </v>

2359
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.171
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went to the same middle school </v>

2360
01:38:39.171 --> 01:38:39.171
<v Speaker 4>together and middle school was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>okay because kids were young,</v>

2361
01:38:39.171 --> 01:38:41.120
<v Speaker 4>they hadn't gotten into dangerous shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet and you know,</v>

2362
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.710
<v Speaker 4>this is 1980,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2363
01:38:42.711 --> 01:38:47.711
<v Speaker 4>this is early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like when the sugar hill </v>

2364
01:38:47.711 --> 01:38:47.711
<v Speaker 4>gang would just come out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hip hop,</v>

2365
01:38:47.711 --> 01:38:48.720
<v Speaker 4>inhibit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibit of hip hop.</v>

2366
01:38:48.721 --> 01:38:53.721
<v Speaker 4>That was the first rap music and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>very friendly in retrospect and things </v>

2367
01:38:53.721 --> 01:38:57.120
<v Speaker 4>changed radically though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When when I left I went to a Newton,</v>

2368
01:38:57.270 --> 01:39:02.270
<v Speaker 4>which is nice suburbs and I lived across</v>
<v Speaker 4>the street from a river and woods near </v>

2369
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:06.651
<v Speaker 4>me and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they went to the inner city high </v>

2370
01:39:06.651 --> 01:39:07.170
<v Speaker 4>school and they had some fucking tough </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

2371
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched those dudes.</v>

2372
01:39:08.191 --> 01:39:13.050
<v Speaker 4>They were basically involved in just </v>
<v Speaker 4>just crime was everywhere around them.</v>

2373
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:14.370
<v Speaker 4>It was nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2374
01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inner city shit is just no fun at all.</v>

2375
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:22.790
<v Speaker 4>And I got lucky that my parents made a </v>
<v Speaker 4>move to a nicer place and we anyway,</v>

2376
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 4>we would go to these places like late at</v>
<v Speaker 4>night when I was hanging out with them,</v>

2377
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd hang out with some of their friends</v>

2378
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:32.910
<v Speaker 4>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd go to like Dorchester at like 2:00</v>

2379
01:39:32.911 --> 01:39:33.830
<v Speaker 4>in the morning to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2380
01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:38.980

01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:48.591
<v Speaker 4>It was sandwiches and there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>slot where you would slide the food </v>

2385
01:39:48.591 --> 01:39:52.011
<v Speaker 4>under and it was like the worst fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood you could possibly be in </v>

2386
01:39:52.011 --> 01:39:53.390
<v Speaker 4>outside of Beirut.</v>

<v Speaker 4>walk off and he was eating it like right</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the front door,</v>

2392
01:40:08.771 --> 01:40:13.050
<v Speaker 4>like blocking the door like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it got far enough for,</v>

2393
01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:16.910
<v Speaker 4>he was away from danger and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>with no regard for how it looked.</v>

2394
01:40:16.911 --> 01:40:19.020
<v Speaker 4>It was just eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blocking the doorway,</v>

2395
01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:20.920
<v Speaker 4>eating the sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>which was a.</v>

2403
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:45.690
<v Speaker 4>and then the next weekend somebody came </v>

<v Speaker 4>then stabbing themselves.</v>

2406
01:40:51.571 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 4>But it was also God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was also</v>

2407
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.550
<v Speaker 1>like a criminal hangout because at </v>

2409
01:40:58.901 --> 01:41:01.420

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:04.210
<v Speaker 1>people who are up all night could go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang out.</v>
