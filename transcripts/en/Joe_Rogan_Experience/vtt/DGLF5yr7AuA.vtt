<v Speaker 1>You can change government changing government.</v>

47
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago I went to a club to get Quain loot and I walked in,</v>

48
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:22.441
<v Speaker 1>I never forget,</v>

49
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>there's like a,</v>

50
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>it was called Ramrod.</v>

51
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>There was a gay bar in the city.</v>

52
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.191
<v Speaker 1>We were kids.</v>

53
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>We were like 18 and I walked into this club and before we walked in there was a</v>

54
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>fetish club on the side and there was a guy in a tub that had a sign on them</v>

55
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>that said spit on me.</v>

56
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>That was his fetish for people to spit on him.</v>

57
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So here's the beauty.</v>

58
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing there,</v>

59
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>your joy is gone.</v>

61
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.594
<v Speaker 1>You're drinking.</v>

62
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>You know you had a pea and Austin,</v>

63
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>they see 20 guys standing on line for the fucking bathroom,</v>

64
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:46.801
<v Speaker 1>and I asked him,</v>

65
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:46.981
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

66
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

67
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just ask the guy in the Tub if we could pee on?</v>

68
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So I walked over to the guy,</v>

69
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

70
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.243
<v Speaker 1>can I ask you a question?</v>

71
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you mind if we pray on you?</v>

72
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>The guys go right ahead.</v>

73
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>There was a point in the night I looked at him,</v>

74
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>he had a circle of guys just bringing all those guys that don't want to wait on</v>

75
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

76
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.351
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck it,</v>

77
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.184
<v Speaker 1>just piano.</v>

78
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>When I left to go ahead and three inches of p in the fucking dog,</v>

79
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>if the sign was all fucking and melted,</v>

80
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>this guy wanted people to spill out and we ended up pissing on it and I pissed</v>

81
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>down and I'm guilty of,</v>

82
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

83
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>It is decided by Deka,</v>

84
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Latin in North Bergen,</v>

85
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:14.641
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

86
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>These cops got together.</v>

87
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.261
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

88
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm from a real corrupt police town and they call this bar the Meadowlands in</v>

89
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and there was a gogo bond only avenue and on Wednesday night it was erotic</v>

90
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>banana night for two bucks.</v>

91
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>They give you a frozen banana and you walk into the Strip club,</v>

92
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.771
<v Speaker 1>you peel the banana,</v>

93
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.604
<v Speaker 1>you gave it to the chick,</v>

94
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>she shoved in a pussy,</v>

95
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.720

<v Speaker 1>He was always in there.</v>

97
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 1>One year I go in there and I'm sad.</v>

98
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.911
<v Speaker 1>The bottom,</v>

99
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>this is old guy that had like a stage in the middle and then you sit around the</v>

100
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:39.751
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

101
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but the chicks would put their foot and climb over.</v>

102
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how this is 1980 dog.</v>

103
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>This was strictly as you could kill a bitch in a strip club.</v>

104
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.703
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

105
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>In a strip club rod and $50 that was on the menu</v>

106
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>and if 50 get to kill me,</v>

107
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>that would be 60 I'm about 16 I calm my little pussy bow as a professional.</v>

108
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about the dirty things.</v>

109
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I lied.</v>

110
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this mother fucker took his,</v>

111
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>she took his false teeth up and stuck them in a snatch and put them back.</v>

112
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Then he put them in his mouth on Christmas Eve.</v>

113
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I love people who think they're going to be the year with test those fucking</v>

114
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>clowns.</v>

115
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Randleman was awesome.</v>

116
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It was primal.</v>

117
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I love those fucking clowns cause I was with them.</v>

118
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I always thought I was a little bit BB does system.</v>

119
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I used to drink vinegar now I used to do an eight ball on Friday,</v>

120
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>eight ball and Sam and then they would have to test me on Monday for federal</v>

121
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>probation or Wednesday or Friday.</v>

122
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I could make the pis tache Wednesday,</v>

123
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:46.771
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way I can make rock candy coming out of high was fucking vinegar.</v>

124
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:52.171
<v Speaker 1>Flavored rock can always get white distilled vinegar with a bottle of Gatorade</v>

125
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>and I'd be cranberries,</v>

126
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>but I try.</v>

127
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>So then I failed actress and I came up with another idea.</v>

128
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I forget about drinking.</v>

129
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take my own circumcised Dick and I'm going to pull the skin back</v>

130
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to pull them my products in there.</v>

131
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>I thought it out and I said to myself,</v>

132
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>what kills piss on the floor rocks,</v>

133
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>but I can't sneak that as the money.</v>

134
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.421
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

135
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>what's the next best thing to kill pace?</v>

136
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>So I figured out pool cleaners.</v>

137
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>So I went to my buddy's house who had a pool,</v>

138
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>you know those big things that you say,</v>

139
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>oh no rain.</v>

140
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.633
<v Speaker 1>And I grabbed it.</v>

141
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I drive it,</v>

142
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker.</v>

162
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I still came back positive.</v>

163
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>The chlorine the next day didn't hurt.</v>

164
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I went right to the halfway house and wash my dick off,</v>

165
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>but the next day I went to the business by,</v>

166
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Dick was like one of those.</v>

167
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>This was coming out of everywhere.</v>

168
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.981

170
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Then the last thing I figured it was Draino so I took drain on.</v>

171
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I bought it on my big dog home.</v>

172
00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:32.600

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I had fucking pissed with the Draino and this time dog.</v>

174
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>The thing was turning red right in front of me and about four days later I get a</v>

175
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.404

<v Speaker 1>there's a probation officer and they got to go into the check.</v>

182
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>There was a chick that I really liked when she goes,</v>

183
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.491
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you did,</v>

187
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what was in my system.</v>

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Some dog.</v>

00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>For a fucking month.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I get away with this shit.</v>

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>The saddest moment of your life is when your dick a sore.</v>

193
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It was something wrong with your debt.</v>

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Realize what have I done.</v>

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>And on the weekends he cuts your fucking Dick off and puts that fucking monkey</v>

196
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.091

00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>that checkout we met in Vegas with the artificial turf and the fucking hole that</v>

198
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:18.570
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

199
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>remember rather Riviera's member revealed the security came and tapped.</v>

200
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>As you're talking to a fucking Harvey,</v>

201
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>don't get confused.</v>

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Beat that dirty oil.</v>

204
00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>He's the day from Michigan.</v>

205
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy bitch.</v>

206
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking in the ass in Seattle and I felt something hit my deck.</v>

207
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So I looked at her asshole like stuck like two fingers,</v>

208
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like something was hitting the top of my unit.</v>

209
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:38.331
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

210
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this sharp thing?</v>

211
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.910
<v Speaker 1>So I took my dick,</v>

212
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:41.991
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

213
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:42.824
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

214
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I just put two fingers and they searched around her.</v>

215
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.270
<v Speaker 1>So I far like a fucking little like a,</v>

218
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was all wrinkled up and it was like this was pointing over here and I</v>

219
00:06:58.371 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>just took it out and look at it.</v>

220
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like curly brownish.</v>

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I got to get to the weed store.</v>

254
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.611
<v Speaker 1>It is a great story.</v>

255
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was,</v>

256
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>cause I was thinking that standing up on the way up here and a friend Mike was</v>

257
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>selling weed and then one time he worked at CAA and he goes,</v>

258
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:18.561
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

259
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the interns over to him,</v>

260
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.533
<v Speaker 1>he blew up.</v>

261
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.800
<v Speaker 1>He ended up being Whitney Houston's manager</v>

262
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>in the tour manager and he's looking for powder.</v>

263
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>So every day they would come over and I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney</v>

264
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Houston,</v>

265
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 1>they would come over like $1,100 which was per diem money.</v>

267
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I was taking Whitney's per diem money,</v>

268
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:38.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

269
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Every day they come out with a little white envelope and give me the per diem</v>

270
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>money that go up to the Martell cartel and I buy 14 grams of Blo,</v>

271
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>take an eight ball out and cut it and then give it to Whitney Houston.</v>

272
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And they were fucking going crazy thing.</v>

273
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>This went on for 30 40 days,</v>

274
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.111
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't smell it.</v>

275
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:54.944
<v Speaker 1>All the blogs,</v>

276
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't store it.</v>

277
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much.</v>

278
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Then picking me up and nine or more than page of me on the Red Pager.</v>

279
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming downstairs,</v>

280
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.160
<v Speaker 1>getting in a car with them,</v>

281
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.810
<v Speaker 1>going through the Martell cards out to them,</v>

282
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 1>brothers going in the house with two grams of coke or when he cut in my pocket</v>

283
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and I would just go in and take rock sack,</v>

284
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.240
