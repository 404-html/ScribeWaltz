<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just make it one?</v>

29
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Why does everybody have to do a one?</v>

30
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>or the voice of bad.</v>

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:07.714
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't have that.</v>

48
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>People are at the gym gone and I'll tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

49
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>fuck Jamie's in my left ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a collection of all your</v>

50
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has changed in the world of bitcoin</v>

51
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>since the last time we spoke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spoke and we hung out in Vegas,</v>

52
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>which was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time with you.</v>

53
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

54
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.760
<v Speaker 1>what has changed in the world of bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the last time?</v>

55
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been about a year and a half almost</v>

56
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 2>and so much so much happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meantime.</v>

57
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 2>But we had a pretty slow 2015 and 2016</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick top again.</v>

58
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2015 still coming off a slow and gradual</v>

59
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 2>drop in the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were very reluctant and</v>

60
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 2>skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The media was constantly bashing</v>

61
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

62
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time we saw this really</v>

63
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 2>interesting phenomenon where the banks</v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting interested in this</v>

64
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

65
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.180
<v Speaker 4>not bitcoin itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

66
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 4>the blockchain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technology behind Bitcoin,</v>

67
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 4>which is rather amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

68
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I look at that a bit as if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

69
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 4>the Horse Buggy Association of America</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going,</v>

70
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we like this automobile thing you've</v>

71
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 4>designed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have a very big investment in Hay</v>

72
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 4>and horses and stables and veterinarian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

73
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna use the technology behind</v>

74
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 4>the automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pneumatic tire,</v>

75
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 4>and we're going to revolutionize horse</v>
<v Speaker 4>buggies.</v>

76
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying,</v>

77
00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in all fairness,</v>

78
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird thing to invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to go all in on bitcoin.</v>

79
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you do it,</v>

80
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>but you also make all of your money this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

81
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:44.580
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a proselytizing person when it</v>

83
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:47.364
<v Speaker 1>comes to Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for good reason.</v>

85
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 1>But for the average person saves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved up actual cash money their whole</v>

86
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:59.550
<v Speaker 1>life and is involved in this established</v>
<v Speaker 1>system of money to throw all their money</v>

87
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:01.620
<v Speaker 1>into Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be insane.</v>

88
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>You watched the money fluctuate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes up and it goes down when I'm</v>

89
00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:05.840
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you said that,</v>

90
00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that it would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

91
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a terrible idea.</v>

92
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that that's probably</v>

93
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:15.441
<v Speaker 1>why the media bashes it and why banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just looking at it going like people</v>

94
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.720
<v Speaker 1>see that there's a growing number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are using it for</v>

95
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>transactions.</v>

96
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.610
<v Speaker 1>There's Bitcoin ATM is now and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are using it to,</v>

97
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>to purchase things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's several companies that accept</v>

98
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin for products for actual real</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical products.</v>

99
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.760
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's not an investment and it</v>

100
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:35.130
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be treated as an investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't even mean like as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>

102
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean as like a primary source of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

103
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of if you decided to take all of your</v>

104
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as an investment,</v>

105
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>but just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

106
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>going to live off a bit coin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to spend bitcoin.</v>

107
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Like your money is going to go up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

108
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be really hard.</v>

109
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

110
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 4>if you're accustomed to privileged</v>
<v Speaker 4>banking,</v>

111
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.150
<v Speaker 4>like if you have the kind of banking</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have in this country,</v>

112
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.100
<v Speaker 4>if you actually have access to that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a,</v>

113
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:10.101
<v Speaker 4>a nice visa debit card and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain account fees and your money doesn't</v>

114
00:05:11.091 --> 00:05:15.230
<v Speaker 4>get confiscated by a dictator too often</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

115
00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 4>you can earn your money and interact</v>
<v Speaker 4>with other people,</v>

116
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 4>then why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you use bitcoin?</v>

117
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.550
<v Speaker 4>The simple answer is that's not really</v>
<v Speaker 4>the use case,</v>

118
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 4>but there are lots of people around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world who simply don't have access to</v>

119
00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for them,</v>

120
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in many cases,</v>

121
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 4>big coin is the stable currency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

122
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Asca,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an Argentinian,</v>

123
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 4>Venezuelan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Brazilian,</v>

124
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.513
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

125
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Supriya to Greek and the list goes on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on and on.</v>

126
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're worried about volatility</v>

127
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.850
<v Speaker 4>in bitcoin and in many cases if they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard of it,</v>

128
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 4>if they've used it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the stable currency.</v>

129
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Speaker 4>Their national currency is far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far worse.</v>

130
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you say Brazil?</v>

131
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil has had to massive devaluation</v>

132
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 4>the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much devaluation?</v>

133
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 4>Cause I know that they have experienced</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a really radical economic</v>

134
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 4>downturn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really interesting because a</v>

135
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 4>few years ago when we first started</v>
<v Speaker 4>going into Brazil,</v>

136
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 4>their economy was booming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

137
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 4>W We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying the UFC,</v>

138
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in a currency crisis right now.</v>

139
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Massive currency crisis that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

140
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 4>a apart from the political crisis that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on,</v>

141
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 4>and I won't speak for that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a Brazilian,</v>

142
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've had impeachment proceedings.</v>

143
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.330
<v Speaker 4>They just impeached their president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

144
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 4>there's been a lot of economic</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficulty with the country and I think</v>

145
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their currency has devalued almost 30%</v>

146
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 4>in the last year of 20 or 30%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some staggering amount.</v>

147
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Currencies don't move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mainstream national currencies that have</v>

148
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 4>very large economies behind them simply</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't move like that.</v>

149
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 4>We've seen it happen on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of times we've seen it happen</v>

150
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:46.761
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Greece,</v>

151
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 4>in Cyprus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the economic crisis.</v>

152
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 4>We saw it happen in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

153
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 4>during brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if we've seen it in places like</v>

154
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 4>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Venezuela,</v>

155
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 4>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and places like that,</v>

156
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 4>how much currency did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of a percentage of Britain you</v>

157
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 4>lose during brexit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost 20% in a day.</v>

158
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And three things responded to that's in</v>

159
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 4>the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold,</v>

160
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.530
<v Speaker 4>the Japanese yen and bitcoin heading in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the exact opposite direction,</v>

161
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 4>a bit coin climb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20% that they almost really,</v>

162
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 4>so did Britain rebound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

163
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 4>it did a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still in historic close.</v>

164
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm multi decade lows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they took a really big hit.</v>

165
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 4>And what we've seen again and again is</v>
<v Speaker 4>at times of crisis,</v>

166
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we see this pattern repeating where</v>

167
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 4>people use bitcoin as a safe haven</v>
<v Speaker 4>investment to get money out of a</v>

168
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 4>national currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially where there are very strict</v>

169
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 4>currency capital controls.</v>

170
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 4>So one of the reasons we've seen a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>coin,</v>

171
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 4>probably one of the reasons we've seen a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of activity with bitcoin in China is</v>

172
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 4>because of currency controls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time the yuan,</v>

173
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese currency devalues against</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dollar and it's done.</v>

174
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:04.841
<v Speaker 4>So I think four times in the last here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time there's a massive uptick in</v>

175
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin buying in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people are parking the money in</v>

176
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin or using it to convert it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>other currencies and get money out of</v>

177
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 4>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is the biggest fluctuation that</v>

178
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin is had?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

179
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 4>well it depends whether you look at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a monetary basis or on a percentage</v>

180
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 4>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the movements now,</v>

181
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 4>it can go up 30 40 even a hundred bucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a day.</v>

182
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which seems like a lot,</v>

183
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 4>but as a percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest fluctuations that had were</v>

184
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:42.101
<v Speaker 4>in 2010 and 2011 when it rose from under</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dollar or two over $30 and then back</v>

185
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 4>down to under a dollar in a period of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of months.</v>

186
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.160
<v Speaker 4>For people who don't understand what</v>
<v Speaker 4>this means when you're saying it,</v>

187
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.920
<v Speaker 4>a hundred bucks or a dollar $30 like</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

188
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:58.921
<v Speaker 4>What does that in relationship to one</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin one bitcoin equals $30 in 2011.</v>

189
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 4>And what does it equal right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>617 $617 Jesus,</v>

190
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 4>it was about $230 at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this gear.</v>

191
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 4>So it's seen a massive ramp pop and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>renewal of interest that,</v>

192
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so massive ramp up,</v>

193
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 4>but like what's the fluctuation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if it's at 616 is that what you said?</v>

194
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tripled since the beginning of the</v>

195
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 4>year almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible that it could drop to</v>

196
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 4>like 200 tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

197
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 4>See that scares the shit out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

198
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.490
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and which is why you know at,</v>

199
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 4>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the,</v>

200
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 4>here's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over the seven years that it's existed,</v>

201
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:42.190
<v Speaker 4>the fall utility as a percentage has</v>
<v Speaker 4>been going down every single here.</v>

202
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 4>So as the economy gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bigger it is,</v>

203
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 4>the more stable it is.</v>

204
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 4>Eight doesn't get buffeted around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

205
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 4>It's just like a very large boats</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get pushed around by the waves.</v>

206
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 4>And bitcoin is like a Zodiac next to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>U S dollars titanic.</v>

207
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 4>And the Little Zodiac is bouncing up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>down on the waves a lot terrain.</v>

208
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 4>And it might be uncomfortable at times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

209
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 4>if you're heading to an iceberg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be in the thing that can</v>

210
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:13.400
<v Speaker 4>actually turn on a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to look at it.</v>

211
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:14.071
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

212
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a fair analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good way of looking at it.</v>

213
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 4>It's fall a and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of,</v>

214
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 4>it's part of the fact that a 10 to $12</v>
<v Speaker 4>billion economy stretched across the</v>

215
00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 4>entire globe is a small economy as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>currency.</v>

216
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.560
<v Speaker 4>Now in the interest of making this a</v>
<v Speaker 4>standalone podcast.</v>

217
00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 4>So people are not going to go back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to all the other podcasts that</v>

218
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:32.874
<v Speaker 4>we've done.</v>

219
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Explain very briefly if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is bitcoin and how does it work?</v>

220
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad I have this opportunity to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it again because every time we have a</v>

221
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 4>new audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so bitcoin is Internet money.</v>

222
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 4>It's a system of money that exists on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet,</v>

223
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 4>was created on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it allows you to send and receive</v>

224
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 4>value the the same way you can send and</v>
<v Speaker 4>receive an email anywhere in the world</v>

225
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously without intermediaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

226
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 4>and that's kind of what you see at first</v>
<v Speaker 4>glance behind that.</v>

227
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a whole platform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

228
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 4>As the title of the book says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet of money.</v>

229
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a set of protocols that allow you</v>

230
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 4>to basically exchange value with other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

231
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 4>But you can do a lot more with it than</v>
<v Speaker 4>just that.</v>

232
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Most people will use it as a currency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's basically money that you can</v>

233
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.130
<v Speaker 4>transmit from your smartphone to</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else's smartphone directly,</v>

234
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 4>just like cash.</v>

235
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but electronic,</v>

236
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.940
<v Speaker 4>and the thing about it that's unique is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's not owned by any corporation,</v>

237
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.700
<v Speaker 4>any bank or any government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like the web isn't told by anyone</v>

238
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.060
<v Speaker 4>or email isn't told by anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's lots of companies that can</v>

239
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 4>send and receive email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of companies that can set</v>

240
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 4>up websites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of companies that can set</v>

241
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:55.611
<v Speaker 4>up applications that use bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I should say that when you set it up</v>

242
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time he did it,</v>

243
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of people donated bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what I did was I'd said whatever</v>

244
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 4>people donated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would match.</v>

245
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 4>I would double it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we would donate it to fight for</v>

246
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 4>the forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've build wells in the Congo and we</v>

247
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 4>built,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how many Justin Wren</v>

248
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a,</v>

249
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't even remember how much money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was many thousands of dollars</v>

250
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 4>people donated and then I doubled it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we sent it over to the Congo.</v>

251
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 4>So the bitcoin community is very</v>
<v Speaker 4>generous,</v>

252
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:31.651
<v Speaker 4>is my point that that is true and part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that generosity comes from the fact</v>

253
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of the people in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>community are very excited about this</v>

254
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 4>technology and want to share it without</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

255
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 4>They want to tell other people about</v>
<v Speaker 4>this technology.</v>

256
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.080
<v Speaker 4>It's really quite interesting what</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens when you create a form of money</v>

257
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:51.130
<v Speaker 4>that is truly global and we really don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have forms of money that a truly global,</v>

258
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even even with your very advanced</v>

259
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 4>banking system and your access to all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the technology that you have in the</v>

260
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 4>American banking system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you try to send money to some</v>

261
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost impossible to do.</v>

262
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 4>And I experienced this every time I get</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid in Bitcoin,</v>

263
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll go into a conference in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

264
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.080
<v Speaker 4>and I'll do one conference with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>banking industry and one conference with</v>

265
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:16.660
<v Speaker 4>the bitcoin community and the little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin conference.</v>

266
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be free to attend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

267
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't make any money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they sometimes cover some of my</v>

268
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:25.351
<v Speaker 4>expenses and I'll send an invoice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the banking industry conference will</v>

269
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 4>send me a wire transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes on average four weeks for me to</v>

270
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 4>get it with several calls to find out</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it went,</v>

271
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 4>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did it get lost?</v>

272
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 4>And it takes me on average 15 minutes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get paid in bit coin,</v>

273
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 4>no matter which country and being paid</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he,</v>

274
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 4>this is the cynic in me is this because</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they take the money and they're</v>

275
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 4>transferring it and they're moving it</v>
<v Speaker 4>around and now it's sitting in banks.</v>

276
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 4>When banks have money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they have your money,</v>

277
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 4>even if it's just for a few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the opportunity to use that</v>

278
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 4>money to make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they doing that?</v>

279
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

280
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 4>it certainly doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

281
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't hurt to keep it a bit longer.</v>

282
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it primarily because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

283
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 4>because the system has a series of</v>
<v Speaker 4>intermediaries and each of those</v>

284
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 4>intermediaries represent a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If one of those intermediary says,</v>

285
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I have the money for Mr Antonopoulos</v>
<v Speaker 4>wire and you give that money to</v>

286
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Antonopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the intermediary doesn't give it to</v>

287
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're out of money.</v>

288
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's those risks with every</v>

289
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 4>intermediate you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's risk.</v>

290
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 4>And that's called counterparty risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

291
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.420
<v Speaker 4>because of the way the banking system is</v>
<v Speaker 4>with perhaps five,</v>

292
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven intermediaries in a single</v>

293
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 4>transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that creates a lot of cumulative risk.</v>

294
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 4>And they protect without risk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by slowing things down.</v>

295
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 4>And that risk doesn't exist in bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's from one party directly to</v>

296
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No counter parties.</v>

297
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the core principles.</v>

298
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this conversation with my bank and</v>

299
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>said I had done this um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference in Germany,</v>

300
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Frankfurt at the headquarters of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bundesbank.</v>

301
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Now for those of your viewers or</v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners who don't know,</v>

302
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:11.501
<v Speaker 2>the Bundesbank is the Federal Bank of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and they probably consider the</v>

303
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.160
<v Speaker 2>United States Federal Reserve to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocre creditor compared to the</v>

304
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Bundesbank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like the best credit rating on</v>

305
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 2>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

306
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to speak at a conference</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they're paying me for my</v>

307
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 2>expenses and they send a wire transfer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I call my bank and after four weeks</v>

308
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 2>they finally find it and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've received your bank,</v>

309
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 2>your bank wire transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to hold it</v>

310
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 2>because of the risk profile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

311
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Well you haven't been paid by this</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular payer before,</v>

312
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to put a hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said,</v>

313
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.630
<v Speaker 2>you do know this is the Bundesbank</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are holding.</v>

314
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.620
<v Speaker 2>And they held it for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are holding for two weeks because of</v>

315
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>the credit risk of the Federal Bank of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

316
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 2>the most credit worthy institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to receive money from</v>

317
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 2>this isn't even something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

319
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.580
<v Speaker 2>if even they campaign me in the age of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet instantaneously,</v>

320
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.790
<v Speaker 2>there is something wrong with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>banking system.</v>

321
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>And there is because I got paid for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin conference who was doing in the</v>

322
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:29.300
<v Speaker 2>same town instantaneously.</v>

323
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>But there's also concern on their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their end about fraud,</v>

324
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean isn't it,</v>

325
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but there's fraud with bitcoin as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

326
00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

327
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that issue with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys that were investigating the</v>

328
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 1>dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that the agents were</v>

329
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 1>stealing bitcoin to the tune of hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of dollars.</v>

330
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that the case with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

331
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.280
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

332
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.290
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference,</v>

333
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.460
<v Speaker 2>the difference is a difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic fraud,</v>

334
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.470
<v Speaker 2>an individual case of fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

335
00:16:58.471 --> 00:17:00.600
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

336
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.300
<v Speaker 2>in Bitcoin as in the traditional banking</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

337
00:17:03.301 --> 00:17:06.300
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a bank or an organization</v>

338
00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:09.450
<v Speaker 2>concentrates a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can go in and steal it.</v>

339
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.370
<v Speaker 2>You basically robbed the Bitcoin Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like people rob the normal bank.</v>

340
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And how would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just hack into it.</v>

341
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.410
<v Speaker 2>So they hack in and they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this has happened many,</v>

342
00:17:19.411 --> 00:17:24.390
<v Speaker 2>many times and this is a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin banks as opposed to person to</v>

343
00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:26.040
<v Speaker 2>person exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

344
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Because the whole point of pick coin is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't need to put your money in</v>

345
00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:34.281
<v Speaker 2>the custody of someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if instead you use bitcoin as it is</v>

346
00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.880
<v Speaker 2>intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everybody keeps control of their</v>

347
00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:41.460
<v Speaker 2>own money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then in order to hack all of those</v>

348
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:46.200
<v Speaker 2>people either have to hack the bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>protocol itself has not happened in</v>

349
00:17:46.201 --> 00:17:48.540
<v Speaker 2>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way it's structured is</v>

350
00:17:48.541 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do or you</v>

351
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 4>have to hack each individual account</v>
<v Speaker 4>holder and you can hack individual</v>

352
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 4>account holders depending on their level</v>
<v Speaker 4>of security and sophistication.</v>

353
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

354
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 4>to get very large amounts you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait for them to give their money to</v>

355
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 4>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was that exchange?</v>

356
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.860
<v Speaker 4>The bitcoin bank that started off as</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a fantasy website and some,</v>

357
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 4>what was that again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

358
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 4>this was a Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gox in Japan,</v>

359
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 4>the magic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gathering online,</v>

360
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.570
<v Speaker 4>which they see in the early days of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bitcoin,</v>

361
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 4>there were no exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to think back like,</v>

362
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 4>do you remember on the web,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

363
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 4>in the early days when even the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

364
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 4>the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most sophisticated corporations had a</v>

365
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 4>page with a single logon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gray background,</v>

366
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 4>and some flashing lights that said under</v>
<v Speaker 4>construction,</v>

367
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 4>like in 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where we are in bitcoin's still.</v>

368
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were no,</v>

369
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well-run exchanges at the time.</v>

370
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 4>It was very difficult to buy and sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin.</v>

371
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.250
<v Speaker 4>And so this guy in Japan had a site that</v>
<v Speaker 4>could trade these magic,</v>

372
00:18:55.621 --> 00:19:00.621
<v Speaker 4>the gathering online cards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he converted the sites to trade</v>

373
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 4>currencies instead to create trade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cryptocurrencies.</v>

374
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Turns out it's a lot easier to hack in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and steal cryptocurrencies than it is to</v>

375
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 4>steal the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever happened with that,</v>

376
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 4>because the story was like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of dollars in bitcoins,</v>

377
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:19.120
<v Speaker 4>just hundreds of millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions.</v>

378
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 4>They didn't vanish that inventors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone stole it.</v>

379
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.130
<v Speaker 4>They got stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got cycled through the economy and</v>

380
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:30.030
<v Speaker 4>they're back in the economy now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just not with the same owners.</v>

381
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 4>No one knows who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one knows who.</v>

382
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 4>That seems bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you rob a bank,</v>

383
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 4>like they can put a trace on the bills</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can figure it out eventually.</v>

384
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 4>And most people get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

385
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

386
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:43.044
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

387
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they if you,</v>

388
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 4>if you do wire fraud perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in many cases with cash,</v>

389
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.240
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin is like cash.</v>

390
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is equally untraceable it's very</v>

391
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 4>difficult to actually catch like I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently,</v>

392
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:58.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading about the FBI closing the</v>

393
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 4>DB cooper case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the Guy who robbed the bank,</v>

394
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Speaker 4>got into seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one seven aircraft,</v>

395
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Speaker 4>opened the rear state case and jumped</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to the parachute over the midwest</v>

396
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.640
<v Speaker 4>and was never seen again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

397
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that guy died though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

398
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.570
<v Speaker 4>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that would be a convenient,</v>

399
00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 4>a explanation for the failure of the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 4>to catch him.</v>

400
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be convenient,</v>

401
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 4>but also didn't he like drop into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>woods?</v>

402
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the details.</v>

403
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.260
<v Speaker 4>They never found him body or money ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

404
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.500
<v Speaker 4>But that can happen pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be more likely or more,</v>

405
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apt to believe that if someone dropped</v>

406
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 4>in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of parachute with some fucking</v>

407
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:45.270
<v Speaker 4>haphazard gear and leapt out of the back</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a plane,</v>

408
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 4>they probably died.</v>

409
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Probably got eaten by bears or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

410
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.221
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

411
00:20:49.221 --> 00:20:52.760
<v Speaker 4>or found by a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a local woods.</v>

412
00:20:52.761 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 4>Men in the cabin who's like some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some dude fell out of the sky with a</v>

413
00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Satchel full of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some my money.</v>

414
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.390
<v Speaker 4>I need a new chainsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

415
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.433
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

416
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 4>but when you're stealing money from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bank,</v>

417
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 4>can't they trace the serial numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you steal cash,</v>

418
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 4>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

419
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a robbery,</v>

420
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:16.180
<v Speaker 4>stick them up and you pointed a gun at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the teller and they fill up the bag with</v>

421
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 4>currency and you run out the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't they have like a trace on that</v>

422
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:21.370
<v Speaker 4>money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where they can,</v>

423
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 4>if you spend the really ash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

424
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.281
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>

425
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 4>And they can't because they have all</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of,</v>

426
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

427
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 4>if they had a batch of sequentially</v>
<v Speaker 4>numbered clean money,</v>

428
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.900
<v Speaker 4>but that's not how most banks work.</v>

429
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 4>What the money they have on hand is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that came,</v>

430
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:38.960
<v Speaker 4>deposited it in the last week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

431
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 4>by various people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cash businesses like Delis and grocery</v>

432
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.590
<v Speaker 4>stores and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have no idea what the numbers</v>

433
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.250
<v Speaker 4>on those bills are and they don't trace</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

434
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 4>It's simply considered part of the risk</v>
<v Speaker 4>of business.</v>

435
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 4>And what does this avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cooper's money before.</v>

436
00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of it get this out of the left side</v>

437
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:03.300
<v Speaker 4>of my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bad cable after Resa.</v>

438
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No sign of DB.</v>

439
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Cooper ever emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Investigators doubt he survived and</v>

440
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 4>never been able to determine his true</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity.</v>

441
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:14.260
<v Speaker 4>But a boy digging on the Columbia River</v>
<v Speaker 4>beach in 1980 found three bundles of</v>

442
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 4>weathered $20 bills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cooper's cash.</v>

443
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 4>According to the serial numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's dead as fuck.</v>

444
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 4>They found his money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of his money.</v>

445
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 4>What did he like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Left song of cause being sneaky.</v>

446
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to pretend I'm dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just leave some of this here.</v>

447
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>

448
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 4>They only found like a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they recovered more than a</v>

449
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 4>tiny fraction of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

450
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know.</v>

451
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the details when she's</v>

452
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.130
<v Speaker 4>dealing with 200 grand though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was only like $200,000 in</v>

453
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 4>those days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could pay the national debt with</v>

454
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 4>that kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year was it?</v>

455
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Like sixties 71 there's a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 4>in those days.</v>

456
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 4>That db cooper stores and interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

457
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.410
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people love a story like that where</v>

458
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 4>people don't get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

459
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:59.620
<v Speaker 4>The mystery of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the Mt.</v>

460
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Gox thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The exchange is kind of a mystery to,</v>

461
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:06.841
<v Speaker 4>it's $100 million or many hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of dollar mystery inside story</v>

462
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 4>of Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gox bitcoins,</v>

463
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:12.370
<v Speaker 4>$460 million disaster for 60 look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy.</v>

464
00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:15.290
<v Speaker 4>They're leading them around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's marlene embark palace.</v>

465
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 4>Who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

466
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.720
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy who is now out on parole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

467
00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 4>or on or pending trial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that guy's out $460 million and he's</v>

468
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

469
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:26.800
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

470
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 4>is he responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just cause he's retarded.</v>

471
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.410
<v Speaker 4>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things we,</v>

472
00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 4>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe we'll never know how much of</v>

473
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 4>that response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was deliberate,</v>

474
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.380
<v Speaker 4>whether it was an inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was a complaint,</v>

475
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.170
<v Speaker 4>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

476
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 4>he was certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was enormous,</v>

477
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.090
<v Speaker 4>of incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enormous.</v>

478
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 4>That's clear.</v>

479
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you listen to him talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him in speeches when he's</v>

480
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 1>discussing the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

481
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:53.810
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

482
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

483
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.530
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the,</v>

484
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.500
<v Speaker 4>have you heard Bernie madoff talk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

485
00:23:58.501 --> 00:23:59.070
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

486
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

487
00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:01.200
<v Speaker 4>the thing is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even,</v>

488
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.570
<v Speaker 4>even the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the interesting thing is that just</v>

489
00:24:03.571 --> 00:24:06.480
<v Speaker 4>up to the day before Bernie madoff was</v>
<v Speaker 4>indicted,</v>

490
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.380
<v Speaker 4>indicted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the top trusted name on Wall</v>

491
00:24:10.381 --> 00:24:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had the most stellar credit rating.</v>

492
00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:16.500
<v Speaker 4>He was the head of the credit rating</v>
<v Speaker 4>agency for,</v>

493
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those types of funds that he was rated</v>

494
00:24:19.111 --> 00:24:20.730
<v Speaker 4>under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

495
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 4>and the next day he's a CROC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

496
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.390
<v Speaker 4>you can see these things happen</v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout human history.</v>

497
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Changing the form of money used doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>change that.</v>

498
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.580
<v Speaker 4>But if he changed the architecture of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money and you make it less necessary,</v>

499
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

500
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:43.020
<v Speaker 4>less useful to concentrate the money in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hands of third parties that has an</v>

501
00:24:43.021 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that</v>

502
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues with this something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mt Gox or with any banking system</v>

503
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.200
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other than the bitcoin system with,</v>

504
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.951
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

505
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 4>the problem is the counterparty risk if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give your money to other people.</v>

506
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:59.990
<v Speaker 4>The entire reason we have oversight in</v>
<v Speaker 4>banking is because of the simple truth</v>

507
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 4>that if you give your money to other</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

508
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:04.080
<v Speaker 4>eventually they'll try to steal it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

509
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.180
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only reason they,</v>

510
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 4>they don't cause someone in the bank is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have a tremendous need.</v>

511
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 4>The tremendous gambling problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

512
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.000
<v Speaker 4>an addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

513
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

514
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Or just have a lack of empathy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>social socialization and just be,</v>

515
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>

516
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they don't even have to be crooked.</v>

517
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:30.170
<v Speaker 4>They can make a mistake and trading and</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to cover it up with customer</v>

518
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can have a debt there.</v>

519
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Their parents may require an expensive</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery that they can't afford.</v>

520
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 4>commit financial fraud and not all of it</v>

521
00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:44.740
<v Speaker 4>is because they're just greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil assholes,</v>

522
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.560
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

523
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is that all of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>oversight system we have in banking,</v>

524
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 4>which by the way fails again and again</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again and again to protect and</v>

525
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 4>regular people from these thefts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of these systems we have exists for</v>

526
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 4>that one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the answer is not build better</v>

527
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:04.990
<v Speaker 4>systems to watch the people who hold</v>
<v Speaker 4>your money is,</v>

528
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.320
<v Speaker 4>the answer is that bitcoin gives us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't let others hold your money,</v>

529
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 4>hold your own money and then you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this problem.</v>

530
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.290
<v Speaker 4>There was</v>

531
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.960
<v Speaker 1>recent investigative report about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

532
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.760
<v Speaker 1>a firm in Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it's Atlanta that has a</v>

533
00:26:20.761 --> 00:26:25.560
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously high rate of success with</v>
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>

534
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And they interviewed the Guy who runs it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know his reasons for why they're</v>

535
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.850
<v Speaker 1>so wildly successful and they make so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more money than anybody else.</v>

536
00:26:35.851 --> 00:26:38.850
<v Speaker 1>We're very suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're closing in on this guy,</v>

537
00:26:38.851 --> 00:26:42.480
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on over here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they think that not only is the</v>

538
00:26:42.481 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Bernie model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just Bernie Madoff,</v>

539
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that it's common and that</v>

540
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be supplementing legitimate investments</v>

541
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:58.611
<v Speaker 1>with a pyramid scheme and that it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard operational model for a lot</v>

542
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 1>of these firms because they've been able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull it off.</v>

543
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.230
<v Speaker 2>What we've seen again and again</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history in the area of</v>

544
00:27:06.231 --> 00:27:10.430
<v Speaker 2>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when there's a recession,</v>

545
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:15.490
<v Speaker 2>when there is a drop in income and</v>
<v Speaker 2>profitability for everyone,</v>

546
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that event is actually really good for</v>

547
00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:20.660
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it washes out the</v>

548
00:27:20.661 --> 00:27:23.060
<v Speaker 2>frauds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's washes out the failures,</v>

549
00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:25.340
<v Speaker 2>it washes out the unprofitable</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses.</v>

550
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a great cleansing event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

551
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Because the tide recedes and suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see who's not wearing swimming</v>

552
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:34.420
<v Speaker 2>trunks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

553
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.630
<v Speaker 2>we knew there was something fishy going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on under the water,</v>

554
00:27:38.631 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

555
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that happens in,</v>

556
00:27:43.431 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 2>in Wall Street's all of those companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were simply reinvesting the,</v>

557
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:52.160
<v Speaker 2>the recent gains to pay the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are withdrawing their money or the</v>

558
00:27:52.161 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 2>retirees that are supporting in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>pension fund,</v>

559
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:55.760
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly they don't,</v>

560
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 2>they can't do that to any more.</v>

561
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.370
<v Speaker 2>They're washed out of the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A badly performing businesses</v>

562
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.490
<v Speaker 2>unprofitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As all of these things get washed out.</v>

563
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.860
<v Speaker 2>We haven't been doing this in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country for the last three decades.</v>

564
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is every time there's a</v>

565
00:28:12.381 --> 00:28:16.130
<v Speaker 2>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fed steps in a or the government</v>

566
00:28:16.131 --> 00:28:20.480
<v Speaker 2>steps in and basically they pump water</v>
<v Speaker 2>to raise the tide again,</v>

567
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as possible.</v>

568
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And that means that a lot of the crux</v>
<v Speaker 2>float from recession to recession</v>

569
00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:31.751
<v Speaker 2>without getting revealed worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it encourages that kind of behavior.</v>

570
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And so you get all of these businesses</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose only ability to make profits is</v>

571
00:28:37.641 --> 00:28:41.570
<v Speaker 2>when the interest rates to zero and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's $20 billion a month being</v>

572
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:46.571
<v Speaker 2>injected by the Fed and their business</v>
<v Speaker 2>model is take that and lend it to</v>

573
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.960
<v Speaker 2>consumers for 29 99 Apr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

574
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Or do payday loans or sub prime loans or</v>
<v Speaker 2>sub prime auto student loans,</v>

575
00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:57.380
<v Speaker 2>mortgages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

576
00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:58.214
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

577
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.020
<v Speaker 2>You need a cleansing events to wash out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fraud.</v>

578
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the example of a forest fire.</v>

579
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.620
<v Speaker 2>If you suppress all of the small fires</v>
<v Speaker 2>will happens,</v>

580
00:29:09.621 --> 00:29:12.770
<v Speaker 2>is eventually you build up a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>undergrowth in the forest.</v>

581
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.390
<v Speaker 2>A small fire doesn't kill the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just cleans out the undergrowth.</v>

582
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.530
<v Speaker 2>You keep putting out the fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've seen since the 70s here in</v>

583
00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:24.350
<v Speaker 2>the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You let all of the undergrowth grow up.</v>

584
00:29:24.351 --> 00:29:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Then when a fire comes through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a little forest fire,</v>

585
00:29:28.161 --> 00:29:32.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a raging inferno now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't put it out and it burns the</v>

586
00:29:32.481 --> 00:29:36.860
<v Speaker 2>trees and destroys the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sterilizes the top foot of soil.</v>

587
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 2>We've seen this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

588
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And so this is now happening in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our economy,</v>

589
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 2>which is that all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

590
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 2>bubble creation doesn't get washed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a recession.</v>

591
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.080
<v Speaker 2>More stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more funding.</v>

592
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.420
<v Speaker 2>The Federal Reserve pumps more money</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the economy.</v>

593
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Trillions of dollars since 2008 and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stimulus,</v>

594
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 2>where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes into inflating not one bubble.</v>

595
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 2>We had real estates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we have real estates and</v>

596
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:11.310
<v Speaker 2>subprime auto and student loans and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

597
00:30:11.311 --> 00:30:15.940
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bonds and stocks and currencies all</v>

598
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.620
<v Speaker 2>inflating at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

599
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 2>is it possible to do a controlled burn</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the economy?</v>

600
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some places where they want to,</v>

601
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with the issue that,</v>

602
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about how there's stop</v>

603
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 2>forest fires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's theoretically part of the mandate</v>

604
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 2>of the Federal Reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most people don't realize is a</v>

605
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 2>private corporation owned by the banks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not a government agency.</v>

606
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tricky name.</v>

607
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal Reserve has nothing to do with</v>

608
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

609
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of gross.</v>

610
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

611
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I can't name say my publishing company</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the book,</v>

612
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:50.181
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

613
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 2>the federal publisher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

614
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 2>they won't allow me to put the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal in the name of my company as</v>

615
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

616
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 2>But in order to create an organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

617
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.370
<v Speaker 2>you need an act of Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

618
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually what you need is an act of</v>

619
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Congress passed in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night on a recess,</v>

620
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly how they pass the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal Reserve Act in 1913.</v>

621
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.720
<v Speaker 2>It has a long ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

622
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep that name.</v>

623
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 2>But there is federal ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just say that you could buy</v>

624
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 2>bullets company called federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>ammunition,</v>

625
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.900
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government interest is to good good</v>

626
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:25.220
<v Speaker 2>company to buy bullets from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

627
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the controlled burn idea,</v>

628
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 2>how would you apply that to the economy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

629
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 2>if what we're talking about raise the</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest rates,</v>

630
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 2>you raised them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

631
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.750
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drains the waste.</v>

632
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Drains the swamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise the interest rates.</v>

633
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Basically the infrastructure controls</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost of money.</v>

634
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:51.361
<v Speaker 2>If you make money more expensive than</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who borrowed have to have a pretty</v>

635
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:55.630
<v Speaker 2>good rate of investment in return on</v>
<v Speaker 2>their investment to invest that.</v>

636
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they don't borrow money.</v>

637
00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's an extremely unpopular idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

638
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get that across?</v>

639
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>

640
00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:05.100
<v Speaker 2>it's an unpopular idea because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

641
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:10.170
<v Speaker 2>it benefits savers instead of debtors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

642
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have savings,</v>

643
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a time when I could get a</v>

644
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:19.150
<v Speaker 2>certificate of deposit for my savings in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bank and I could get 3% here,</v>

645
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.800
<v Speaker 2>3%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

646
00:32:20.801 --> 00:32:21.730
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

647
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't get 0.3% now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So savers get wiped out.</v>

648
00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're a retiree who's got all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their money in savings right now,</v>

649
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 2>the return you're getting on those</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings isn't enough to cover your cost</v>

650
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 2>of living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your money basically is shrinking.</v>

651
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tax on savers that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 1>benefits debtors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for a large debtors like the</v>

653
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:45.290
<v Speaker 1>federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 1>It's such a complicated system that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person that's working all</v>

655
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.750
<v Speaker 1>day and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get home,</v>

656
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you have hobbies and family and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want to do,</v>

657
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to get a grip on</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how money works.</v>

658
00:32:59.240 --> 00:32:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

659
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:00.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of them.</v>

660
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found through my experiences doing</v>

661
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 2>these talks that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

662
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about that in the book too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the whole point of this particular</v>

663
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet of money is why bitcoin and</v>

664
00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I talk about the philosophy behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

665
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the topics of money that most people</v>

666
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's really astonishing is that</v>

667
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 2>here I am and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about is the greatest</v>

668
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 2>experiment in money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

669
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.460
<v Speaker 2>started in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2009 and this great experiment is</v>

670
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 2>completely unprecedented in the history</v>
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>

671
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about 22 central banks,</v>

672
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 2>similar caneously taking their interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate to zero and pumpings the largest</v>

673
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 2>amount of money ever created into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world economy trying to stop it from</v>

674
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:51.080
<v Speaker 2>collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has created the largest bubble</v>

675
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 2>in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the weird thing is that most people</v>

676
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:59.120
<v Speaker 2>are not even aware that they're living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a time what we are doing this</v>

677
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 2>completely unprecedented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>untested,</v>

678
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 2>no one knows where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge monetary experiments in which 2</v>

679
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 2>billion people are hostage as part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

680
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

681
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 2>And nobody knows where this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

682
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 2>But most economists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream economists say this doesn't</v>

683
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:20.000
<v Speaker 2>tend well</v>
<v Speaker 2>said mean though.</v>

684
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 2>And then we have the other level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>monetary experiment,</v>

685
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.413
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

686
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money on the Internet with a controlled</v>

687
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 2>issuance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only a certain amount of the money is</v>

688
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's controlled by a mathematical</v>

689
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 2>formula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't make more.</v>

690
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.320
<v Speaker 2>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a stable</v>

691
00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:40.390
<v Speaker 1>ply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sound money and it cannot be</v>

692
00:34:40.391 --> 00:34:42.700
<v Speaker 1>manipulated by governments or banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

693
00:34:42.701 --> 00:34:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's so confusing for anyone as it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get into the issue of what is</v>

694
00:34:47.681 --> 00:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>money and where's money coming from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does the Federal Reserve,</v>

695
00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 1>how does the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does anybody create more money?</v>

696
00:34:54.611 --> 00:34:57.460
<v Speaker 1>How do you print more money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are printing more money,</v>

697
00:34:57.461 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 1>where's it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is it debt.</v>

698
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is it like,</v>

699
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:05.470
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to be gold and it used to be the</v>

700
00:35:05.471 --> 00:35:07.570
<v Speaker 1>gold standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be if you had a dollar as a</v>

701
00:35:07.571 --> 00:35:10.480
<v Speaker 1>dollar's worth of gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a note that was worth a dollar's</v>

702
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:11.770
<v Speaker 1>worth of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

703
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.670
<v Speaker 1>that made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that stopped what</v>

704
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 2>first stopped in 1936,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

705
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Bretton Woods agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it stopped completely in 1971</v>

706
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 2>when Nixon closed the gold window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he basically said,</v>

707
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.670
<v Speaker 2>if anyone comes to your bank and gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>you one silver dollar or one gold dollar</v>

708
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my silver,</v>

709
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 2>you say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

710
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and basically defaulted on the backing</v>
<v Speaker 2>of US dollars,</v>

711
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:36.190
<v Speaker 2>buy gold.</v>

712
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I met this wacky guy</v>

713
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

714
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:46.190
<v Speaker 2>he was coming on the comedy store's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really odd guy for a bunch of reasons,</v>

715
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things is he carried a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun everywhere he went and he believed</v>

716
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.990
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed in precious gold coins that</v>

717
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:02.151
<v Speaker 2>were minted outside of the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and using those as currency.</v>

718
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he would have these coins that he</v>

719
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:05.701
<v Speaker 2>carried with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

720
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 2>And he would try to pay for things in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

721
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Colin's like gold and silver coins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly silver.</v>

722
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 2>It's silver coins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was trying to explain to me that</v>

723
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:16.560
<v Speaker 2>this is legal and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:20.490
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to accept these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very weird stuff.</v>

725
00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very odd,</v>

726
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:24.460
<v Speaker 2>he was very annoying too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as guys.</v>

727
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 2>They like talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept touching you,</v>

728
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 2>would talk to you and hold you and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like grab your arm and hold you and</v>

729
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.730
<v Speaker 2>touch you and all right fucker.</v>

730
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 2>What a year here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A control freak.</v>

731
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And he said it's like a weird control</v>
<v Speaker 2>freak.</v>

732
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's saying something to you and</v>

733
00:36:39.081 --> 00:36:40.950
<v Speaker 2>they are holding onto you whether saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to you,</v>

734
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 2>unless you're in love with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like you creates a very strange</v>

735
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

736
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Why are you holding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I get loose here?</v>

737
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.880
<v Speaker 2>What if I have to run away real quick so</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to break this grip.</v>

738
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 2>But this guy used to carry these coins</v>
<v Speaker 2>around with them.</v>

739
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking sack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes to touch his money.</v>

740
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Elvis off commercials and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

741
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 2>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like some weird fucking coin</v>

742
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:05.540
<v Speaker 2>with like an American Eagle on them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

743
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're minted in the u s full silver</v>

744
00:37:09.411 --> 00:37:11.010
<v Speaker 2>coins right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weird.</v>

745
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Weirdest fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weird if you tried to use them</v>

746
00:37:13.161 --> 00:37:17.240
<v Speaker 2>to buy a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although a lot of people buy these and</v>

747
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.360
<v Speaker 2>gold coins and small gold bars as</v>
<v Speaker 2>investments,</v>

748
00:37:20.361 --> 00:37:21.860
<v Speaker 2>they keep him in a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

749
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.390
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is if there is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant crash in the car and seat,</v>

750
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.710
<v Speaker 2>then these have holding value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

751
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

752
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.370
<v Speaker 2>it's I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly sane to say,</v>

753
00:37:34.371 --> 00:37:37.940
<v Speaker 2>if you have some money put aside in</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings,</v>

754
00:37:37.941 --> 00:37:40.090
<v Speaker 2>don't put it all in stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe diversify,</v>

755
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.220
<v Speaker 2>put a bit in precious metals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe put a bit in digital currencies,</v>

756
00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:45.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe put a bit in commodities and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

757
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of reasonable and fasting.</v>

758
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.370
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the people who have these kinds</v>

759
00:37:52.371 --> 00:37:57.371
<v Speaker 2>of attitudes come from families and from</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures where there has been a time in</v>

760
00:37:58.131 --> 00:38:02.240
<v Speaker 2>the past two generations where you leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the night with all of</v>

761
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:07.241
<v Speaker 2>your belongings in a pillowcase and with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with guns and dogs after you</v>

762
00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:11.810
<v Speaker 2>trying to murder you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this happens today in Syria,</v>

763
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

764
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.020
<v Speaker 2>it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

765
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.350
<v Speaker 2>one generation to go to my parents'</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation in,</v>

766
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.000
<v Speaker 2>in Greece with the Nazis.</v>

767
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.551
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

768
00:38:21.551 --> 00:38:26.551
<v Speaker 2>it happens to the Russian people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to people all over the world.</v>

769
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.360
<v Speaker 2>And when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

770
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.970
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it happens generation before,</v>

771
00:38:31.971 --> 00:38:33.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents tell you the stories,</v>

772
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different feeling.</v>

773
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't happened to most Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

774
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 2>in at least two or three generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when that happens,</v>

775
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 2>what do you put in the pillowcase?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you something,</v>

776
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 2>the pieces of paper are worthless when</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>

777
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's why some people do want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have physical coin.</v>

778
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we've noticed now is</v>

779
00:38:57.161 --> 00:39:01.630
<v Speaker 2>that digital currencies may start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>serve a role.</v>

780
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.400
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that you can memorize 12</v>
<v Speaker 2>English words and carry your entire</v>

781
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin wallets in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that well,</v>

782
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 2>you 12 English words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are those words?</v>

783
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Level celsion party on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

784
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:17.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

785
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you can generate a bitcoin wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

786
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And then make a backup of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for convenience,</v>

787
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 2>some of the inventors in the space</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed a system where you can back up</v>

788
00:39:26.561 --> 00:39:30.280
<v Speaker 2>any bitcoin wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it has millions and billions of</v>

789
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:35.281
<v Speaker 2>transactions and assets in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can back it up to between 12 and 24</v>

790
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 2>English words that are generated</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically by the program.</v>

791
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Be like that speech and pulp fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Samuel Jackson pulls a gun on that</v>

792
00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be your password.</v>

793
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

794
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.820
<v Speaker 2>you don't pick the words though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

795
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you don't pick the words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a series so forwards</v>

796
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

797
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:58.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asparagus forest,</v>

798
00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attorney and would've whatever all I</v>

799
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.090
<v Speaker 2>liked dix please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit on my head.</v>

800
00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sentences and snow where it's like</v>

801
00:40:06.391 --> 00:40:10.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about the power of being able</v>

802
00:40:10.471 --> 00:40:14.460
<v Speaker 2>to transport an unlimited amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money simply by memorizing 12 words that</v>

803
00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:16.530
<v Speaker 2>can't be confiscated from you when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a refugee.</v>

804
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Kate's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

805
00:40:17.641 --> 00:40:18.840
<v Speaker 1>you look the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

806
00:40:18.841 --> 00:40:23.820
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea behind it is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me and I've been a fan of</v>

807
00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it since the time I met you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before that I was reasonably</v>

808
00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:29.100
<v Speaker 1>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>

809
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:34.220
<v Speaker 1>having you a aluminate it in such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great way really made it much more,</v>

810
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more enticing and much more</v>

811
00:40:36.661 --> 00:40:38.760
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always been,</v>

812
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious from that point on as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's gonna go.</v>

813
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.063
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

814
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

815
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.900
<v Speaker 1>when I look at the landscape of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at the landscape of,</v>

816
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:53.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are willing to make this</v>

817
00:40:53.461 --> 00:40:56.220
<v Speaker 1>leap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it would take to get</v>

818
00:40:56.221 --> 00:41:01.221
<v Speaker 1>people fully onboard with Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe like you do that the</v>

819
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:04.980
<v Speaker 1>system that we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the banking system is incredibly corrupt</v>

820
00:41:04.981 --> 00:41:06.270
<v Speaker 1>and just bizarre</v>

821
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and fragile and frail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the thing that most</v>

822
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 2>people are missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks giant imposing.</v>

823
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.700
<v Speaker 2>It's been there for a century that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a sign of strength.</v>

824
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:23.310
<v Speaker 1>You find that the company in Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has this,</v>

825
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:28.381
<v Speaker 1>a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a return on your investment that's being</v>

826
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I found the right guy</v>

827
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

828
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>look again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

829
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be a bunch of those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that are doing that,</v>

830
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

831
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

832
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

833
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a system like that which is,</v>

834
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.090
<v Speaker 2>which is very opaque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most people don't understand,</v>

835
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>is the kind of system you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt because that's where you can</v>

836
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:52.130
<v Speaker 2>make the most money without anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing.</v>

837
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.993
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>financial crime is not really prosecuted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

839
00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2008 giants crisis,</v>

840
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 2>millions of homeowners kicked out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their homes,</v>

841
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:05.240
<v Speaker 2>illegal foreclosures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robo signing mills,</v>

842
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:05.681
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

843
00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:06.081
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

844
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:08.840
<v Speaker 2>The only person who went to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Madoff,</v>

845
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 2>who stole from the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everybody else.</v>

846
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Scottfree it is pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he was just a scape</v>

847
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 2>goat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

848
00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:20.560
<v Speaker 2>he was obviously a crook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was obviously a car.</v>

849
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 2>He was obviously a crook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a sociopath or something,</v>

850
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:28.301
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by hundreds and hundreds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of quirks in the same scale and</v>

851
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.370
<v Speaker 2>giant investment banks that are just as</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

852
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 2>And we don't see that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

853
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:38.690
<v Speaker 2>you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get pulled over for a busted</v>

854
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:43.691
<v Speaker 2>tail lights and thrown in jail in plenty</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the states in this country for six</v>

855
00:42:44.151 --> 00:42:49.151
<v Speaker 2>months for having an herb in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time,</v>

856
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 2>you can put a million people out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their homes through straight up fraud</v>

857
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.450
<v Speaker 2>with mountains of evidence and emails</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>

858
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 2>And they're untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That system,</v>

859
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.230
<v Speaker 2>the problem isn't the fact that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>

860
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.370
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system itself is fragile because of</v>

861
00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it was just them going out of</v>

862
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the fragile system has problems,</v>

863
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 2>when it has hiccups as it did in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

864
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's not just them going out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

865
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a generation of kids who leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>college with nothing waiting for them,</v>

866
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 2>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a job.</v>

867
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

868
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.660
<v Speaker 2>coming into a generation where their</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents could get by with one income and</v>

869
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:40.871
<v Speaker 2>a household and now three jobs each in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>household of two.</v>

870
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 2>And you can't afford to buy a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone a house.</v>

871
00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're part of the new sharing</v>

872
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does the sharing economy,</v>

873
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tone anything cause I can't afford</v>

874
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:54.611
<v Speaker 2>anything economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that whole generation is now</v>

875
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 2>suffering because of that fragility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system and the fragility hasn't gone</v>

876
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.740
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to dwell too much on</v>

877
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

878
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:09.821
<v Speaker 2>Because the thing that I find positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and interesting about bitcoin is that it</v>

879
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 2>serves a global society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is truly global,</v>

880
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 2>transnational money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of places in the world</v>

881
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 2>that have it worse than the u s there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some places that have it better</v>

882
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 2>financially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

883
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:27.140
<v Speaker 2>but it really is quite an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept to be able to have this money</v>

884
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:31.500
<v Speaker 2>that can operate on a global basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with that,</v>

885
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.530
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities to a buy and sell and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade and invest and borrow</v>

886
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 2>internationally.</v>

887
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.540
<v Speaker 2>The fact that what we did with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundraising here to fundraise for those</v>

888
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

889
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know if that was just people in</v>

890
00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:52.320
<v Speaker 2>the u s donating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

891
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I can guarantee you there were people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all over the world donating.</v>

892
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 2>That's almost impossible to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional payment systems.</v>

893
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 2>You could have then sent that money</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly to where the wells were being</v>

894
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:08.271
<v Speaker 2>built again anywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really exciting to me.</v>

895
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.430
<v Speaker 2>People are uncomfortable with bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's represents changing one of</v>

896
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental ancient technologies of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization money.</v>

897
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And we've only changed that technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five times in the history of</v>

898
00:45:25.591 --> 00:45:30.420
<v Speaker 2>human civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've gone from bare bones,</v>

899
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 2>barter systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a goat,</v>

900
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:37.341
<v Speaker 2>give me three chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to systems of precious metals</v>

901
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 2>and other nice objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feathers,</v>

902
00:45:42.871 --> 00:45:43.830
<v Speaker 2>shells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

903
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:45.960
<v Speaker 2>to exclusively precious metals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

904
00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Precious metal stamps with the faces of</v>
<v Speaker 2>kings.</v>

905
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.150
<v Speaker 2>And then at some point around the 15th</v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

906
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you start seeing certificates of deposit</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

907
00:45:57.201 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 2>for precious metal being exchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paper notes that I have a deposit of</v>

908
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 2>gold there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to move the gold from my</v>

909
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 2>deposit to your deposit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just give you the piece of paper</v>

910
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:11.301
<v Speaker 2>that says you're now the owner and paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>money is introduced and and then plastic</v>

911
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:16.790
<v Speaker 2>in the 1950s a diner's club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traveler's checks and the first credit</v>

912
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 2>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you think any of these</v>

913
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 2>transitions were smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them were smooth.</v>

914
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 2>You go to someone who's been using</v>
<v Speaker 2>precious metals for 10 generations and</v>

915
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:27.744
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

916
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.150
<v Speaker 2>this piece of paper is money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

917
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:36.810
<v Speaker 2>give me something shiny that I can bite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's money.</v>

918
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.060
<v Speaker 2>This paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are.</v>

919
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Go Away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long has that transition?</v>

920
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.570
<v Speaker 2>400 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

921
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Until broad acceptance of paper money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 years with huge resistance.</v>

922
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.830
<v Speaker 2>It took almost 40 years for credit cards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go mainstream with bitcoin.</v>

923
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.900
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do it probably in less</v>
<v Speaker 2>than 20 you think so?</v>

924
00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.630
<v Speaker 2>But in think cause almost 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's seven.</v>

925
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

926
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.700
<v Speaker 2>And it's accelerating very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some countries you're going</v>

927
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:10.701
<v Speaker 2>to see either bitcoin or cryptocurrency</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar or based on bitcoin be used</v>

928
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:17.150
<v Speaker 2>as commonly as a national currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not looking to displace national</v>

929
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 2>currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking to supplement them.</v>

930
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of being that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>will get comfortable using multiple</v>

931
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:27.360
<v Speaker 2>currencies just like many places they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

932
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.230
<v Speaker 2>If you're operating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

933
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the border of Kenya and Tanzania</v>

934
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to use four</v>

935
00:47:36.041 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 2>different currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenyan money,</v>

936
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania and US dollars in euros easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>

937
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Also South African rand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got four or five currencies.</v>

938
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.540
<v Speaker 2>You can stop at a four year old in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets and ask them what the exchange</v>

939
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 2>rate is and they'll tell you right?</v>

940
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Because they trade for their parents and</v>
<v Speaker 2>merchant stalls along the border and</v>

941
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:58.870
<v Speaker 2>they have people coming with all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different currencies.</v>

942
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not that difficult to assume that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's digital currencies in that</v>

943
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:06.940
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either there or in a major modern</v>

944
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:11.080
<v Speaker 2>metropolis where people are using</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin to transact online,</v>

945
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 2>to buy things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual things,</v>

946
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

947
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.950
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want to make very,</v>

948
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 2>very small payments were credit cards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not suitable and use bitcoin as well</v>

949
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 2>as their normal currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the progress that makes you so</v>

950
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:27.940
<v Speaker 2>optimistic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the,</v>

951
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe if you could point to any one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or several things that make you</v>

952
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 2>optimistic about Bitcoin's future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

953
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I think watching it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a computer scientist,</v>

954
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 2>as a technologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at this and I see innovation that</v>

955
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 2>is accelerating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see much of the early vision</v>

956
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:51.270
<v Speaker 2>opening up the possibility of doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are so far outside what we</v>

957
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 2>could do with traditional money.</v>

958
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

959
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.980
<v Speaker 2>it often blows my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

960
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.830
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

961
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that's being introduced into</v>

962
00:49:01.781 --> 00:49:04.190
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin now is called payment channels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

963
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.060
<v Speaker 2>and what it allows you to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

964
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.260
<v Speaker 2>to do a very high volume of very small</v>
<v Speaker 2>transactions at a very rapid rate.</v>

965
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to watch a video and you want</v>

966
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 2>to pay the owner of that video to send</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to you.</v>

967
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about paying by the second?</v>

968
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.760
<v Speaker 2>And so you say you set up basically an</v>
<v Speaker 2>account and you pay by every second of</v>

969
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:32.470
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe every fifth of a second,</v>

970
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 2>200 milliseconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video at a time,</v>

971
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and you're paying a fraction that is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousandth of a penny.</v>

972
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 2>And You keep watching video and paying a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousandth of a penny for every fifth of</v>

973
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 2>a second on this drip metered basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

974
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:49.510
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a computer.</v>

975
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Software is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating with our computer software</v>

976
00:49:52.751 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 2>and now you can do this really</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible thing.</v>

977
00:49:56.261 --> 00:49:58.960
<v Speaker 2>You can pay for content what it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually worth.</v>

978
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the thresholds for payments on a</v>

979
00:50:01.871 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 2>credit card is two to $3.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're apple and you're doing</v>

980
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:07.450
<v Speaker 2>billions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you can take it down to 99</v>

981
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about the lowest you can go.</v>

982
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:14.100
<v Speaker 2>So meaning watching something on youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some similar videos,</v>

983
00:50:14.101 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 2>streaming device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to pay service rather,</v>

984
00:50:17.561 --> 00:50:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would pay a very minuscule</v>

985
00:50:20.111 --> 00:50:20.944
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

986
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of cents like to watch a,</v>

987
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:25.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

988
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I literally mean a thousandth of 500th</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a cent to watch a video.</v>

989
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends how long the video is,</v>

990
00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

991
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

992
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it could be a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be a penny.</v>

993
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be a penny or half a penny or</v>

994
00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.980
<v Speaker 2>a 10th of a penny to watch a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

995
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 2>how would that work for the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are providing content?</v>

996
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

997
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is they operate at a scale.</v>

998
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

999
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 2>30,000 views on one of my videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1000
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 2>So Youtube pays me 30 bucks for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I put ads in front,</v>

1001
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 2>if I was getting a penny from each of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>customers,</v>

1002
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 2>or because these are like hour long</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

1003
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm going to charge more baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to charge 25 cents,</v>

1004
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,000 views,</v>

1005
00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:11.900
<v Speaker 2>25 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody do the math please.</v>

1006
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at selling himself,</v>

1007
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:15.034
<v Speaker 2>Matt Graham.</v>

1008
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like 70 bucks.</v>

1009
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:23.470
<v Speaker 2>$70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 cents is a quarter of a dollar.</v>

1010
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 7,000.</v>

1011
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:26.474
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.343
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1013
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:31.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's a rare time where I'm writing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>math fucking quick question like that.</v>

1014
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I'm going to charge less maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>

1015
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I can beat what youtube gives me in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of ad revenue with each customer</v>

1016
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>paying a fraction</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a penny.</v>

1017
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:50.000
<v Speaker 2>And here's the real question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get this content for free right</v>

1018
00:51:50.001 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 2>now on trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would I pay a fraction of a penny?</v>

1019
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.760
<v Speaker 2>You don't get it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're paying.</v>

1020
00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying him.</v>

1021
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And micro violations of your privacy.</v>

1022
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:04.460
<v Speaker 2>What's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the product costs less than two or $3</v>

1023
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:06.720
<v Speaker 2>making the stank face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1024
00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.510
<v Speaker 2>if agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was a weird way to word it.</v>

1025
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's at another cord,</v>

1026
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the payment is worth less than two or</v>

1027
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:15.520
<v Speaker 2>$3,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1028
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Which means they can't collect it with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit card.</v>

1029
00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is they're selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>your data to advertisers.</v>

1030
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 2>There are selling your identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your demographics,</v>

1031
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 2>your data to advertise a series here</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting,</v>

1032
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you're having to give up things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't give them up at that moment.</v>

1033
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 2>You've given them a previously when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>registered for the thing and verified</v>

1034
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:41.141
<v Speaker 2>your email and then verified your age</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your gender and provided all of this</v>

1035
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:45.740
<v Speaker 2>demographic information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they then parcel up and give to</v>

1036
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 2>the advertisers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still paying for the content.</v>

1037
00:52:49.101 --> 00:52:51.800
<v Speaker 2>What you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying by the fact that you can</v>

1038
00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:56.801
<v Speaker 2>no longer engage with the web without it</v>
<v Speaker 2>being filtered to what they think you</v>

1039
00:52:58.731 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 2>want and who they think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1040
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:06.370
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting this highly filtered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigeonholed view of content and they do</v>

1041
00:53:06.981 --> 00:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>that using your information to present</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think you would like to watch</v>

1042
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 2>based on what they've sold to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisers.</v>

1043
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:16.130
<v Speaker 2>You're no longer a customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the product.</v>

1044
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.280
<v Speaker 2>The customer is the advertising agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you sell content directly,</v>

1045
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>you reestablish the relationship of who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the creator</v>

1046
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 4>and who is the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consumer of this content,</v>

1047
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.250
<v Speaker 4>and you cut out the two middlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1048
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 4>you're cutting out advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

1049
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 4>And also the other thing is like people</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to pay,</v>

1050
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.070
<v Speaker 4>even if it's a fraction of a penny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't want to pay.</v>

1051
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.840
<v Speaker 4>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think of people,</v>

1052
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:44.820
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of dopes at watch youtube</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day.</v>

1053
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Speaker 4>Like they sit in front of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>

1054
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.370
<v Speaker 4>they slack jaw from morning to night and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just watch youtube videos.</v>

1055
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 4>If they just calculated those fractions</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a penny all day,</v>

1056
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 4>that would be dollars and dollars every</v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1057
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:58.710
<v Speaker 4>which would mean the hundreds of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 4>every few months.</v>

1058
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to think about this as a</v>

1059
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:05.991
<v Speaker 4>broader economy because a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people could also earn a bet by making</v>

1060
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:07.380
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good comment,</v>

1061
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which actually ends up covering some of</v>

1062
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:13.290
<v Speaker 4>their costs of viewing so that you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to think about it.</v>

1063
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 4>You can earn from comments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:17.200
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blockchain,</v>

1065
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 4>all this that you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1066
00:54:18.871 --> 00:54:21.180
<v Speaker 4>you could do this with bit coin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do this with blockchain.</v>

1067
00:54:21.181 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the difference in blockchain and</v>

1068
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:24.330
<v Speaker 4>Bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry to hijack that.</v>

1069
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.173
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>

1070
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so blockchain is one of the technologies</v>

1071
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 4>used in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a distributed database where,</v>

1072
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the transactions are linked</v>

1073
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.450
<v Speaker 4>together using cryptographic proofs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1074
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.240
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin is one implementation of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>blockchain.</v>

1075
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.970
<v Speaker 4>And blockchain has now been used as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>marketing term.</v>

1076
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.060
<v Speaker 4>That means very little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like web two.</v>

1077
00:54:45.061 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 4>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1078
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.460
<v Speaker 4>we don't really know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1079
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of hurry datto yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is blockchain.</v>

1081
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1082
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.100
<v Speaker 4>That's ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1083
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Hit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1084
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's nebulous.</v>

1085
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point is that you can do more</v>

1086
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 4>than just currency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1087
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 4>earlier we were talking a bit about</v>
<v Speaker 4>trolling on twitter and other platforms</v>

1088
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 4>like that before we started the live</v>
<v Speaker 4>broadcast.</v>

1089
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about what a troll is doing.</v>

1090
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:15.660
<v Speaker 4>What they're doing is they're stealing</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>

1091
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.540
<v Speaker 4>They're taking attention without</v>
<v Speaker 4>contributing anything back to the</v>

1092
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:19.790
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1093
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.780
<v Speaker 4>there's an interesting and fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1094
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:27.570
<v Speaker 4>effective market solution to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is instead of assigning someone to</v>

1095
00:55:27.571 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 4>do oversight and decide who is and who</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't a troll and censor them,</v>

1096
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:35.770
<v Speaker 4>you basically allow people to contribute</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1097
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 4>a minuscule fraction for the comments</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like,</v>

1098
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.140
<v Speaker 4>they [inaudible] power like thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with each one of those likes and</v>

1099
00:55:43.141 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 4>thumbs up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you attach a 10000th of a penny with it,</v>

1100
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>irrelevant,</v>

1101
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 4>small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny money.</v>

1102
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the people who write comments</v>

1103
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 4>that are broadly appreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that add value to the community or in a</v>

1104
00:55:57.781 --> 00:55:59.730
<v Speaker 4>tiny bit of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really anything serious,</v>

1105
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:03.360
<v Speaker 4>but if they tried to comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to spend a bit of that credit</v>

1106
00:56:03.361 --> 00:56:05.790
<v Speaker 4>that they've earned that reputation that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've earned.</v>

1107
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:09.210
<v Speaker 4>And if they're not a troll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

1108
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 4>it all comes out equal in the wash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't end up spending anything.</v>

1109
00:56:12.961 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 4>They don't end up burning anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just participation in the</v>

1110
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they're a troll is suddenly</v>

1111
00:56:16.951 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 4>starts getting interesting because now</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets expensive to steal the attention</v>

1112
00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:23.950
<v Speaker 4>to the community because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have</v>

1113
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.740
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more expensive it gets for you to po</v>

1114
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 2>post until eventually you're priced out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But does that also,</v>

1115
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 2>that also can kind of enforce or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or encourage confirmation bias because</v>

1116
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:41.200
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a website that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely ridiculous and it's a message</v>

1117
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 2>board filled with morons and you argue</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>

1118
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 2>it could cost you to argue with morons</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you're going to downvote you.</v>

1119
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1121
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:53.300
<v Speaker 2>and just choose to not comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could,</v>

1122
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.440
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think about this again</v>
<v Speaker 2>across a broader economy with a broader</v>

1123
00:56:57.441 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 2>set of forums in which in some you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>valued experts and other,</v>

1124
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:05.180
<v Speaker 2>you're the idiot who's arguing against</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conventional wisdom and,</v>

1125
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually balance these things</v>

1126
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to a flat earth forum and</v>

1127
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 2>argue with those people and it costs you</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1128
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an argument with someone about</v>

1129
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:17.230
<v Speaker 2>chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that go?</v>

1130
00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 2>It went really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went very,</v>

1131
00:57:19.691 --> 00:57:22.720
<v Speaker 2>very interestingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't expecting them to change their</v>

1132
00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:24.610
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1133
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 2>and they really wanted to hear my</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion and it was really interesting</v>

1134
00:57:29.111 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>because we started the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1135
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first I'm a pilot,</v>

1136
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I have a pilot's license,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fly small planes.</v>

1137
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:41.210
<v Speaker 2>That puts you at an extreme advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1138
00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:45.850
<v Speaker 2>This conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you think you would think that</v>

1139
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:46.731
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1140
00:57:46.731 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1141
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not appeal to authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's saying those nozzles that you're</v>

1142
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 2>pointing at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what those are.</v>

1143
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to walk around the plane before I</v>

1144
00:57:59.171 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 2>take off and make sure all of them have</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly attached in the place they</v>

1145
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:04.810
<v Speaker 2>should be doing the things they should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be doing.</v>

1146
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I don't survive the flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you are a part of the chem trail</v>

1147
00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>sprayers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>association of America,</v>

1148
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:12.940
<v Speaker 2>you're saying?</v>

1149
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty much the conclusion we</v>

1150
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:16.270
<v Speaker 2>reached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those nozzles?</v>

1151
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1152
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones pointing forward are called</v>

1153
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 2>peto tubes and they're used to measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>the velocity of the aircraft through the</v>

1154
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:30.790
<v Speaker 2>air by a pressure differential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ones pointing backwards are</v>

1155
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:35.230
<v Speaker 2>usually to break up of fortresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are little swirly currents of</v>

1156
00:58:35.231 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 2>arrows that come off the wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cause turbulence and you want to</v>

1157
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:41.190
<v Speaker 2>break those up so they don't swirl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1158
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.600
<v Speaker 2>by the weight of the trails are clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been a shell with a</v>

1159
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 2>water vapors government?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

1160
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Michelle.</v>

1161
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm Michelle for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't believe one of the things I'm</v>

1162
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut it off Jamie.</v>

1163
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had these conversations with so</v>

1164
00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:59.230
<v Speaker 2>frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can present mountains of evidence if</v>

1165
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:01.570
<v Speaker 2>someone really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really doesn't want to believe they,</v>

1166
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 2>they really will not believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>

1167
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's been going on forever.</v>

1168
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you go back to the 1940s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's pictures,</v>

1169
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 2>black and white photos from world war</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or World War II rather,</v>

1170
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.820
<v Speaker 2>where you can see planes leaving behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>these enormous controls.</v>

1171
00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's a argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1172
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've known for a long time that</v>

1173
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>depending upon how much moisture is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere,</v>

1174
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 1>when planes pass through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will create clouds.</v>

1175
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's just real simple changes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the air and it creates</v>

1176
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 1>clouds and it's usually on hazy days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

1177
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:42.341
<v Speaker 1>but NASA has a website where you can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and it will accurately predict.</v>

1178
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking through that.</v>

1179
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are from propeller engines in the</v>

1180
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 1>1940s and what's happening is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>propeller is compressing the air and</v>

1181
00:59:52.191 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 1>when it compresses the air of the change</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pressure changes the dewpoint and the</v>

1182
00:59:56.151 --> 01:00:01.151
<v Speaker 1>dewpoint is what determines whether the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air moisture condenses into a visible</v>

1183
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>vapor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into droplets that are clouds.</v>

1184
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And so by pushing a thing through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

1185
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pressing on the air and when you</v>

1186
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>press on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes condensation to form.</v>

1187
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And that conversation follows you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>circular cloud behind the plane.</v>

1188
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And this happens at any plane propeller</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

1189
01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I've done it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a four seater Cessna,</v>

1190
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's smaller than a,</v>

1191
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>than a Fiat sedan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1192
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

1193
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>on a wet day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see little trails coming off the</v>

1194
01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>tips of the wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I pretty short and put any spray</v>

1195
01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>nozzles they or flipped this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1196
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it said chem trail them and I</v>

1197
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't flip it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1198
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't how much liquid you would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have in your plane in order to spray</v>

1199
01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>these enormous jets across the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1200
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>it would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be insane.</v>

1201
01:00:56.901 --> 01:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the entire plane was filled up,</v>

1202
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean filled and you would have so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid that it would be visible from the</v>

1203
01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>ground floating in space.</v>

1204
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And then he talked to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1205
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I did that television show on Scifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called Joe Rogan questions,</v>

1206
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I questioned</v>

1207
01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>was chem trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to a bunch of chem trail,</v>

1208
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>air quote experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of these guys had this study</v>

1209
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>that he had done on water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this standing water study was</v>

1210
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>proving that the spraying in the air was</v>
<v Speaker 1>making aluminum.</v>

1211
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was putting aluminum in the water.</v>

1212
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>And the water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he had this water tested.</v>

1213
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed me the test,</v>

1214
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1215
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sludge.</v>

1216
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1217
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>it was water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave them water.</v>

1218
01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1219
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>but it says sludge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the laboratory that you sent this</v>

1220
01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>stuff too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says sludge.</v>

1221
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>

1222
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is exactly sludge?</v>

1223
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>What's the definition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1224
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's Google it.</v>

1225
01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So we googled sludge and what sludges is</v>
<v Speaker 1>water mixed with dirt?</v>

1226
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.061
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1227
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>so your water mixed with dirt contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>aluminum.</v>

1228
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much aluminum there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dirt?</v>

1229
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Because it's the exact amount that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested when they tested the world.</v>

1230
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>The water that you had with dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened is your dirt tested</v>

1231
01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:25.911
<v Speaker 1>positive for being dirt and you're using</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as proof that the government is</v>

1232
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>spraying the skies above everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1233
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.240
<v Speaker 1>And you want to talk about like a Piss</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor cost ineffective shitbag program</v>

1234
01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>that does absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chem Charles would be it because it's</v>

1235
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's getting sick.</v>

1236
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no lake rise in illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like mind control going on.</v>

1237
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things happening or is no mind</v>

1238
01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>control going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no mind control going on.</v>

1239
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>There is no mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1240
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>it's the dumbest fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It be easier to just put it in your</v>

1241
01:02:58.111 --> 01:02:59.630
<v Speaker 1>municipal water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1242
01:02:59.631 --> 01:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1243
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:02.280
<v Speaker 1>as arguments that are doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1244
01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1245
01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 1>They move it with a planes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>appliances are spraying.</v>

1246
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It drops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it falls in the water supply and then</v>

1247
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

1248
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.461
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1249
01:03:12.461 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Spreading themselves too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1250
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>But they're immune to it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>lizards.</v>

1251
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're down here too.</v>

1252
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So you spray the sky indiscriminately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1253
01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you some Illuminati is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or getting sprayed.</v>

1254
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get some hate mail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1255
01:03:23.881 --> 01:03:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I know it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1256
01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting it right now.</v>

1257
01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:30.450
<v Speaker 1>People were wiping the cheetos off their</v>
<v Speaker 1>greasy little fat fucking fingers right</v>

1258
01:03:30.451 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>now and hammering at the keyboards ready</v>
<v Speaker 1>to call a shills.</v>

1259
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the dumbest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what?</v>

1260
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1261
01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who runs,</v>

1262
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:41.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the website?</v>

1263
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunk metal,</v>

1264
01:03:42.811 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>bunk.com what is his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mick.</v>

1265

<v Speaker 1>They have to pay for a decade up front</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you leave,</v>

1289
01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:41.760

<v Speaker 1>Oh Gee.</v>

1290
01:04:41.761 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how it works.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And Joseph A.</v>

1293
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Meyer Junior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man behind the obscure Hedge Fund,</v>

1294
01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Al Our June lp is keeping his cards</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

1295
01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1296
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Invest most of his client's money in</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe treasury bonds.</v>

1297
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's safe as fuck.</v>

1298
01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>If you can't take your money out for 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1299
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in there can't take their</v>

1300
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>money out for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity.</v>

1301
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>That's insane that that's that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1302
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know this guy,</v>

1303
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>but look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1304
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>What does that all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

1305
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.690
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you had a gas,</v>

1306
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to,</v>

1307
01:05:22.171 --> 01:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I had to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you two options.</v>

1308
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legit or scam.</v>

1309
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1310
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it is most likely a Ponzi</v>

1311
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:36.040
<v Speaker 2>scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is outrageous.</v>

1312
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Something people throw around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the interesting thing is why</v>

1313
01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>do these schemes happen?</v>

1314
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you look as though it,</v>

1315
01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>his offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he offers an extraordinary guarantee</v>

1316
01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:50.040
<v Speaker 1>with our June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never lose my walk first as well.</v>

1317
01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:50.660
<v Speaker 1>What kind of names?</v>

1318
01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of an investment.</v>

1319
01:05:53.841 --> 01:05:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Fraud is guaranteed returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you make a guarantee like that,</v>

1320
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's usually one of the triggers that</v>

1321
01:06:00.951 --> 01:06:04.430
<v Speaker 2>gets people investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W he doesn't,</v>

1322
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:05.480
<v Speaker 2>but you never lose money.</v>

1323
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great investment.</v>

1324
01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investors should get involved.</v>

1325
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe put some bitcoin in that and to</v>

1326
01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.013
<v Speaker 1>solidify it.</v>

1327
01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1328
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you invest your money in Bitcoin,</v>

1329
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 2>you will lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1330
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 2>He will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will gain money.</v>

1331
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.800
<v Speaker 2>You will lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will gain money.</v>

1332
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:25.210
<v Speaker 2>He will lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1333
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the no one is an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want to be really careful about</v>

1334
01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:34.141
<v Speaker 2>this because many people go out and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>push the east things as investments and</v>

1335
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.760
<v Speaker 2>you can have a lot of volatility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when you have a lot of</v>

1336
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:41.830
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people get lucky and they make a</v>

1337
01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.970
<v Speaker 2>lot of money and some people are great</v>
<v Speaker 2>at picking their moment and they make</v>

1338
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:46.560
<v Speaker 2>some money</v>

1339
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>bailout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make a ton of money.</v>

1340
01:06:48.021 --> 01:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Like right now we're at 600 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bought it back when it was like,</v>

1341
01:06:51.231 --> 01:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest point?</v>

1342
01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lowest lowest points,</v>

1343
01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:56.760
<v Speaker 2>no slowest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1344
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.610
<v Speaker 2>about a thousandths of a dollar,</v>

1345
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of a dollar to two to 600.</v>

1346
01:07:02.541 --> 01:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You said it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1347
01:07:03.531 --> 01:07:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1348
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean if you put in like a fucking</v>

1349
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.830
<v Speaker 2>big pile of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1350
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Five grand and dip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took it out the wrong moment,</v>

1351
01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:16.470
<v Speaker 2>you would lose all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why this isn't,</v>

1352
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.880
<v Speaker 2>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1353
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 2>a speculative instruments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can speculate in it.</v>

1354
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.020
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

1355
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't the well kind of poisoned the</v>

1356
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 1>financial well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with speculative investing,</v>

1357
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are doing?</v>

1358
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it shouldn't be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really fucked up about it is</v>

1359
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing it with algorithms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're their gambling and they're</v>

1360
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're buying and selling within the</v>

1361
01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:45.400
<v Speaker 1>like a fraction of a second and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

1362
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:47.430
<v Speaker 1>The point where there was a radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1363
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:50.830
<v Speaker 1>podcasts where they talked about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment firms,</v>

1364
01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:52.320
<v Speaker 1>did you see that one or listen to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1365
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I have heard that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1366
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:58.260
<v Speaker 1>we're investment firms moved their</v>
<v Speaker 1>servers closer to the exchange so that</v>

1367
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:04.240
<v Speaker 1>he'd get in there their orders and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange is quicker.</v>

1368
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>There is small on New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are the data centers of the,</v>

1369
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.810
<v Speaker 2>none of the stock trading happens in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan.</v>

1370
01:08:09.811 --> 01:08:14.070
<v Speaker 2>It happens across the water in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey as a data center,</v>

1371
01:08:14.071 --> 01:08:19.071
<v Speaker 2>there were probably largest amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money moves ever and they have measured</v>

1372
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 2>runs of fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that in order to be fair,</v>

1373
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:26.420
<v Speaker 2>the fiber optic cable between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>service that do the trading and every</v>

1374
01:08:26.421 --> 01:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the rocks that are in the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>are measured to be the equal length so</v>

1375
01:08:30.771 --> 01:08:35.771
<v Speaker 2>that the speed of light limitation</v>
<v Speaker 2>across a room of a hundred feet does not</v>

1376
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.980
<v Speaker 2>advantage one customer over another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that incredible?</v>

1377
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>We're talking microseconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1378
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:43.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1380
01:08:43.501 --> 01:08:46.260
<v Speaker 1>if people have been forced because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1381
01:08:46.261 --> 01:08:51.261
<v Speaker 1>to move their offices from the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country where they were two right</v>

1382
01:08:51.781 --> 01:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>there or rent space where their servers</v>
<v Speaker 1>are right there.</v>

1383
01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bizarre because a lot of this</v>

1384
01:08:58.471 --> 01:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff is actually done with computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these computers are operating on an</v>

1385
01:09:01.711 --> 01:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The algorithms recognize patterns.</v>

1386
01:09:03.991 --> 01:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>They start these exchanges and they buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sell and buy and sell and buy and</v>

1387
01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>sell and do all of this within fractions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a second.</v>

1388
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over the last decade,</v>

1389
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 2>most trading floors have seen 90% of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their traders disappear.</v>

1390
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So there are empty rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see photos,</v>

1391
01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:21.860
<v Speaker 2>all that's online where it shows before</v>
<v Speaker 2>and after photos of very big banks like</v>

1392
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 2>ubs and jp Morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goldman Sachs,</v>

1393
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.980
<v Speaker 2>companies like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you see their trading floor and it</v>

1394
01:09:27.981 --> 01:09:32.981
<v Speaker 2>is empty because a lot of that has now</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to algorithmic trading.</v>

1395
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 2>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a weird,</v>

1396
01:09:35.751 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 2>weird way to invest in bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh thank you.</v>

1397
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1398
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:42.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the before and after and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're making less money,</v>

1399
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a downturn.</v>

1400
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:47.780
<v Speaker 2>This during this time they've actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>made more money.</v>

1401
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about those stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange videos that were in movies,</v>

1402
01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you know by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Sal,</v>

1403
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Sal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've got their hands up and</v>

1404
01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:58.070
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want two of these and five of these</v>

1405
01:09:58.071 --> 01:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>and they're holding up pieces of paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so daunting.</v>

1406
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:06.020
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is so confusing to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person on the outside looking at that</v>

1407
01:10:06.021 --> 01:10:08.180
<v Speaker 1>and trying to figure out what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are doing.</v>

1408
01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems exciting and chaotic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrant but so confusing.</v>

1409
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is,</v>

1410
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.890
<v Speaker 2>that is the American economy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

1411
01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.020
<v Speaker 2>It's based on confidence all that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1412
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So should we talk about a slightly</v>

1413
01:10:27.091 --> 01:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>different topic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1414
01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you about some of the new</v>

1415
01:10:31.441 --> 01:10:33.120
<v Speaker 2>developments that are happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin,</v>

1416
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.390
<v Speaker 2>which I find interesting and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to show,</v>

1417
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>cause this is not really about a company</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a specific product,</v>

1418
01:10:39.841 --> 01:10:43.110
<v Speaker 2>but I want to talk about one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that has me excited,</v>

1419
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.930
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1420
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you combine a</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that looks very much like</v>

1421
01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:55.551
<v Speaker 2>pure to pure napster or bittorrent with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a merchant service like he bay and you</v>

1422
01:10:58.051 --> 01:11:02.520
<v Speaker 2>create this hybrid technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a completely peer to peer,</v>

1423
01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:06.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>store service called open bazaar.</v>

1424
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:10.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is basically a system where you</v>

1425
01:11:10.501 --> 01:11:12.960
<v Speaker 2>run on your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some software,</v>

1426
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:18.620
<v Speaker 2>and you can open a store to delivery the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical goods or virtual goods,</v>

1427
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.550
<v Speaker 2>have them listed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them found by others,</v>

1428
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>and then all of the payments are done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

1429
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So by decentralizing the payment system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can also decentralize the the store</v>

1430
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:38.781
<v Speaker 2>system completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is a completely borderless</v>

1431
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>multinational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1432
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:46.610
<v Speaker 2>open and peer to peer opensource</v>
<v Speaker 2>software merchant system running on top</v>

1433
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 2>of Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just find fascinating.</v>

1434
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.830
<v Speaker 2>The ability for anyone to open a store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in countries where you don't</v>

1435
01:11:55.831 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 2>have Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1436
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.490
<v Speaker 2>And be able to sell goods and services</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world and receive</v>

1437
01:12:02.491 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 2>payments in Bitcoin and does this</v>
<v Speaker 2>operational right now?</v>

1438
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm selling that book,</v>

1439
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Openbazaar.</v>

1440
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:14.280
<v Speaker 2>So how does one access openbazaar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1441
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.190
<v Speaker 2>to the Luddite?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1442
01:12:16.191 --> 01:12:19.200
<v Speaker 2>they run software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fees,</v>

1443
01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 2>no restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they downloads the software,</v>

1444
01:12:22.261 --> 01:12:26.070
<v Speaker 2>run it on their computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funded the bitcoin wallets and which</v>

1445
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:28.170
<v Speaker 2>sits on their computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to give their money.</v>

1446
01:12:28.171 --> 01:12:30.780
<v Speaker 2>21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no intermediaries and you buy</v>

1447
01:12:30.781 --> 01:12:35.130
<v Speaker 2>directly from the store and the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>running the store is running the same</v>

1448
01:12:35.131 --> 01:12:35.700
<v Speaker 2>software.</v>

1449
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what some of the things that</v>

1450
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:39.660
<v Speaker 2>they have available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to openbazaar.org.</v>

1451
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.030
<v Speaker 2>I have to download the programs and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>find another way to look at it.</v>

1452
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to do duo search is a search</v>

1453
01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 2>engine on top a d u o s e a r.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

1454
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:52.614
<v Speaker 2>C.</v>
<v Speaker 2>H.</v>

1455
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:55.130
<v Speaker 2>So duo search.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1456
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 2>So because this is an open protocol and</v>
<v Speaker 2>because all of the listings are in a</v>

1457
01:12:59.521 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>peer to peer network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just go online.</v>

1458
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I run a search engine and create a</v>
<v Speaker 2>search engine that searches the store.</v>

1459
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a third party that just has a s</v>

1460
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 2>a search engine for searching the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can um,</v>

1461
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:17.280
<v Speaker 2>you can search online there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell her what you're looking for and</v>

1462
01:13:17.281 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 2>find something from tee shirts to gary</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

1463
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you can find my bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1464
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what I wanted to show.</v>

1465
01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy a flip phone,</v>

1466
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:27.600
<v Speaker 2>go back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get a phone for Ari.</v>

1467
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these darks are going to flip</v>

1468
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:35.310
<v Speaker 2>phones now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 Bucks for a Cryo Sarah,</v>

1469
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.880
<v Speaker 2>or that's an LG LG 44.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind.</v>

1470
01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Damn bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about going flip</v>

1471
01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me?</v>

1472
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1473
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the opposite category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't actually received a phone call</v>

1474
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 2>on my phone probably in three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really it's not,</v>

1475
01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a phone I had out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a portable computer,</v>

1476
01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 2>which also has a phone function on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I keep switched off.</v>

1477
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.490
<v Speaker 2>You keep it off pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bring ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't rain boot on my ring attached</v>

1479
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people text you?</v>

1480
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1481
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:11.100
<v Speaker 2>but that actually gets redirected to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>email.</v>

1482
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 2>So I don't do texts.</v>

1483
01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.470
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it through either hangouts or</v>

1484
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 4>email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I send you a text,</v>

1485
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really go to you as a text.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1486
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.570
<v Speaker 4>it comes through to Google hangouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are one of the weirdest guys have</v>

1487
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.100
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1488
01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 4>I use it as a portable computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my communicator device.</v>

1489
01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:28.450
<v Speaker 4>The phone function is irrelevant to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1490
01:14:28.451 --> 01:14:30.220
<v Speaker 4>don't you ever want to talk to people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you go,</v>

1491
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you doing?</v>

1492
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do video talks most of the time I know</v>

1493
01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1494
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I talk to people,</v>

1495
01:14:37.151 --> 01:14:37.890
<v Speaker 4>it's on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1496
01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.930
<v Speaker 4>they're selling cbd oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>CBD oil,</v>

1497
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 4>organic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pure,</v>

1498
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:43.310
<v Speaker 4>raw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>natural CBDC.</v>

1499
01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 4>That is where the damn government's</v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna come in and close this whole thing</v>

1500
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:49.020
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you guys doing?</v>

1501
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:51.130
<v Speaker 4>Mitigating pain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pieces of shit.</v>

1502
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 4>We're going to come in with dogs and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bite you.</v>

1503
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're probably actually only selling</v>

1504
01:14:57.371 --> 01:15:01.930
<v Speaker 4>that's within Oregon within a</v>
<v Speaker 4>jurisdiction where it's legal,</v>

1505
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they can sell it within that</v>

1506
01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:06.430
<v Speaker 4>jurisdiction from that jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's perfectly legal to sell</v>

1507
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.940
<v Speaker 4>Colorado to clarify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's growing and getting in.</v>

1508
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.770
<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about how weird you are.</v>

1509
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 4>He showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1510
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 4>Andrea has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a apple laptop and I was like,</v>

1511
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 4>how dare you walk in here with an apple</v>
<v Speaker 4>product?</v>

1512
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 4>I expect you to have some Linux box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course he's running linux on his</v>

1513
01:15:22.691 --> 01:15:23.650
<v Speaker 4>apple computer.</v>

1514
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:26.091
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1515
01:15:26.091 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm also running Linux.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm running a bunch of things,</v>

1516
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a beautiful piece of hardware.</v>

1517
01:15:30.371 --> 01:15:33.070
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that like everything</v>

1518
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 4>else the company does or you just don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the restrictive aspects of it,</v>

1519
01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:36.964
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1520
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're all android,</v>

1521
01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:39.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1522
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 4>I am on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you using now?</v>

1523
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Which I have a nexus five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1524
01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:45.611
<v Speaker 4>that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1525
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:49.090
<v Speaker 4>so this is the newest and the latest</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest of the Google phones.</v>

1526
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:51.760
<v Speaker 4>So it runs the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pure google or did you,</v>

1527
01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.531
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1528
01:15:52.531 --> 01:15:53.980
<v Speaker 4>it's no carrier branding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1529
01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:55.750
<v Speaker 4>I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I own the phone.</v>

1530
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:59.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not a lease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1531
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the newest,</v>

1532
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:04.930
<v Speaker 4>latest and greatest android phones or at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the very least commensurate with the</v>

1533
01:16:04.931 --> 01:16:09.220
<v Speaker 4>newest and latest and greatest iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

1534
01:16:09.221 --> 01:16:12.000
<v Speaker 4>it's the average person that slight</v>
<v Speaker 4>differences in,</v>

1535
01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.560
<v Speaker 4>in hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1536
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.280
<v Speaker 4>really are irrelevant at this point.</v>

1537
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 4>It's wall to wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does matter.</v>

1538
01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:19.780
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his watch you can and can't do with the</v>

1539
01:16:19.781 --> 01:16:23.830
<v Speaker 4>software and how much of your life at</v>
<v Speaker 4>controls and how much privacy you have</v>

1540
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.280
<v Speaker 4>with the software that you run on these</v>
<v Speaker 4>devices.</v>

1541
01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:30.730
<v Speaker 4>As you may have noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all about control and privacy.</v>

1542
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Being able to control my money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>control my devices,</v>

1543
01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 4>control my privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1544
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that should be a principle that we</v>

1545
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:44.590
<v Speaker 4>should all celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fundamental freedom and we're</v>

1546
01:16:44.591 --> 01:16:46.480
<v Speaker 4>gradually losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1547
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:51.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of options as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm happy that a android's come along</v>

1548
01:16:51.251 --> 01:16:52.840
<v Speaker 4>and created options.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1549
01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.520
<v Speaker 4>Because it was for a long time it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1550
01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:55.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an option,</v>

1551
01:16:55.691 --> 01:16:57.010
<v Speaker 4>but it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1552
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 4>And now it's not just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1553
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 4>the Galaxy s seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever messed with that Samsung</v>

1554
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:05.210
<v Speaker 4>Galaxy s seven and I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1555
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a phenomenal phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1556
01:17:06.761 --> 01:17:08.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is easily as good as an</v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone.</v>

1557
01:17:08.741 --> 01:17:09.760
<v Speaker 4>It's an phone</v>

1558
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 2>and throw it into a gear vr headsets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get fully immersive vr.</v>

1559
01:17:15.241 --> 01:17:16.900
<v Speaker 2>That is mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1560
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:20.910
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a little headset that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can put this phone into and to Vr,</v>

1561
01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that stuff's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as good as the htc vive.</v>

1562
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Duncan Duncan trussell as the</v>

1563
01:17:27.561 --> 01:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>vibe.</v>

1564
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I also paid $30 for my headset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1565
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said the five is what,</v>

1566
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.903
<v Speaker 2>1200?</v>

1567
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It's probably something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a slight difference in price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1569
01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.740
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>

1570
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

1571
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 1>it's very encouraging that not only is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there a competitor to apple,</v>

1572
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.320
<v Speaker 1>but it is actually an equal now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1573
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and I just think the more options people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like that,</v>

1574
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the better there are for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be nice if there was a</v>

1575
01:17:53.931 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 1>commensurate operating system because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really,</v>

1576
01:17:57.610 --> 01:17:58.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1577
01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.770
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1578
01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.810
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Geek heads like me,</v>

1579
01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:04.420
<v Speaker 2>it's letting x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But essentially what happened is because</v>

1580
01:18:04.421 --> 01:18:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Lennox was so successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became android.</v>

1581
01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Android was built on top of Linux.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

1582
01:18:10.271 --> 01:18:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at its very core,</v>

1583
01:18:11.981 --> 01:18:13.210
<v Speaker 2>it is Linux.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1584
01:18:13.211 --> 01:18:14.500
<v Speaker 2>But why don't they make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1585
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.140
<v Speaker 2>that kind of an operating system for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

1586
01:18:17.141 --> 01:18:18.370
<v Speaker 2>for a laptop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1587
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:20.380
<v Speaker 2>because from what I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1588
01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:25.300
<v Speaker 2>laptops are gradually disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laptop market is disappearing</v>

1589
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:26.500
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

1590
01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today there were some announcements from</v>

1591
01:18:28.841 --> 01:18:32.260
<v Speaker 2>apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're changing some of their operating</v>

1592
01:18:32.261 --> 01:18:35.230
<v Speaker 2>system commitments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're making the m seven.</v>

1593
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making the operating system more</v>

1594
01:18:37.331 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 2>and more like Ios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1595
01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.840
<v Speaker 2>and gradually diminishing the importance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1596
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:47.950
<v Speaker 2>of laptops because most people do pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much everything they need to do on their</v>

1597
01:18:47.951 --> 01:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>smartphones nowadays.</v>

1598
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a difference that it's nice</v>

1599
01:18:53.551 --> 01:18:56.120
<v Speaker 1>that I can take my phone with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

1600
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:58.200
<v Speaker 1>the larger iphone that I use most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1601
01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:00.370
<v Speaker 1>and I also have a Samsung phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll,</v>

1602
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>the larger iphone that I use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time I can take with me and</v>

1603
01:19:03.061 --> 01:19:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I'm missing a laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I need to work on it,</v>

1604
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.870
<v Speaker 1>get some stuff done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a laptop.</v>

1605
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

1606
01:19:12.241 --> 01:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>if I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially I want to be able to work.</v>

1607
01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1608
01:19:15.601 --> 01:19:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to also plug in</v>
<v Speaker 1>headsets and listen to music while I'm</v>

1609
01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.180
<v Speaker 1>working and also have power at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1610
01:19:21.181 --> 01:19:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And it says a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1611
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of actual computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like an actual computer at home with a</v>

1612
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.510
<v Speaker 1>detached keyboard and a real monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1613
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I just think those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some benefits of those things to</v>

1614
01:19:34.401 --> 01:19:36.240
<v Speaker 1>someone who writes in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1615
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the great American novel is</v>

1616
01:19:38.501 --> 01:19:40.840
<v Speaker 2>being written by thumbs right now?</v>

1617
01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Wright was writing a whole book</v>

1618
01:19:43.141 --> 01:19:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was writing a novel in tweets that</v>

1620
01:19:47.751 --> 01:19:50.830
<v Speaker 1>got typed on a real keyboard for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>

1621
01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I ended up money where for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are listening.</v>

1622
01:19:53.670 --> 01:19:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what else is exciting for you right</v>

1623
01:19:57.331 --> 01:19:58.290
<v Speaker 1>now about</v>

1624
01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.360
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think one of the things we've seen</v>

1625
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:06.361
<v Speaker 2>that that has been quite interesting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it has become easier and easier and</v>

1626
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:11.730
<v Speaker 2>easier to use and easier to get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and easier to use bitcoin in</v>

1627
01:20:11.731 --> 01:20:15.300
<v Speaker 2>your everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a time when it was very,</v>

1628
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:17.280
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to do all of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1629
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Now there are probably six or 700</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanges around the world.</v>

1630
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about Mt.</v>

1631
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Gox in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first bitcoin exchange,</v>

1632
01:20:27.271 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 2>the really the first major bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange.</v>

1633
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>At the time it was the exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were no others,</v>

1634
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was both a single point of failure</v>

1635
01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:40.950
<v Speaker 2>and a weakness for bit coin as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>proved.</v>

1636
01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also made it very difficult.</v>

1637
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Now there are at least four or five</v>
<v Speaker 2>major exchanges operating in the US,</v>

1638
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.510
<v Speaker 2>very easy to access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1639
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.420
<v Speaker 2>access the system to connect it to maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a bank account or a debit card.</v>

1640
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to convert dollars to</v>

1641
01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin or Bitcoin to dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1642
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I earn bitcoin and then I converted into</v>

1643
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:10.290
<v Speaker 2>dollars to pay for things that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay in bitcoin.</v>

1644
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Very easy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a major advancement that makes it</v>

1645
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 2>much easier for people to get involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as they want.</v>

1646
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to earn everything they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to do.</v>

1647
01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:27.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called bit wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which allows you to take a percentage of</v>

1648
01:21:28.411 --> 01:21:32.220
<v Speaker 2>your paycheck and have it sent to you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin.</v>

1649
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very easy for an employer to</v>

1650
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:37.920
<v Speaker 2>set it up with any of the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 2>payroll systems where they say,</v>

1651
01:21:37.921 --> 01:21:38.970
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1652
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:44.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put 2% of my account into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings account in 98% into my checking</v>

1653
01:21:45.691 --> 01:21:47.250
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of companies offer that.</v>

1654
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Well now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also want to put 2% of my paycheck</v>

1655
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:54.960
<v Speaker 2>every month into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to the employer,</v>

1656
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a routing number and</v>
<v Speaker 2>account number,</v>

1657
01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 2>but on the other end it gets converted</v>
<v Speaker 2>into bitcoin and send to your bitcoin</v>

1658
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 2>wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can very easily incorporate this</v>

1659
01:22:04.891 --> 01:22:08.850
<v Speaker 2>as part of your everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's another thing.</v>

1660
01:22:08.851 --> 01:22:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try and show this in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't cause me a big problem with</v>

1661
01:22:12.031 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 2>my finances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how it had caused you a big problem</v>

1662
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:18.210
<v Speaker 2>if someone sees something to show the</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit card number.</v>

1663
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1664
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't Super Crypto</v>

1665
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.950
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bitcoin debit card and basically</v>

1666
01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 2>it operates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the exchanges in the u s offers</v>

1667
01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:37.701
<v Speaker 2>this and there's actually two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the u s that now offer this kind of</v>

1668
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>

1669
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Now what's behind this is a bit coin</v>
<v Speaker 2>wallet.</v>

1670
01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:45.270
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have dollars in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have bitcoin in this,</v>

1671
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:49.920
<v Speaker 2>but when I went to the coffee shop or I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got this coffee earlier today,</v>

1672
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I swiped this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1673
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.410
<v Speaker 2>do they look at you sideways?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1674
01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they see a visa card.</v>

1675
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It says visa on the front says debit</v>
<v Speaker 2>visa.</v>

1676
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:02.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say bitcoin anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1677
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.270
<v Speaker 2>and so I make a payment and I get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little message on my phone that says</v>

1678
01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:12.540
<v Speaker 2>we've debited 0.0002 bitcoin from your</v>
<v Speaker 2>account for your purchase at the coffee</v>

1679
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.400
<v Speaker 2>shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could even tip them in bitcoin.</v>

1680
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1681
01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:18.850
<v Speaker 2>here's where it gets interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1682
01:23:18.851 --> 01:23:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I travel all around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do these talks and these conferences.</v>

1683
01:23:21.881 --> 01:23:25.000
<v Speaker 2>So I'm constantly on the road and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried again and again with my bank</v>

1684
01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:26.200
<v Speaker 2>account to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1685
01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.453
<v Speaker 2>I travel.</v>

1686
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>When are you traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>

1687
01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you traveling next?</v>

1688
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh 16 different countries in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven months.</v>

1689
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:39.310
<v Speaker 2>Can you just put a note somewhere on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>account that says do not block his visa</v>

1690
01:23:39.311 --> 01:23:43.000
<v Speaker 2>if it shows up somewhere we don't expect</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this person travels.</v>

1691
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 2>American Express can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Bank cat,</v>

1692
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:50.560
<v Speaker 2>they simply can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want me 24 hours before I leave to</v>

1693
01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:55.030
<v Speaker 2>call them and give them specific lists</v>
<v Speaker 2>of places that I'm going to be and when</v>

1694
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I tried to use my card,</v>

1695
01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:02.610
<v Speaker 2>it gets blocked until I come back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>u s and talk to them on the phone and</v>

1696
01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 2>try a whole bunch of questions about</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was really me who bought,</v>

1697
01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pastry in Prague or something like</v>

1698
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:13.540
<v Speaker 2>that and then that all block it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's happened to repeatedly in the</v>

1699
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 2>last few months is I'll go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my card will get blocked because I</v>

1700
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:19.570
<v Speaker 2>forgot to tell them and then I'll pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the bitcoin card and it works</v>

1701
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.600
<v Speaker 2>everywhere without fail because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepaid because it's a debit everywhere</v>

1702
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:25.690
<v Speaker 2>without fail.</v>

1703
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:28.030
<v Speaker 2>If I need to move more money into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I need to take money,</v>

1704
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:32.230
<v Speaker 2>cash out of an ATM when I'm traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can use this and it's so much easier.</v>

1705
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I can simply transfer bitcoin into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>account and 10 minutes later I can</v>

1706
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:40.780
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in cash in any currency in any</v>

1707
01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:43.150
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say that with such glee,</v>

1708
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:46.220
<v Speaker 2>it's convenience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so excited about it.</v>

1709
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1710
01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get excited about these things because</v>

1711
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:54.130
<v Speaker 2>it makes it easy for me to use Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1712
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's visa,</v>

1713
01:24:57.010 --> 01:24:58.840
<v Speaker 2>the evil empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the banking system,</v>

1714
01:24:58.841 --> 01:24:59.501
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1715
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:03.730
<v Speaker 2>But for many people who are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience bitcoin as an additional</v>

1716
01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:06.370
<v Speaker 2>currency in their life when they use for</v>
<v Speaker 2>online purchases,</v>

1717
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:11.550
<v Speaker 2>having the flexibility to use both and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it easier and more transparent is</v>

1718
01:25:11.711 --> 01:25:14.800
<v Speaker 2>how you get to mainstream adoption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the developed world.</v>

1719
01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would someone get ahold of one of</v>

1720
01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 2>those cards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they just opened an account with</v>

1721
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 2>an exchange?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to do all of the Patriot Act,</v>

1722
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Bank Secrecy Act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me ID,</v>

1723
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.600
<v Speaker 2>proof of residence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1724
01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the end they get a visa card.</v>

1725
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:33.610
<v Speaker 2>And what exchanges are available for</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting visa debit cards like that.</v>

1726
01:25:33.611 --> 01:25:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Like can you name some?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1727
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the U s coinbase,</v>

1728
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:43.980
<v Speaker 2>coinbase.com and Bitpay bitpay.com both</v>
<v Speaker 2>offer a visa debit cards in many</v>

1729
01:25:45.701 --> 01:25:50.701
<v Speaker 2>countries around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zappo x a p o offer a debit card and</v>

1730
01:25:51.551 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of others.</v>

1731
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1732
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually very promising because</v>

1733
01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 2>that makes it practical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1734
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's one side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a few other things that have</v>

1735
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:04.790
<v Speaker 2>happened in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly we have seen,</v>

1736
01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:07.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the banking industry realized</v>

1737
01:26:07.901 --> 01:26:10.550
<v Speaker 2>that they could actually use this</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

1738
01:26:10.690 --> 01:26:12.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just fear it.</v>

1739
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this and I certainly bring this</v>

1740
01:26:17.901 --> 01:26:20.820
<v Speaker 2>view of banks as giants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cara couture,</v>

1741
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.300
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur evil things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within them,</v>

1742
01:26:23.301 --> 01:26:24.760
<v Speaker 2>there's just normal people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1743
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Swept up in the institutional inertia of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this beast.</v>

1744
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:30.020
<v Speaker 2>But there's people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1745
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.430
<v Speaker 2>some of them get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get the,</v>

1746
01:26:32.431 --> 01:26:35.060
<v Speaker 2>this is exciting and interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disruptive.</v>

1747
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.660
<v Speaker 2>They want to use it within the banking</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and they're trying to work from</v>

1748
01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:43.661
<v Speaker 2>within to get people interested in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're seeing more and more of these</v>

1749
01:26:45.141 --> 01:26:50.141
<v Speaker 2>organizations gradually try to find ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adopt this technology to streamline</v>

1750
01:26:51.111 --> 01:26:56.111
<v Speaker 2>and to improve banking itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very similar to what we saw in</v>

1751
01:26:57.591 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties when the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>started happening much more mainstream.</v>

1752
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:05.000
<v Speaker 2>The phone companies at first fought it</v>
<v Speaker 2>tooth and nail,</v>

1753
01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:07.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fought the service providers tried</v>

1754
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:12.650
<v Speaker 2>not to give them access to their lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try not to kick them off the DSL</v>

1755
01:27:12.651 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 2>networks at the time.</v>

1756
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fall to the FCC,</v>

1757
01:27:16.401 --> 01:27:21.401
<v Speaker 2>they tried to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually they all became ISB,</v>

1758
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So eventually jumped on the bandwagon</v>

1759
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.370
<v Speaker 2>and use it to improve their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure.</v>

1760
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Now if you make a phone call on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular traditional old phone,</v>

1761
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.460
<v Speaker 2>your phone call is going over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

1762
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:39.700
<v Speaker 2>almost 90% sure that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wouldn't let the Internet beyond</v>

1763
01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:40.671
<v Speaker 2>the phone network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1764
01:27:40.671 --> 01:27:42.590
<v Speaker 2>the entire phone network is on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

1765
01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.710
<v Speaker 2>If flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's called infrastructure in version.</v>

1766
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early days of the automobile,</v>

1767
01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:53.681
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't let automobiles in towns</v>
<v Speaker 2>too because they would disrupt the horse</v>

1768
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:55.520
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1769
01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.120
<v Speaker 2>And they had all kinds of weird laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including in the UK.</v>

1770
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 2>They passed the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which required someone to run ahead of</v>

1771
01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 2>the car with a red flag I call the Red</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flag Act.</v>

1772
01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:07.520
<v Speaker 2>That did wonders for the British</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automobile Industry,</v>

1773
01:28:07.521 --> 01:28:10.220
<v Speaker 2>which was 20 years ahead at the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then wasn't,</v>

1774
01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1775
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.370
<v Speaker 2>That kind of reactionary behavior is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common in new technologies.</v>

1776
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And then infrastructure inversion</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens eventually.</v>

1777
01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.580
<v Speaker 2>The thing that was considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible,</v>

1778
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 2>the roads would be paved to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>automobile travel practical everywhere</v>

1779
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:31.490
<v Speaker 2>happened and horses were quite happy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ride on paved roads.</v>

1780
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for automobiles,</v>

1781
01:28:33.711 --> 01:28:38.711
<v Speaker 2>it was almost impossible to use in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rutted muddy road when you have a four</v>

1782
01:28:40.921 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 2>wheel drive vehicle trying to compete</v>
<v Speaker 2>against a four [inaudible] drive</v>

1783
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.530
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:50.960
<v Speaker 2>And in those early days they pointed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>

1785
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.670
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is never going to work.</v>

1786
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Automobiles and never going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have the</v>

1787
01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:58.310
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have the need infrastructure</v>

1788
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:00.920
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've seen that with the automobile,</v>

1789
01:29:00.921 --> 01:29:03.210
<v Speaker 2>we that with electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen that with the Internet.</v>

1790
01:29:03.211 --> 01:29:06.570
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that with all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies and now we're going to see</v>

1791
01:29:06.571 --> 01:29:10.320
<v Speaker 2>it again with money because if you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>this technology,</v>

1792
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>building the banking institutions on top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this is easy,</v>

1793
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 2>but making bitcoin or other</v>
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrencies,</v>

1794
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 2>making the Internet of money play by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules of the old banking system is</v>

1795
01:29:22.831 --> 01:29:23.664
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible.</v>

1796
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that expression,</v>

1797
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:31.790
<v Speaker 2>crypto currency and crypto currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the stop banks from creating</v>

1798
01:29:33.271 --> 01:29:38.271
<v Speaker 2>their own crypto currency and what mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is so wonderful about bitcoin in</v>

1799
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 2>comparison to other cryptocurrencies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1800
01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:45.120
<v Speaker 2>that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to stop them.</v>

1801
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.660
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already doing it are.</v>

1802
01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1803
01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:52.440
<v Speaker 2>you've got to realize there's more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand cryptocurrencies already.</v>

1804
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:53.700
<v Speaker 2>1,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1805
01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:56.150
<v Speaker 2>More than a thousand cups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst one was the one.</v>

1806
01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:59.340
<v Speaker 2>We should avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That list is almost 900 long.</v>

1807
01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1808
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long tail.</v>

1809
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1810
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:08.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple that are interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>that offer different perspectives.</v>

1811
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

1812
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:13.650
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing a lot of private</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions interested in creating</v>

1813
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.930
<v Speaker 2>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1814
01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 2>and there's nothing stopping them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

1815
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 2>but they have to make a fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

1816
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:23.700
<v Speaker 2>They can either create some things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is controlled,</v>

1817
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.090
<v Speaker 2>contained with specific outlines and</v>
<v Speaker 2>borders,</v>

1818
01:30:27.091 --> 01:30:30.180
<v Speaker 2>with controlled access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>permissioned access,</v>

1819
01:30:30.181 --> 01:30:31.050
<v Speaker 2>as they would call it.</v>

1820
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that by definition is not global.</v>

1821
01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.770
<v Speaker 2>It can't be global.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be contained within a specific</v>

1822
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction because that's how they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they operate.</v>

1823
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Both corporations and banks operate</v>
<v Speaker 2>within specific jurisdictions,</v>

1824
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 2>so they can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1825
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:52.170
<v Speaker 2>but then it has to be close to two</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation,</v>

1826
01:30:52.171 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 2>close to permission and not global and</v>
<v Speaker 2>transnational.</v>

1827
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 2>And so what bitcoin has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just bitcoin,</v>

1828
01:30:58.741 --> 01:31:03.741
<v Speaker 2>but any public open currency of a global</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature like Bitcoin,</v>

1829
01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.590
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't need to ask permission</v>
<v Speaker 2>to join.</v>

1830
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to ask permission to</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovate.</v>

1831
01:31:09.691 --> 01:31:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to ask permission to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a new application and any</v>

1832
01:31:13.681 --> 01:31:14.760
<v Speaker 2>application,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

1833
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:18.960
<v Speaker 2>we'll instantaneously work anywhere in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to anyone without permission.</v>

1834
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:23.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the magic of bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about it,</v>

1835
01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 2>that's also the magic of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the Internet has been</v>

1836
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:30.510
<v Speaker 2>successful because it allows anyone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>join without permission,</v>

1837
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.400
<v Speaker 2>connect to any application or service.</v>

1838
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.090
<v Speaker 2>They won't write an application and</v>
<v Speaker 2>launch it globally without tasking the</v>

1839
01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:37.770
<v Speaker 2>phone company if they're allowed to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1840
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no one to ask permission from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to extend that analogy,</v>

1841
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:49.670
<v Speaker 2>they also tried to build private</v>
<v Speaker 2>intranets and they're still trying</v>

1842
01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:53.100
<v Speaker 2>compuserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aol,</v>

1843
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 2>prodigy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the early closed networks that had</v>

1844
01:31:56.731 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>their own content that you could connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that weren't part of the Internet.</v>

1845
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:05.200
<v Speaker 2>And then after that corporate intranets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you heard of the intranet term?</v>

1846
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So when you have an internal network</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a company that has stale content,</v>

1848
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:13.060
<v Speaker 2>crappy applications and doesn't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world,</v>

1849
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's behind firewalls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an intranet,</v>

1850
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:20.820
<v Speaker 2>intra and trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've built those and they'd</v>

1851
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:25.830
<v Speaker 2>sometimes serve very useful purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the internet and you</v>

1852
01:32:25.841 --> 01:32:29.410
<v Speaker 2>can't scale them and make them secure</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make them useful enough.</v>

1853
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So essentially that would be</v>

1854
01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:35.660
<v Speaker 1>exactly be what would happen with money</v>
<v Speaker 1>if local banks or national banks.</v>

1855
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to follow from the title,</v>

1856
01:32:39.161 --> 01:32:41.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet of money is a very powerful</v>

1857
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 2>expression because it really explains</v>
<v Speaker 2>what this is.</v>

1858
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:48.700
<v Speaker 2>This is the internet of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it's open,</v>

1859
01:32:48.701 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 2>borderless global and requires no</v>
<v Speaker 2>permission to participate.</v>

1860
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.600
<v Speaker 2>And people will try to create the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intranet of money.</v>

1861
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it will have all of the limitations</v>

1862
01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:02.470
<v Speaker 2>that it's a traditional banking system</v>
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>

1863
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

1864
01:33:04.091 --> 01:33:06.700
<v Speaker 2>they can come along and do that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

1865
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:11.020
<v Speaker 2>The nice thing is that people don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a choice to use one or the</v>

1866
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:16.021
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only system of monopoly we have is</v>

1867
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:21.190
<v Speaker 2>that you have to use the national</v>
<v Speaker 2>currency of the country you were born in</v>

1868
01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:23.860
<v Speaker 2>and you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to pay the government of that</v>

1869
01:33:23.861 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

1870
01:33:25.721 --> 01:33:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you're free to use any currency you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

1871
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Some of us are free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of us are not.</v>

1872
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And bitcoin fits into that model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the if you want to use it for this</v>

1873
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 2>particular use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use it</v>

1874
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:39.220
<v Speaker 1>well if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you extrapolate where all this stuff</v>

1875
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:40.620
<v Speaker 1>was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1876
01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're correct and if a over</v>

1877
01:33:43.841 --> 01:33:48.790
<v Speaker 1>the next 20 years bitcoin really does</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge as not just an acceptable</v>

1878
01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:53.791
<v Speaker 1>currency worldwide but it's right up</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with everything else and and maybe</v>

1879
01:33:54.491 --> 01:33:58.750
<v Speaker 1>even preferred by a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the know or tech savvy or what</v>

1880
01:33:58.751 --> 01:34:00.940
<v Speaker 1>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that really does take place,</v>

1881
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:06.570
<v Speaker 1>it's going to slowly but surely erode a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the major problems that we have</v>

1882
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:12.421
<v Speaker 1>with society today as far as this</v>
<v Speaker 1>government having massive amounts of</v>

1883
01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:17.881
<v Speaker 1>control over the economy and the banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the ones who sort of in force the</v>

1884
01:34:21.401 --> 01:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of laws that have allowed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortgage crisis's and allowed these</v>

1885
01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:30.961
<v Speaker 1>bubbles to occur and also to fund and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help fund the politicians that enable</v>

1886
01:34:33.031 --> 01:34:37.570
<v Speaker 1>them to keep these laws in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of that sort of is a lot of</v>

1887
01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:42.520
<v Speaker 1>that is because of power and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that power is going to go away if</v>

1888
01:34:42.521 --> 01:34:47.521
<v Speaker 1>something like cryptocurrencies emerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being the predominant way that we use</v>

1889
01:34:48.161 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 1>and exchange money.</v>

1890
01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the optimistic way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 2>The less optimistic way to look at it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that over the next decade we are going</v>

1892
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 2>to gradually move into a cashless</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital money society.</v>

1893
01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of doing that now with work</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple.</v>

1894
01:35:06.351 --> 01:35:09.800
<v Speaker 2>We are doing that already and there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>some countries that are completely</v>

1895
01:35:09.801 --> 01:35:14.360
<v Speaker 2>cashless really where that are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to completely cashless.</v>

1896
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Ironically one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the countries that has a very</v>

1897
01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:24.161
<v Speaker 2>high degree of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital money is Kenya because of</v>

1898
01:35:25.341 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Empaysah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the mobile money they have,</v>

1899
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 2>which has now taken over a significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the GDP.</v>

1900
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:34.550
<v Speaker 2>We're also seeing in Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries now cash is less than I think</v>

1901
01:35:34.551 --> 01:35:39.551
<v Speaker 2>is less than 8% of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the productive use of money using</v>

1902
01:35:41.421 --> 01:35:46.350
<v Speaker 2>credit cards is what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I credit debit mobile pay APP.</v>

1903
01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:49.580
<v Speaker 2>What is Kenyon's MPA?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that and pay has a text</v>

1904
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:50.414
<v Speaker 2>message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1905
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.240
<v Speaker 2>text message money.</v>

1906
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's money you can send through sms.</v>

1907
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 2>It started off as basically people</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanging minutes,</v>

1908
01:35:58.191 --> 01:36:02.210
<v Speaker 2>mobile minutes that were transferable by</v>
<v Speaker 2>SMS and they started using it as</v>

1909
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 2>currency and then eventually it became</v>
<v Speaker 2>officially a corresponding currency to</v>

1910
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the Kenyan Pesa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now as the predominant currency</v>

1911
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.600
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1912
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and in most places from what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

1913
01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:15.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been to Kenya but I've talked</v>

1914
01:36:15.741 --> 01:36:17.270
<v Speaker 2>to a lot of Kenyans who tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1915
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:20.570
<v Speaker 2>we all use that and only that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>use cash.</v>

1916
01:36:20.571 --> 01:36:22.220
<v Speaker 2>We don't use credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1917
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.310
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem.</v>

1918
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we are going to a digital</v>
<v Speaker 2>current society where cash will be</v>

1919
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:35.800
<v Speaker 2>gradually eradicated either through non</v>
<v Speaker 2>use or a lot of countries and a lot of</v>

1920
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:39.470
<v Speaker 2>governments are trying to actively ban</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1921
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:42.350
<v Speaker 2>So they're putting limits on how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use cash.</v>

1922
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Say you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,000 and if it's more than a thousand</v>

1923
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:47.930
<v Speaker 2>dollars using cash as illegal.</v>

1924
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.490
<v Speaker 2>When we go to the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to really think about the</v>

1925
01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:55.280
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we want a society in which our</v>

1926
01:36:55.281 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 2>digital money is under a complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>surveillance and complete control where</v>

1927
01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:05.140
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the wrong protest or if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>support the wrong political campaign or</v>

1928
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:09.680
<v Speaker 2>if you make a payment to the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>person or receive money from the wrong</v>

1929
01:37:09.681 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly your money disappears.</v>

1930
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:14.180
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer yours anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen,</v>

1931
01:37:14.181 --> 01:37:16.310
<v Speaker 2>it's seized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

1932
01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone has control of that.</v>

1933
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banks,</v>

1934
01:37:21.711 --> 01:37:24.410
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in most cases there is no difference</v>

1935
01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:26.340
<v Speaker 2>between corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank and governments.</v>

1936
01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1937
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:32.990
<v Speaker 2>and so that's one scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other scenario is one in which</v>

1938
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:35.420
<v Speaker 2>individuals control their money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is digital money,</v>

1939
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:39.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's digital cash like bitcoin where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pay an individual from one</v>

1940
01:37:39.681 --> 01:37:44.000
<v Speaker 2>person to another just like I can with</v>
<v Speaker 2>cash today without any other party</v>

1941
01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:44.834
<v Speaker 2>getting involved.</v>

1942
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:50.300
<v Speaker 2>What really strikes me as amazing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've gotten used to this idea so</v>

1943
01:37:50.301 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that we no longer pay people,</v>

1944
01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 2>we no longer pay people directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last we use cash is the more we pay</v>

1945
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:04.560
<v Speaker 2>people through a corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1946
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:10.130
<v Speaker 2>So from tipping your Valet to tipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>your taxi driver to tipping wherever</v>

1947
01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.980
<v Speaker 2>tipping is pretty much the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>remaining part of our society where cash</v>

1948
01:38:16.651 --> 01:38:21.651
<v Speaker 2>is used to pay from one person who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an incorporated entity to another</v>

1949
01:38:22.261 --> 01:38:24.420
<v Speaker 2>person who is not an incorporated</v>
<v Speaker 2>entity.</v>

1950
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Everything else you have to pay for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation,</v>

1951
01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.130
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1952
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.830
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Venmo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's paypal,</v>

1953
01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 2>where they're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those things.</v>

1954
01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 2>And we've gradually gotten used to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where we can't pay another</v>

1955
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 2>person unless there's a corporation</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

1956
01:38:41.210 --> 01:38:44.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's astonishing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as cash disappears,</v>

1957
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:49.340
<v Speaker 2>that then becomes a final fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single payment in your life will</v>

1958
01:38:49.951 --> 01:38:53.310
<v Speaker 2>be from Utah Corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the corporation takes a piece of</v>

1959
01:38:53.311 --> 01:38:55.620
<v Speaker 2>that every single thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not just that,</v>

1960
01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.760
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just take a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also controls and surveils and</v>

1961
01:38:59.761 --> 01:39:02.370
<v Speaker 2>monitors your juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you violate the terms and</v>

1962
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:03.990
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are destitute.</v>

1963
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are,</v>

1964
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:11.990
<v Speaker 2>so the issue is not what we have today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First is the digital currency of the</v>

1965
01:39:12.421 --> 01:39:17.421
<v Speaker 2>future or bitcoin or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's both futures are a digital currency</v>

1966
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 2>and in both futures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cash will no longer exist.</v>

1967
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:25.320
<v Speaker 2>That is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going down that road and now we</v>

1968
01:39:25.321 --> 01:39:29.700
<v Speaker 2>have to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we go to the digital cashless society</v>

1969
01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.760
<v Speaker 2>of corporate control over money with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete and total merging of corporates</v>

1970
01:39:35.851 --> 01:39:36.690
<v Speaker 2>and state's money</v>

1971
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:41.010
<v Speaker 2>where instead of having separation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and money,</v>

1972
01:39:41.011 --> 01:39:44.880
<v Speaker 2>you have the merging of state and money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and corporation and money where your</v>

1973
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:49.881
<v Speaker 2>money is branded money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have chase dollars,</v>

1974
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.990
<v Speaker 2>you have Goldman Sachs dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have coca cola dollars,</v>

1975
01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:57.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have money that is controlled by a</v>

1976
01:39:57.361 --> 01:39:59.970
<v Speaker 2>corporation or do we go down the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>future?</v>

1977
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.500
<v Speaker 2>What we have money that is basically an</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet protocol that is completely</v>

1978
01:40:04.501 --> 01:40:06.810
<v Speaker 2>global,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that any person can pay any person they</v>

1979
01:40:06.811 --> 01:40:09.420
<v Speaker 2>meet in the streets without any</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations getting involved.</v>

1980
01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Just for me to you digital cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the,</v>

1981
01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:18.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a less optimistic view because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully aware of what the other future is</v>

1982
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:21.750
<v Speaker 2>and it's already playing out and it is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1983
01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:23.760
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very dangerous future.</v>

1984
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>This is so fascinating to me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so speculative and I love when you</v>

1985
01:40:28.501 --> 01:40:31.890
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's going to happen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone presents a bunch of different</v>

1986
01:40:31.891 --> 01:40:36.891
<v Speaker 1>scenarios and you get the mind starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder and then you also sort of plan</v>

1987
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:40.170
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it becomes like something to,</v>

1988
01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.340
<v Speaker 1>it almost becomes something to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to our bed on.</v>

1989
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:45.383
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1990
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 1>oh I bet it's going to work like this or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you because we really don't know.</v>

1991
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1992
01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the resistance that bitcoin is</v>

1993
01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:57.021
<v Speaker 1>facing from financial institutions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in control right now?</v>

1994
01:40:57.731 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Because there must be some form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of resistance.</v>

1995
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:06.181
<v Speaker 1>And is there any fuckery involved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there any sabotaging of bitcoin</v>

1996
01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 1>that has been suspected or proven?</v>

1997
01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know if there's any</v>

1998
01:41:13.041 --> 01:41:14.750
<v Speaker 2>sabotaging going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1999
01:41:14.751 --> 01:41:16.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a claim expected.</v>

2000
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any claims,</v>

2001
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:21.380
<v Speaker 2>just wink at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell him what to say.</v>

2002
01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to talk about is the,</v>

2003
01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:28.400
<v Speaker 2>the progression of what happens when a</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant,</v>

2004
01:41:28.401 --> 01:41:31.910
<v Speaker 2>well-established financial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>istation that's been around for 50 years</v>

2005
01:41:31.911 --> 01:41:36.860
<v Speaker 2>or 100 years is faced with a disruptor</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they cannot tamp down,</v>

2006
01:41:36.861 --> 01:41:41.861
<v Speaker 2>that they cannot shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sue by coopt eradicate band,</v>

2007
01:41:42.621 --> 01:41:44.060
<v Speaker 2>legislate against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2008
01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happens then is what I call the</v>

2009
01:41:46.761 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 2>five stages of grief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2010
01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:53.660
<v Speaker 2>first we start with denial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2011
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:56.090
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we saw this play out exactly like</v>

2012
01:41:56.091 --> 01:41:59.000
<v Speaker 2>this with a banking industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first reaction was denial.</v>

2013
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin can't possibly work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real money.</v>

2014
01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no value.</v>

2015
01:42:05.541 --> 01:42:06.710
<v Speaker 2>It will never survive.</v>

2016
01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward five hears you keep making</v>
<v Speaker 2>that argument becomes less and less</v>

2017
01:42:11.841 --> 01:42:15.260
<v Speaker 2>credible because it's not real money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet.</v>

2018
01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.210
<v Speaker 2>The big metal bird that brought me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles today was paid,</v>

2019
01:42:20.211 --> 01:42:21.590
<v Speaker 2>was not money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2020
01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you can claim it's not money all day</v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

2021
01:42:27.021 --> 01:42:29.060
<v Speaker 2>And I've been living on it for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2022
01:42:29.061 --> 01:42:32.240
<v Speaker 2>which kind of undermines the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2023
01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I earn it and I spend it and people</v>

2024
01:42:34.851 --> 01:42:38.000
<v Speaker 2>give me rides and big metal birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's money.</v>

2025
01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that isn't working.</v>

2026
01:42:41.181 --> 01:42:43.190
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go away on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to die.</v>

2027
01:42:43.191 --> 01:42:46.880
<v Speaker 2>It's going to lose all its value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time it dumps in value,</v>

2028
01:42:46.881 --> 01:42:49.010
<v Speaker 2>they cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like finally bitcoin is dead.</v>

2029
01:42:49.011 --> 01:42:52.070
<v Speaker 2>They write another obituary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We publish them on Bitcoin,</v>

2030
01:42:52.071 --> 01:42:57.071
<v Speaker 2>obituaries.com to make fun of them later</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now has 110 obituaries I think</v>

2031
01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:59.090
<v Speaker 2>published every time they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2032
01:42:59.091 --> 01:43:00.350
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is every two months.</v>

2033
01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denial only works for a while.</v>

2034
01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Then they go into anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the money of terrorists,</v>

2035
01:43:06.561 --> 01:43:09.950
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paedophiles pornographers and the</v>

2036
01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:12.560
<v Speaker 2>unsavory elements of this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pedophiles.</v>

2037
01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.590
<v Speaker 2>That's always the one they pull out.</v>

2038
01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:15.971
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2039
01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:17.310
<v Speaker 1>they love to use that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2040
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they find one by one pedophile,</v>

2041
01:43:20.171 --> 01:43:22.580
<v Speaker 1>he uses bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pedophile current.</v>

2042
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2043
01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty trick.</v>

2044
01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:28.450
<v Speaker 2>It is a bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a bit,</v>

2045
01:43:28.451 --> 01:43:32.570
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a dirty term trick and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to do this again and again and</v>

2046
01:43:32.571 --> 01:43:33.404
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2047
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:35.490
<v Speaker 2>they did it with the intranet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intranet.</v>

2048
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:38.060
<v Speaker 2>When it first came out they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2049
01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you heard this media narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2050
01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sells papers.</v>

2051
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.810
<v Speaker 2>It sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't sell clicks at the time cause</v>

2052
01:43:44.811 --> 01:43:46.610
<v Speaker 2>that we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the Internet but it sells</v>

2053
01:43:46.611 --> 01:43:49.250
<v Speaker 2>papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the idea that the internet is a</v>

2054
01:43:49.251 --> 01:43:52.730
<v Speaker 2>haven of crux and fraudsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists and pdf files and</v>

2055
01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 2>pornographers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2056
01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2057
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:57.510
<v Speaker 2>criminal use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced technology,</v>

2058
01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.870
<v Speaker 2>criminal use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most advanced technology they can</v>

2059
01:43:59.871 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>get their hands on because they're in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very highly competitive high margin,</v>

2060
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 2>high risk business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course they're going to tell you</v>

2061
01:44:07.821 --> 01:44:12.290
<v Speaker 2>they criminals wear shoes to run away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from bank heist criminals drive cars to</v>

2062
01:44:12.291 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>get away from bank robberies.</v>

2063
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.130
<v Speaker 2>They use cell phones to coordinate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2064
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.130
<v Speaker 2>They drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is not to die of dehydration.</v>

2065
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.380
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to ban all of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2066
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have that anger.</v>

2067
01:44:26.650 --> 01:44:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they tried that for a while.</v>

2068
01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Every time they try that you just turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and say,</v>

2069
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2070
01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the biggest money launderers of</v>

2071
01:44:36.351 --> 01:44:39.800
<v Speaker 2>drugs in the world are HSBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hong Kong,</v>

2072
01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shanghai banking consortium.</v>

2073
01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Inconvenient fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is in the world.</v>

2074
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would call it the model in your</v>

2075
01:44:49.191 --> 01:44:54.191
<v Speaker 2>laundering $700 billion for the Sinaloa</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartel over a period of 10 years during</v>

2076
01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:59.540
<v Speaker 2>which 19,000 people died in Mexico as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct result of that.</v>

2077
01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And they got a fine and no one went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

2078
01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 2>So there are inconvenient facts like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2079
01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Every time they say bitcoin funds</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>

2080
01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:10.490
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2081
01:45:11.210 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 2>I see them driving Toyota's in Humvees.</v>

2082
01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

2083
01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a bit in Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>

2084
01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:24.190
<v Speaker 2>they're driving around in the vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We left behind and there they got a lot</v>

2085
01:45:24.801 --> 01:45:29.300
<v Speaker 2>of their funding from pallets of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we left behind and they're getting</v>

2086
01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:34.301
<v Speaker 2>paid for dollar in dollars for oil that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're selling to our closest allies.</v>

2087
01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't really mentioned Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

2088
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are the inconvenient truths,</v>

2089
01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:42.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't talk about these in polite</v>

2090
01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 2>company or at least you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2091
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 2>that's what I said when I was invited to</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak in front of the Senate and Canada</v>

2092
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.070
<v Speaker 2>and they started asking me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and I said that actually</v>

2093
01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.760
<v Speaker 2>mostly funded by our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did these say that was the end</v>

2094
01:45:55.761 --> 01:45:57.570
<v Speaker 2>of that train of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped too.</v>

2095
01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.153
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2096
01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:04.210
<v Speaker 2>It was live public TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what went down when we moved on to</v>

2097
01:46:04.401 --> 01:46:07.010
<v Speaker 2>talk about more realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting things in a much more</v>

2098
01:46:07.011 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 2>positive view of what this thing is.</v>

2099
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:12.280
<v Speaker 2>They tried to discredit bitcoin by</v>
<v Speaker 2>attaching it to terrorism and you</v>

2100
01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:16.520
<v Speaker 2>informed them of the facts of where</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists are actually funded from.</v>

2101
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a very public forum on live TV,</v>

2102
01:46:19.161 --> 01:46:22.490
<v Speaker 2>which was very difficult to continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>that line of conversation.</v>

2103
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:28.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there resistance in Canada isn't the</v>

2104
01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:28.980
<v Speaker 2>United States?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2105
01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:32.000
<v Speaker 2>actually they've been very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very positive.</v>

2106
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Very positive too towards um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards cryptocurrencies in general.</v>

2107
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:38.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2108
01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of development going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2109
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:43.640
<v Speaker 2>There isn't that much resistance in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States really.</v>

2110
01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.880
<v Speaker 2>The banks were shutting down bank</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts in some cases.</v>

2111
01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that in the United Kingdom to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>

2112
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 2>right right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's the percentage of people</v>

2113
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:55.260
<v Speaker 2>that are using bitcoin on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>basis?</v>

2114
01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.400
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2115
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.520
<v Speaker 2>primarily because there is no clear</v>
<v Speaker 2>association between one person and one</v>

2116
01:47:05.101 --> 01:47:08.040
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin address or account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no account,</v>

2117
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:10.010
<v Speaker 2>right to use bitcoin.</v>

2118
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:12.330
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is download the</v>
<v Speaker 2>application on your phone.</v>

2119
01:47:12.331 --> 01:47:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to register anything and</v>

2120
01:47:14.581 --> 01:47:18.150
<v Speaker 2>so as a result it's just like how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ip addresses are in use.</v>

2121
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Does that tell you anything about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people are using the internet?</v>

2122
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't really tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>

2123
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because of its nature.</v>

2124
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I would say we're probably looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>about two to 4 million users based on</v>

2125
01:47:32.251 --> 01:47:33.150
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

2126
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Based on activity levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on logins to websites that some of</v>

2127
01:47:37.261 --> 01:47:40.830
<v Speaker 2>them publish results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to say for sure.</v>

2128
01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many mostly concentrated in the u s</v>

2129
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 2>of the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a plus 1% somewhere in the range</v>

2130
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 2>of 1% of of the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

2131
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is globally.</v>

2132
01:47:52.670 --> 01:47:53.503
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>globally.</v>

2133
01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Globally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>globally.</v>

2134
01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe two to 4 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said most of them are in the</v>

2135
01:47:57.331 --> 01:47:57.900
<v Speaker 2>United States?</v>

2136
01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Most of the main,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

2137
01:47:59.310 --> 01:48:01.950
<v Speaker 2>many of them are also in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About a 4 million.</v>

2138
01:48:01.951 --> 01:48:04.290
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 1% of America,</v>

2139
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2140
01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:07.500
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe half a percent.</v>

2141
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

2142
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

2143
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:13.890
<v Speaker 2>But what is happening is it's doubling</v>
<v Speaker 2>every here in terms of transaction</v>

2144
01:48:13.891 --> 01:48:15.390
<v Speaker 2>volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transaction amounts,</v>

2145
01:48:15.391 --> 01:48:18.390
<v Speaker 2>number of everything is doubling every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2146
01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of characteristic curve</v>

2147
01:48:21.151 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 2>you see in disruptive technologies being</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted.</v>

2148
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:27.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very promising curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the tipping point?</v>

2149
01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what needs to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that needs to happen</v>

2150
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:32.490
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for widespread adoption?</v>

2151
01:48:33.570 --> 01:48:34.560
<v Speaker 2>You've got a need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2152
01:48:35.490 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be ready and it's gotta be</v>

2153
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:41.130
<v Speaker 2>easy to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so right now,</v>

2154
01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to use.</v>

2155
01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not ready for mass adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in many parts of the developed</v>

2156
01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:51.270
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really need it.</v>

2157
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.630
<v Speaker 2>So in order to make it something we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>

2158
01:48:55.050 --> 01:48:58.110
<v Speaker 2>either what we already have has to not</v>
<v Speaker 2>work so well.</v>

2159
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.530
<v Speaker 2>This is what's happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing world where you have banking</v>

2160
01:49:01.531 --> 01:49:03.720
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which drives people into a safe haven,</v>

2161
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>or you invent to applications that</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be done before.</v>

2162
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.280
<v Speaker 2>A self driving car that you pay by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mile automatically as you're driving</v>

2163
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:15.100
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2164
01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2165
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:20.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro payments industry for paying for</v>

2166
01:49:20.101 --> 01:49:22.120
<v Speaker 2>contents directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2167
01:49:22.290 --> 01:49:27.290
<v Speaker 2>the intranet of things where devices can</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy services online automatically.</v>

2168
01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Things that you can't do with credit</v>
<v Speaker 2>cards.</v>

2169
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I think if you start seeing applications</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that to merge and I'm very</v>

2170
01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:37.320
<v Speaker 2>confident they're coming because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the innovation behind them,</v>

2171
01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.580
<v Speaker 2>then you can make it something that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>more needed even in the developed world.</v>

2172
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:47.380
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think could be done to sort</v>

2173
01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 2>of further this along or to accelerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

2174
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that can be done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2175
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the third ingredient is making</v>

2176
01:49:56.801 --> 01:49:59.590
<v Speaker 2>it easier for people to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a matter of innovation and</v>

2177
01:49:59.591 --> 01:50:00.730
<v Speaker 2>maturity and we're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2178
01:50:00.731 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 2>that's already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

2179
01:50:02.171 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have to wait and be patient</v>

2180
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>until it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could be like the steps that can be</v>

2181
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:10.600
<v Speaker 2>taken to make something like bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to use?</v>

2182
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things to do.</v>

2183
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>user interfaces,</v>

2184
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:16.920
<v Speaker 2>design security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making backup,</v>

2185
01:50:16.921 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>EEC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>providing infrastructure services,</v>

2186
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.760
<v Speaker 2>exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2187
01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2188
01:50:23.710 --> 01:50:25.110
<v Speaker 2>your paycheck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2189
01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 2>your atm services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your debit card services,</v>

2190
01:50:30.010 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 2>merchant services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2191
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2192
01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 2>one of the examples I like to use is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got on the intranet in 1989 I sent my</v>

2193
01:50:38.261 --> 01:50:43.261
<v Speaker 2>first emails shortly thereafter about</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,990 and in order to send my first</v>

2194
01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:47.290
<v Speaker 2>email,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to have a unix command line</v>

2195
01:50:47.291 --> 01:50:50.920
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a login into a unix mainframe with</v>

2196
01:50:50.921 --> 01:50:54.310
<v Speaker 2>access to an Internet connection at an</v>
<v Speaker 2>academic institution.</v>

2197
01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:59.730
<v Speaker 2>And then I worked very hard for about</v>
<v Speaker 2>two days to get the software working and</v>

2198
01:51:00.731 --> 01:51:03.190
<v Speaker 2>then eventually essence an email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it took a couple of days to</v>

2199
01:51:03.191 --> 01:51:05.920
<v Speaker 2>cross the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2200
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:11.310
<v Speaker 2>And then almost exactly 20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom went swipe and did the same thing</v>

2201
01:51:13.481 --> 01:51:16.390
<v Speaker 2>on her ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you take,</v>

2202
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:20.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two days of compiling software writing</v>

2203
01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:23.800
<v Speaker 2>complex unix commands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending an email and it takes a while to</v>

2204
01:51:23.801 --> 01:51:27.670
<v Speaker 2>get across the Internet and then 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years later that's down to swipe.</v>

2205
01:51:28.150 --> 01:51:32.080
<v Speaker 2>When we can take fic coin from after</v>
<v Speaker 2>install a wallet to understand what it</v>

2206
01:51:32.081 --> 01:51:34.630
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Qr Code of the bitcoin address and</v>

2207
01:51:34.631 --> 01:51:36.310
<v Speaker 2>how do I back it up and secure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2208
01:51:36.311 --> 01:51:40.060
<v Speaker 2>And you turn that into swipe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll be ready.</v>

2209
01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:43.450
<v Speaker 2>But there isn't there a vast difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>though between something like email,</v>

2210
01:51:43.451 --> 01:51:45.370
<v Speaker 2>which is not just a disruptive</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

2211
01:51:45.371 --> 01:51:47.590
<v Speaker 2>but a completely new innovation.</v>

2212
01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:52.030
<v Speaker 2>The ability to send things wirelessly</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the air or even wired like</v>

2213
01:51:52.031 --> 01:51:56.930
<v Speaker 2>electronic mail did not exist but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but males,</v>

2214
01:51:57.670 --> 01:51:59.800
<v Speaker 2>but mail did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just a change in the</v>

2215
01:51:59.801 --> 01:52:02.410
<v Speaker 2>medium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially you're doing correspondence,</v>

2216
01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much easier and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient.</v>

2217
01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like using a credit card right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is fairly convenient.</v>

2218
01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Online banking,</v>

2219
01:52:10.630 --> 01:52:13.330
<v Speaker 2>fairly convenient for people who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit cards.</v>

2220
01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.720
<v Speaker 2>And now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the numbers really benefit</v>

2221
01:52:16.721 --> 01:52:19.720
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the age of the Internet and</v>

2222
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:23.920
<v Speaker 2>instead of economic inclusion becoming</v>
<v Speaker 2>crater instead of more people around the</v>

2223
01:52:23.921 --> 01:52:26.530
<v Speaker 2>world having ready access to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies,</v>

2224
01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:30.870
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing entire country's getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut off from economic inclusion.</v>

2225
01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.040
<v Speaker 2>The banking system is not expanding as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast,</v>

2226
01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reach these populations.</v>

2227
01:52:35.291 --> 01:52:39.340
<v Speaker 2>And there's this vast gap left and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap is several billion people.</v>

2228
01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And into that gap you can fit anyone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has access to even a rudimentary,</v>

2229
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:51.010
<v Speaker 2>a feature phone or smartphone with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very basic level of data service.</v>

2230
01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the level at which you need to have</v>

2231
01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>technology in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone to adopt bitcoin and</v>

2232
01:52:58.581 --> 01:53:03.581
<v Speaker 2>immediately become in themselves a</v>
<v Speaker 2>global bank in the back pocket of their</v>

2233
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:09.370
<v Speaker 2>pants compared to the level that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would need to reach before jp Morgan</v>

2234
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Chase built a branch within their area</v>
<v Speaker 2>and offer them services after going</v>

2235
01:53:17.751 --> 01:53:20.960
<v Speaker 2>through a very careful verification of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their identity and blah,</v>

2236
01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:21.351
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2237
01:53:21.351 --> 01:53:21.800
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

2238
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>That's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to get to leap frogging</v>

2239
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like in many places in Africa.</v>

2240
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:32.960
<v Speaker 2>The first leap frogging events we saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was noted upon people wrote books</v>

2241
01:53:32.961 --> 01:53:36.140
<v Speaker 2>about this is the fact that in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>places in Africa,</v>

2242
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:39.970
<v Speaker 2>landlines were never deployed because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2243
01:53:39.971 --> 01:53:44.630
<v Speaker 2>the difficulty to actually extend</v>
<v Speaker 2>landlines was so high that when cell</v>

2244
01:53:44.631 --> 01:53:47.780
<v Speaker 2>phones came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point it became easier to just</v>

2245
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:51.620
<v Speaker 2>go directly to cell phones and bypass</v>
<v Speaker 2>that entire generation of technology.</v>

2246
01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're expecting,</v>

2247
01:53:55.820 --> 01:54:00.080
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly see it as very possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see leapfrogging in economic</v>

2248
01:54:00.081 --> 01:54:02.480
<v Speaker 2>inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability for people to join the</v>

2249
01:54:02.481 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Internet of money long before they ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>see a bank.</v>

2250
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:09.770
<v Speaker 2>The end result is it's not just about</v>
<v Speaker 2>banking,</v>

2251
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:13.760
<v Speaker 2>the unbanked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about debunking all of us to my</v>

2252
01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 2>banking as an application.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need an institution,</v>

2253
01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.990
<v Speaker 2>you just need an application.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that transition is pretty</v>

2254
01:54:20.991 --> 01:54:21.824
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

2255
01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Is there any concern that people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take people's phones and hold them at</v>

2256
01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:27.690
<v Speaker 1>gunpoint and just steal all their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin?</v>

2257
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you own,</v>

2258
01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:32.250
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a wallet and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallet is all you own,</v>

2259
01:54:32.251 --> 01:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're on bitcoin 20 years from now</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is,</v>

2260
01:54:35.610 --> 01:54:38.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your entire financial portfolio exists</v>

2261
01:54:38.641 --> 01:54:42.510
<v Speaker 1>on your phone and someone can come along</v>
<v Speaker 1>and force you at gunpoint to transfer</v>

2262
01:54:42.511 --> 01:54:44.550
<v Speaker 1>that over their phone and then they take</v>
<v Speaker 1>off in the night.</v>

2263
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:45.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2264
01:54:45.581 --> 01:54:47.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all already today,</v>

2265
01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't keep your entire financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>portfolio on your phone.</v>

2266
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2267
01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.550
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of very convenient</v>
<v Speaker 2>and easy to use devices that allow you</v>

2268
01:54:57.551 --> 01:55:02.080
<v Speaker 2>to storage or bit coin securely on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>offline device.</v>

2269
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of my bag,</v>

2270
01:55:04.091 --> 01:55:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I might show them to you later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2271
01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:07.240
<v Speaker 2>which allow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>

2272
01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:08.141
<v Speaker 2>but you might not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2273
01:55:08.141 --> 01:55:09.220
<v Speaker 2>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show them to you now.</v>

2274
01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:10.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

2275
01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:16.510
<v Speaker 1>The way you said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like teasing me.</v>

2276
01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.320
<v Speaker 1>This is it for people at home that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>

2277
01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2278
01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2279
01:55:25.630 --> 01:55:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get wrapped up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>headphone cord.</v>

2280
01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2281
01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:34.660
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a device that a lot of people</v>

2282
01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:36.880
<v Speaker 2>in bitcoin are familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we see that?</v>

2283
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:41.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is called a bitcoin tresor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like one of those things,</v>

2285
01:55:41.081 --> 01:55:41.680
<v Speaker 2>those old ladies</v>

2286
01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.590
<v Speaker 1>ladies press when they fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2287
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I have fallen</v>

2288
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 2>and I can't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2289
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:49.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2290
01:55:49.891 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>so this is a USB device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can connect it to my computer.</v>

2291
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.061
<v Speaker 2>Can I see it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2292
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:55.860
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who have all your money now?</v>

2293
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:58.020
<v Speaker 2>So feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have all my money.</v>

2294
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 2>You have got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have,</v>

2295
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:03.760
<v Speaker 2>I have a backup of that device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2296
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is where what I mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>before is this 1224 word backups that I</v>

2297
01:56:07.711 --> 01:56:10.440
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that if I lose that device,</v>

2298
01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can recreate,</v>

2299
01:56:12.481 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 2>it's on my backup device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm carrying here already.</v>

2300
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Second one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a second one.</v>

2301
01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:23.260
<v Speaker 2>You have four of these and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer that 24 words seed to any</v>

2302
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:27.190
<v Speaker 2>device you want and it will immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>have access to all of your money and</v>

2303
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:28.350
<v Speaker 2>render this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2304
01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2305
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:31.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it won't render this one now</v>

2306
01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 2>because it can coexist on all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one has a pin number and a pass</v>

2307
01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:37.230
<v Speaker 2>phrase that you have to put in.</v>

2308
01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:39.900
<v Speaker 2>You would not be able to break into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>device.</v>

2309
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:40.930
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2310
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe most people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good at that shit,</v>

2311
01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is it possible that someone could</v>

2313
01:56:49.231 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to crack your 24 word</v>
<v Speaker 2>code?</v>

2314
01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:53.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2315
01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.750
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2316
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.810
<v Speaker 2>You say that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't say that online.</v>

2317
01:56:56.850 --> 01:57:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I say that Fuckin hackers man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take that shit as a challenge.</v>

2318
01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never say you can't hack me.</v>

2319
01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin in itself is the world's largest</v>

2320
01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:12.060
<v Speaker 2>bug bounty and this is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people haven't realized bounty.</v>

2321
01:57:12.570 --> 01:57:16.890
<v Speaker 2>A bug bounty is when a manufacturer of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of software,</v>

2322
01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:19.350
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts out the bunting bounty and says,</v>

2323
01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you $10,000 if you find a bug</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my software that someone could</v>

2324
01:57:23.251 --> 01:57:26.670
<v Speaker 2>exploit to break my software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull does bug bounties.</v>

2325
01:57:26.671 --> 01:57:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Google does bug bounties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of companies do these bug</v>

2326
01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:30.810
<v Speaker 2>bounties.</v>

2327
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:33.680
<v Speaker 2>It's very wise and it's great because</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do is that way they,</v>

2328
01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:37.080
<v Speaker 2>they find these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have professional packers really</v>

2329
01:57:37.081 --> 01:57:39.660
<v Speaker 2>who go in and break the software and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's legal.</v>

2330
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.610
<v Speaker 2>They do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:46.830
<v Speaker 2>But another way to look at this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin has 10 to $12 billion of market</v>

2332
01:57:46.831 --> 01:57:50.040
<v Speaker 2>capitalization behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you can find a way to break,</v>

2333
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.390
<v Speaker 2>say my 24 words seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have access to my money.</v>

2334
01:57:54.391 --> 01:57:59.391
<v Speaker 2>So my money is the bounty that's sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind that bug and this means that</v>

2335
01:58:00.331 --> 01:58:05.331
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is being tested and has it been</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested every single day of its seven</v>

2336
01:58:05.581 --> 01:58:08.880
<v Speaker 2>year existence with an ever increasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Bolt at the end of it,</v>

2337
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 2>which is why you see bitcoin exchanges</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they don't do good security,</v>

2338
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:17.970
<v Speaker 2>they get hacked and whoever hacks them</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets the bounty.</v>

2339
01:58:17.971 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 2>But bitcoin itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has the biggest bounty of the mall</v>

2340
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.670
<v Speaker 2>remains secure.</v>

2341
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it remains secure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam magical.</v>

2342
01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It's about spreading out the risk in</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a way that there is no single</v>

2343
01:58:30.931 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can put your thumb on an attack.</v>

2344
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:35.280
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little device,</v>

2345
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 2>these types of devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ones that have a fingerprint</v>

2346
01:58:39.481 --> 01:58:42.790
<v Speaker 2>scanner on them that are easy to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're um,</v>

2347
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:46.330
<v Speaker 2>they come in various form factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call these hardware wallets.</v>

2348
01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:51.340
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Bitcoin keys that's control my</v>

2349
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:56.341
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin are created on this device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They remain on this device and this</v>

2350
01:58:56.681 --> 01:59:01.390
<v Speaker 2>device signs transactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I can take it and I can plug</v>

2351
01:59:01.391 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it into this laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this laptop is compromised,</v>

2352
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will not be able to compromise this.</v>

2353
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I can take this and I can plug it in to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2354
01:59:12.131 --> 01:59:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those desktops they have in hotel</v>

2355
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>lobbies where you can print your</v>
<v Speaker 2>boarding pass.</v>

2356
01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consider that the Cesspool of computing</v>

2357
01:59:22.050 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go there.</v>

2358
01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:27.220
<v Speaker 2>That thing has 25 different viruses</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting for dominance.</v>

2359
01:59:27.221 --> 01:59:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you plug in a device,</v>

2360
01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 2>they start tearing each other apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get to your device.</v>

2361
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I can plug this in there and make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin transaction and not have to</v>

2362
01:59:38.051 --> 01:59:40.990
<v Speaker 2>worry about that because the keys stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>on here.</v>

2363
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one can figure out a virus for</v>

2364
01:59:43.671 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing.</v>

2365
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:48.520
<v Speaker 2>This is designed specifically to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2366
01:59:48.521 --> 01:59:53.521
<v Speaker 2>very narrow well defined interface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only thing you can send to it is</v>

2367
01:59:53.951 --> 01:59:58.540
<v Speaker 2>a bitcoin transaction and then displays</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bitcoin transaction on the screen.</v>

2368
01:59:58.570 --> 02:00:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And I can decide is that too I actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to pay.</v>

2369
02:00:01.150 --> 02:00:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Confirm and then I've paid them and</v>

2370
02:00:03.221 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 2>nobody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it impossible to integrate a virus</v>

2371
02:00:05.501 --> 02:00:10.501
<v Speaker 2>into a bitcoin transaction</v>
<v Speaker 2>code messages and certain software like</v>

2372
02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:15.330
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that what al Qaeda was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were sending pictures and</v>

2373
02:00:15.331 --> 02:00:19.450
<v Speaker 2>inside the actual digital image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones and Zeros,</v>

2374
02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:23.170
<v Speaker 2>there were encoding actual information</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could read and you can embed</v>

2375
02:00:23.171 --> 02:00:25.750
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the differences.</v>

2376
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:29.830
<v Speaker 2>You can't execute that data because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing will not execute the data it</v>

2377
02:00:29.831 --> 02:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>receives in the transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It simply runs a fingerprint function on</v>

2378
02:00:34.391 --> 02:00:37.990
<v Speaker 2>it and signs it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

2379
02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:40.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point of this is that Jamie's</v>

2380
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 2>incredulous look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2381
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Seems like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're setting a rule that's just going</v>

2382
02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:47.830
<v Speaker 2>to be broken in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2383
02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but next week we figured it out and now</v>

2384
02:00:51.761 --> 02:00:53.020
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2385
02:00:53.021 --> 02:00:53.531
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2386
02:00:53.531 --> 02:00:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I've had this device now for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2387
02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the first additions.</v>

2388
02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2389
02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.160
<v Speaker 2>my bitcoin on there and I haven't had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem yet.</v>

2390
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't put my money on exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep it on devices like this,</v>

2391
02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 2>which is why I haven't had lou money</v>
<v Speaker 2>stolen.</v>

2392
02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 2>The point of this is not to make it more</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure,</v>

2393
02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:19.030
<v Speaker 2>although it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to make security easy for someone</v>

2394
02:01:19.031 --> 02:01:20.110
<v Speaker 2>who's not technical.</v>

2395
02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I could create a whole elaborate system</v>
<v Speaker 2>as security experts to secure my</v>

2396
02:01:25.031 --> 02:01:27.100
<v Speaker 2>bitcoins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was never a problem.</v>

2397
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.130
<v Speaker 2>The point of this devices that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure your bitcoin,</v>

2398
02:01:30.131 --> 02:01:33.640
<v Speaker 2>my mum can secure her bitcoin without</v>
<v Speaker 2>really knowing how,</v>

2399
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.190
<v Speaker 2>but just simply following how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

2400
02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:41.000
<v Speaker 2>So it takes security packages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attendant device and simplifies it</v>

2401
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:43.040
<v Speaker 2>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2402
02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other question you asked me.</v>

2403
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.680
<v Speaker 2>What happens if someone points a gun at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

2404
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call that the $5 wrench solution.</v>

2405
02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall we build a 10,000 super?</v>

2406
02:01:54.771 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's from a cartoon by Randall Monroe</v>

2407
02:01:58.311 --> 02:01:59.810
<v Speaker 2>and XKCD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2408
02:01:59.811 --> 02:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>should we build a 10,000 supercomputer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to crack his encryption?</v>

2409
02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:04.101
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2410
02:02:04.101 --> 02:02:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Here's a $5 wrench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just beat him until he tells you what</v>

2411
02:02:06.591 --> 02:02:07.424
<v Speaker 2>the password is.</v>

2412
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:15.370
<v Speaker 2>So resistance to that is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that these devices</v>

2413
02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:19.850
<v Speaker 2>have and all the systems in bitcoin have</v>
<v Speaker 2>is duress passwords.</v>

2414
02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:23.810
<v Speaker 2>So you can put a small amount of bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a specific accounts that opens with a</v>

2415
02:02:23.811 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 2>different password.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you shouldn't know.</v>

2416
02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:29.750
<v Speaker 2>So the people know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see the motherfucker,</v>

2417
02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you gave me the duress password.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2418
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know which one is which.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a well known technique and</v>

2419
02:02:36.381 --> 02:02:40.970
<v Speaker 2>we actually recommend using fat as part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

2420
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I go to a country,</v>

2421
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where security isn't as good,</v>

2422
02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:51.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry my cash in a money belt or leave</v>

2423
02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:56.831
<v Speaker 2>it back at the hotel in a safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also carry a bundle of notes,</v>

2424
02:02:56.871 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 2>high value notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the equivalent of say,</v>

2425
02:02:58.881 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 2>$50 here in the United States in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>front pocket.</v>

2426
02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And if somebody comes at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls out a knife and says,</v>

2427
02:03:06.531 --> 02:03:11.531
<v Speaker 2>give me your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will hand them my phone is a throwaway</v>

2428
02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:12.050
<v Speaker 2>cash.</v>

2429
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 2>I haven't in my front pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I will walk away from that,</v>

2430
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 2>listen to this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to know this</v>

2431
02:03:16.761 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker has a belt and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>our real lewd is.</v>

2432
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:20.630
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2433
02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:23.660
<v Speaker 2>So I mean this is something a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do,</v>

2434
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:24.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2435
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why robbers are aware of it.</v>

2436
02:03:28.190 --> 02:03:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part they'll take the</v>

2437
02:03:30.171 --> 02:03:32.090
<v Speaker 2>cash that you hand them and run away</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

2438
02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2439
02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't help thinking like although</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little devices that you're storing</v>

2440
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>your bitcoin on look elegant in 2016 I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't help thinking that they're just</v>

2441
02:03:42.051 --> 02:03:44.960
<v Speaker 2>going to be like those Gordon Gekko</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant brick phones when he was walking</v>

2442
02:03:44.961 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 2>around the beach looking like a pimp</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Wall Street.</v>

2443
02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Remember that movie that they are that</v>
<v Speaker 2>know like he's holding that big ass</v>

2444
02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:54.230
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] they are that people will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching this show.</v>

2445
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A decade from now.</v>

2446
02:03:56.031 --> 02:03:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Laughing at those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing at those things.</v>

2447
02:03:57.951 --> 02:04:00.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's fine because guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found a photo yesterday.</v>

2448
02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I was looking through some of my files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found a photo of mate.</v>

2449
02:04:03.701 --> 02:04:04.534
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2450
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Look at him like a pimp with that big</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid phone.</v>

2451
02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I found a photo of me from 1991 with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leather,</v>

2452
02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>side carrier with one of those in that</v>

2453
02:04:19.551 --> 02:04:21.410
<v Speaker 2>holster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2454
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:25.490
<v Speaker 2>One of those brick phones is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the second generation Motorola.</v>

2455
02:04:25.570 --> 02:04:28.040
<v Speaker 2>So it was about this big dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can like ruin your hip,</v>

2456
02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>like all that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2457
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2458
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:33.103
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2459
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>I was a sophomore in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 1991 first cell phones who</v>

2460
02:04:39.151 --> 02:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>just come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in computer science.</v>

2461
02:04:40.741 --> 02:04:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm a geek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love gadgets.</v>

2462
02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>So I go by one of the first cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cost me an arm and a leg.</v>

2463
02:04:45.210 --> 02:04:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I paid like $5 a minute to make calls on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2464
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>$2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2465
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I think I paid something like 750 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>sterling at the time.</v>

2466
02:04:55.001 --> 02:04:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It was probably about a thousand bucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a thing like this.</v>

2467
02:04:58.460 --> 02:04:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Who's battery lasted an hour.</v>

2468
02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the batteries are so terrible.</v>

2469
02:05:04.681 --> 02:05:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fantastic photo of me with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leather holster with that strategy</v>

2470
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and I look so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I see it?</v>

2471
02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have her with me.</v>

2472
02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:15.840
<v Speaker 2>We have a physical photo somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually found the physical foot.</v>

2473
02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I haven't digitized them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do,</v>

2474
02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:20.010
<v Speaker 2>please send it my way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2475
02:05:20.011 --> 02:05:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was straight up on instagram.</v>

2476
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I also have poofy hair in the front and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing a ridiculous shirt.</v>

2477
02:05:28.150 --> 02:05:32.670
<v Speaker 2>You were Pimpin 1991 19 nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>College.</v>

2478
02:05:32.770 --> 02:05:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

2479
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.930
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will look ridiculous.</v>

2480
02:05:36.931 --> 02:05:41.931
<v Speaker 2>But the point that you make so well is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we did go from Gordon Gecko to</v>

2481
02:05:42.710 --> 02:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says five,</v>

2482
02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:45.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2483
02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:49.890
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to do that again in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin technology.</v>

2484
02:05:49.891 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 2>This isn't something that's standing</v>
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

2485
02:05:51.541 --> 02:05:53.550
<v Speaker 2>The amount of innovation that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening today,</v>

2486
02:05:53.551 --> 02:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>even though it's not mainstream yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is staggering.</v>

2487
02:05:56.790 --> 02:06:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I work in this space full time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I do is read about what is new in</v>

2488
02:06:00.901 --> 02:06:04.320
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and that's a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are there like you?</v>

2489
02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Are you the only one like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2490
02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:07.230
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>

2491
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>The only one who's this integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2492
02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:13.140
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a bunch of people like you.</v>

2493
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:13.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

2494
02:06:13.691 --> 02:06:17.730
<v Speaker 2>there's probably about a thousand people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you who are doing this.</v>

2495
02:06:17.731 --> 02:06:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were living off bitcoin constantly</v>

2496
02:06:20.581 --> 02:06:22.830
<v Speaker 2>investigating bid corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading about it all the time,</v>

2497
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>lecturing and writing books about</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

2498
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so many lecturing and writing books</v>

2499
02:06:27.331 --> 02:06:31.310
<v Speaker 2>about it or speaking with conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's hunt a hundred to 200 who</v>

2500
02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.390
<v Speaker 2>are doing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2501
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Hundred to 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2502
02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should talk to the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred and 99 maybe they make better</v>

2503
02:06:38.401 --> 02:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're crying.</v>

2504
02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>You</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2505
02:06:42.690 --> 02:06:43.523
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2506
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming any special mantle</v>

2507
02:06:45.451 --> 02:06:45.630
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2508
02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:49.350
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of people who are very much</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it as I am and it is a full time</v>

2509
02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:51.960
<v Speaker 2>job and because so much is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

2510
02:06:51.961 --> 02:06:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These devices will seem antiquated.</v>

2511
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:56.320
<v Speaker 2>What this shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however is that won't,</v>

2512
02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:00.720
<v Speaker 2>when I came on the show the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about three years ago,</v>

2513
02:07:01.410 --> 02:07:05.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't yet have one of these and I</v>

2514
02:07:05.311 --> 02:07:09.360
<v Speaker 2>used to store my bitcoin on what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>called a paper wallet,</v>

2515
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>which is basically where I print out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>additional keys with a convoluted</v>

2516
02:07:14.821 --> 02:07:18.360
<v Speaker 2>process to make sure my computer that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the printing isn't compromised</v>

2517
02:07:18.361 --> 02:07:22.290
<v Speaker 2>cause then they're compromised and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>send the money to those digital keys and</v>

2518
02:07:22.291 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 2>then put those in a vault in a safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>deposit box in a,</v>

2519
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 2>in a safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that worked great for two years.</v>

2520
02:07:28.561 --> 02:07:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I kept a small amount of bitcoin safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

2521
02:07:32.610 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a lot of expertise to execute on</v>

2522
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:39.820
<v Speaker 2>that and there are many ways to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

2523
02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>So we've progressed now the way you back</v>
<v Speaker 2>this up,</v>

2524
02:07:44.411 --> 02:07:48.370
<v Speaker 2>as you write down 24 English words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how hard is that that it shows to</v>

2525
02:07:48.371 --> 02:07:50.470
<v Speaker 2>you one at a time on the screen and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you,</v>

2526
02:07:50.471 --> 02:07:54.880
<v Speaker 2>write them down a runs with software in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a website which has really three or four</v>

2527
02:07:54.881 --> 02:07:56.590
<v Speaker 2>buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fairly easy to use.</v>

2528
02:07:56.710 --> 02:08:01.300
<v Speaker 2>The device itself has two buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably teach my mom how to use</v>

2529
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:04.330
<v Speaker 2>this and she owns bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be useful.</v>

2530
02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she owns one of these,</v>

2531
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:11.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd probably only use it when you're</v>

2532
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:12.790
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2533
02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:15.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't use it coming over.</v>

2534
02:08:15.150 --> 02:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Get Out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My little goofy fucking bitcoin thing.</v>

2535
02:08:18.251 --> 02:08:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Let me pretend I use this for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wouldn't humor me that way.</v>

2536
02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:23.893
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2537
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bottom line is that five years</v>

2538
02:08:28.451 --> 02:08:32.050
<v Speaker 2>from now this is going to be even</v>
<v Speaker 2>simpler and we keep iterating and</v>

2539
02:08:32.051 --> 02:08:35.440
<v Speaker 2>maturing the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not standing still.</v>

2540
02:08:35.710 --> 02:08:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And as it gets easier and easier and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people come on board,</v>

2541
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 2>not only are they able to use bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other cryptocurrencies,</v>

2542
02:08:43.031 --> 02:08:47.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're able to do it with security</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that doesn't require an</v>

2543
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the same.</v>

2544
02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:54.010
<v Speaker 2>This happened with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this fantastic show you see</v>

2545
02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:58.360
<v Speaker 2>in 1994 and they've got good morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>America and there's this clip from the</v>

2546
02:08:58.361 --> 02:09:01.870
<v Speaker 2>outtakes they're doing before they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this big internet story.</v>

2547
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And they have the host chatting amongst</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves before they started story and</v>

2548
02:09:05.771 --> 02:09:08.470
<v Speaker 2>one of them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is the intranet?</v>

2549
02:09:08.471 --> 02:09:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Is that the email?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2550
02:09:10.541 --> 02:09:10.901
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2551
02:09:10.901 --> 02:09:12.520
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just email.</v>

2552
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So the at sign is the intranet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2553
02:09:14.621 --> 02:09:14.861
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2554
02:09:14.861 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The outside his email.</v>

2555
02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:18.790
<v Speaker 2>It's the www.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2556
02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>that's Internet and Dotcom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's intranet.</v>

2557
02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:29.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's going through this process</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're trying to grasp this alien</v>

2558
02:09:30.311 --> 02:09:34.630
<v Speaker 2>and strange seeming technology and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the terminology is weird.</v>

2559
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's play this</v>

2560
02:09:38.730 --> 02:09:40.260
<v Speaker 5>as host.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doing that little tease.</v>

2561
02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:43.290
<v Speaker 5>Definitely mark with the a and then the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ring around it.</v>

2562
02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:47.780
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Katie said she thought it was about,</v>

2563
02:09:47.970 --> 02:09:49.050
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2564
02:09:49.290 --> 02:09:52.390
<v Speaker 5>but I'd never heard of it around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd never heard of mark,</v>

2565
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:54.960
<v Speaker 5>but never heard it said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it sounded stupid.</v>

2566
02:09:54.961 --> 02:09:59.961
<v Speaker 5>What I said at violence add NBC</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the lunchroom.</v>

2567
02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:03.840
<v Speaker 5>You say if there is violence at NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ge Calm.</v>

2568
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:08.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean alison should know what is</v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet anyway?</v>

2569
02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:12.590
<v Speaker 5>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that NASA computer network,</v>

2570
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:16.350
<v Speaker 5>the one that's becoming really big now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

2571
02:10:16.351 --> 02:10:18.570
<v Speaker 5>That's how does want it know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you write to it?</v>

2572
02:10:18.571 --> 02:10:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Like male?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2573
02:10:19.521 --> 02:10:22.950
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people use it and communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they can communicate with NBC</v>

2574
02:10:22.951 --> 02:10:24.360
<v Speaker 5>writers and producers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alison,</v>

2575
02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:26.790
<v Speaker 5>can you explain what Internet is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2576
02:10:26.791 --> 02:10:28.530
<v Speaker 5>she can't say anything in 10 seconds or</v>
<v Speaker 5>less.</v>

2577
02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:31.950
<v Speaker 5>Alison will be in the studio shortly.</v>

2578
02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:32.813
<v Speaker 5>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

2579
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:35.660
<v Speaker 5>A giant computer network made up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>made up of uh,</v>

2580
02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:38.840
<v Speaker 5>started from how I touch your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell us what this was and then look in</v>

2581
02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:40.430
<v Speaker 5>the dictionary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an,</v>

2582
02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:41.800
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2583
02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.140
<v Speaker 5>it's a computer billboard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2584
02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:46.040
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's several universities and everything</v>

2585
02:10:46.041 --> 02:10:49.640
<v Speaker 5>all joined together and others can</v>
<v Speaker 5>access it and it's getting bigger and</v>

2586
02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:51.680
<v Speaker 5>bigger roles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just spreading really handy during the</v>

2587
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:52.640
<v Speaker 5>quake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people,</v>

2588
02:10:52.641 --> 02:10:55.100
<v Speaker 5>that's how they were communicating out</v>
<v Speaker 5>to tell family and loved ones.</v>

2589
02:10:55.101 --> 02:10:57.070
<v Speaker 5>They were okay because all the phone</v>
<v Speaker 5>lines were down.</v>

2590
02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 5>I was telling Katie and I call me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't need that.</v>

2591
02:10:59.250 --> 02:11:01.170
<v Speaker 5>You don't need a phone line to offer</v>
<v Speaker 5>even know.</v>

2592
02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:06.070
<v Speaker 4>So if you show this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

2593
02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:08.290
<v Speaker 4>If you show this to a millennial right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2594
02:11:08.291 --> 02:11:09.850
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2595
02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:12.430
<v Speaker 4>94.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was just before the civil war,</v>

2596
02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:14.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is 18.</v>

2597
02:11:14.861 --> 02:11:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Is it 1894 slavery was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2598
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:20.020
<v Speaker 4>They had TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then back then it's like they can't even</v>

2599
02:11:20.021 --> 02:11:25.021
<v Speaker 4>conceive of a time when the Internet was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just so completely impossible to</v>

2600
02:11:26.081 --> 02:11:28.540
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel very fortunate that I grew up</v>

2601
02:11:28.541 --> 02:11:31.310
<v Speaker 4>without it and got to experience it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my twenties right?</v>

2602
02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:35.530
<v Speaker 4>I experienced it emerge and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2603
02:11:35.531 --> 02:11:37.660
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it didn't really have the same sort</v>

2604
02:11:37.661 --> 02:11:42.661
<v Speaker 4>of impact on my life that it has on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives of young people today that are</v>

2605
02:11:42.941 --> 02:11:46.000
<v Speaker 4>growing up with it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2606
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:49.540
<v Speaker 4>you look at kids today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to a store or go to the mall or</v>

2607
02:11:49.541 --> 02:11:50.980
<v Speaker 4>something like that and to go to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant,</v>

2608
02:11:51.010 --> 02:11:52.330
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking glued to their phone.</v>

2609
02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:54.100
<v Speaker 4>They're glued.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2610
02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:55.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here comes the prediction.</v>

2611
02:11:56.050 --> 02:11:58.210
<v Speaker 4>This generation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is growing up right now,</v>

2612
02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:01.090
<v Speaker 4>they'd never know a world without</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

2613
02:12:02.370 --> 02:12:04.540
<v Speaker 4>They also never know a world without</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitcoin.</v>

2614
02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:08.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't dare you now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 to 18 years from now,</v>

2615
02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.100
<v Speaker 4>none of them are going to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>driver's license because there will be</v>

2616
02:12:12.101 --> 02:12:16.390
<v Speaker 4>no self driving cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need one and wouldn't be no driving</v>

2617
02:12:16.391 --> 02:12:18.190
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking Montana where I could drive</v>

2618
02:12:18.191 --> 02:12:21.610
<v Speaker 4>my own God damn car won't be on hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A hobby.</v>

2619
02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.310
<v Speaker 4>It will be a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you'll pay $3,000 a month in</v>

2620
02:12:24.311 --> 02:12:27.010
<v Speaker 4>insurance to drive your own car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much?</v>

2621
02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:29.860
<v Speaker 4>I think you'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's going to go.</v>

2622
02:12:29.861 --> 02:12:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know humans behind the wheel,</v>

2623
02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:34.300
<v Speaker 4>grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds insane.</v>

2624
02:12:34.301 --> 02:12:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Housing dollars a month didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're going to be telling your</v>

2625
02:12:38.141 --> 02:12:39.160
<v Speaker 4>grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2626
02:12:39.161 --> 02:12:41.740
<v Speaker 4>we used to drive our own cars and say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds crazy.</v>

2627
02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Did to hundreds of thousands of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>die every year.</v>

2628
02:12:44.050 --> 02:12:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2629
02:12:46.061 --> 02:12:47.950
<v Speaker 4>But we live like men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2630
02:12:47.951 --> 02:12:50.050
<v Speaker 4>we didn't live suck in this digital</v>
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>

2631
02:12:50.051 --> 02:12:52.060
<v Speaker 4>Like all these other policies out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2632
02:12:52.061 --> 02:12:55.120
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But think about it this way.</v>

2633
02:12:55.150 --> 02:12:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Imagine a child born today that never</v>
<v Speaker 4>sees cash.</v>

2634
02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:00.173
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2635
02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:04.210
<v Speaker 4>they travel to another country where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're backwards and they still use</v>

2636
02:13:04.630 --> 02:13:07.990
<v Speaker 4>paper as money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now it's entirely possible.</v>

2637
02:13:07.991 --> 02:13:11.590
<v Speaker 4>So what seems inconceivable to us then</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes the norm.</v>

2638
02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Then it becomes inconceivable to live</v>
<v Speaker 4>without it.</v>

2639
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:17.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're trying to explain,</v>

2640
02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:22.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what consensus algorithm did the</v>

2641
02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:22.841
<v Speaker 4>Federal Reserve use?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2642
02:13:22.841 --> 02:13:27.310
<v Speaker 4>it's used the 12 white dudes decide for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you consensus.</v>

2643
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is a</v>

2644
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>proof of work algorithm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2645
02:13:33.721 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 2>no johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a proof of war algorithm backed</v>

2646
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:37.554
<v Speaker 2>by oil.</v>

2647
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I am happy you exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love having you on the show.</v>

2648
02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I love talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that you have this</v>

2649
02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:49.990
<v Speaker 1>beautiful vision of digital currency and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it worked and if you're correct and</v>

2650
02:13:49.991 --> 02:13:52.540
<v Speaker 1>it all pans out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be amazing.</v>

2651
02:13:52.570 --> 02:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I love that you know so much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that you come on here and educate</v>

2652
02:13:57.131 --> 02:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that every time you come on there</v>

2653
02:13:59.801 --> 02:14:02.320
<v Speaker 1>really does seem to be more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

2654
02:14:02.321 --> 02:14:04.510
<v Speaker 1>It is tangible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's trackable.</v>

2655
02:14:04.690 --> 02:14:07.810
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting and it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2656
02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm all in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on team bitcoin.</v>

2657
02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100% committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to happen.</v>

2658
02:14:13.690 --> 02:14:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just one of those things,</v>

2659
02:14:15.521 --> 02:14:17.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just entirely fascinating.</v>

2660
02:14:17.321 --> 02:14:22.321
<v Speaker 1>And until it absolutely is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like credit cards,</v>

2661
02:14:23.170 --> 02:14:26.170
<v Speaker 1>like the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the other things that you were</v>

2662
02:14:26.171 --> 02:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>describing that really didn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and now exists almost primarily.</v>

2663
02:14:31.090 --> 02:14:31.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2664
02:14:31.781 --> 02:14:33.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2665
02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:36.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely amazing and fascinating</v>

2666
02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.640
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways it's a solution for the</v>

2667
02:14:41.981 --> 02:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>control that the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Reserve,</v>

2668
02:14:46.091 --> 02:14:50.110
<v Speaker 1>the banks and even politicians have over</v>
<v Speaker 1>us today.</v>

2669
02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:53.920
<v Speaker 1>That conduct control is slowly being</v>
<v Speaker 1>eroded by the Internet.</v>

2670
02:14:53.921 --> 02:14:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Not even slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rapidly being eroded by the</v>

2671
02:14:56.771 --> 02:14:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even whatever control politicians used</v>

2672
02:14:59.351 --> 02:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as,</v>

2673
02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:06.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as easy to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more transparent.</v>

2674
02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so much easier to protest today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different realm or living in</v>

2675
02:15:11.201 --> 02:15:14.110
<v Speaker 1>a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that world is happening incredibly</v>

2676
02:15:14.111 --> 02:15:18.400
<v Speaker 1>rapidly from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got on in 1994 you were on before then</v>

2677
02:15:18.401 --> 02:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>when it was like this really fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange internet.</v>

2678
02:15:22.150 --> 02:15:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in the early days.</v>

2679
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm really fascinated to see what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be like 20 years from now and I</v>

2680
02:15:27.641 --> 02:15:28.480
<v Speaker 1>really do hope you're right.</v>

2681
02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the beautiful things about</v>

2682
02:15:32.961 --> 02:15:37.340
<v Speaker 2>this is I think if you've experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like this before,</v>

2683
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:40.700
<v Speaker 2>and we're very lucky to be part of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation where we have,</v>

2684
02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:44.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advancements in technology happening at</v>

2685
02:15:44.061 --> 02:15:46.460
<v Speaker 2>a rate where you don't just see one or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2686
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>but you see several in a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2687
02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:55.060
<v Speaker 2>That are pretty earth shattering in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their complexity and involvement.</v>

2688
02:15:55.131 --> 02:15:58.160
<v Speaker 2>We've seen the Internet's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen social media,</v>

2689
02:15:58.161 --> 02:16:00.530
<v Speaker 2>we've seen the miniaturization of</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>

2690
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to see self driving cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and digital currencies and all of these</v>

2691
02:16:06.531 --> 02:16:09.380
<v Speaker 2>other things in a single lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you've seen two or three of these,</v>

2692
02:16:09.381 --> 02:16:14.381
<v Speaker 2>you start capturing the pattern and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern is when it starts,</v>

2693
02:16:15.921 --> 02:16:18.590
<v Speaker 2>everybody ignores it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes fun of it.</v>

2694
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Can't possibly see how change would</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

2695
02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2696
02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.140
<v Speaker 2>and this happened with the automobile</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happened with electricity.</v>

2697
02:16:27.141 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It happens with credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First time credit</v>

2698
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.260
<v Speaker 4>cards were introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody thought they were going to work</v>

2699
02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:34.450
<v Speaker 4>is a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid experiment.</v>

2700
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wanted to take them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This happens with every type of</v>

2701
02:16:38.321 --> 02:16:40.990
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculed at first and then</v>

2702
02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:44.830
<v Speaker 4>gradually it matures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets less cumbersome to use.</v>

2703
02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 4>And if it has some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some fundamental properties,</v>

2704
02:16:48.431 --> 02:16:52.060
<v Speaker 4>some utilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something it's useful for that's</v>

2705
02:16:52.061 --> 02:16:53.080
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's new,</v>

2706
02:16:53.081 --> 02:16:55.450
<v Speaker 4>that you can do things with it you</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't do before,</v>

2707
02:16:56.050 --> 02:17:00.760
<v Speaker 4>then at some point it hits an inflection</v>
<v Speaker 4>point and it becomes mainstream very,</v>

2708
02:17:00.761 --> 02:17:05.080
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then everybody is both surprised and</v>

2709
02:17:05.081 --> 02:17:06.640
<v Speaker 4>at the same time claims ownership and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2710
02:17:06.641 --> 02:17:08.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always thought that this bit coin</v>

2711
02:17:08.711 --> 02:17:10.750
<v Speaker 4>thing would succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2712
02:17:10.751 --> 02:17:13.070
<v Speaker 4>let's hope we're those people.</v>
