<v Speaker 1>Just one.</v>

29
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:27.460

<v Speaker 1>That bond.</v>

39
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't have you in my left here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're like the voice of good</v>

40
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>or the voice of bad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Only.</v>

47
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Probably the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of America too,</v>

48
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>They can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are at the gym going,</v>

50
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.060
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's in my left ear.</v>

51
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>So this is a collection of all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks,</v>

52
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>what has changed in the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoins.</v>

53
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>And so last time we spoke we spoke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hung out in Vegas,</v>

54
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>which was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time with you and um,</v>

55
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has changed in the world of bitcoin</v>

56
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.760
<v Speaker 1>since the last time?</v>

57
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a bout a year and a half</v>

58
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so much so much happening in the</v>

59
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:39.791
<v Speaker 2>meantime that we had a pretty slow 2015</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 2016 picked up again 2015 still</v>

60
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 2>coming off a slow and gradual drop in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the price.</v>

61
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 2>People were very reluctant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptical.</v>

62
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 2>The media was constantly bashing</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

63
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.140
<v Speaker 2>at the same time we saw this really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting phenomenon where the banks</v>

65
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 2>started getting interested in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

66
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

67
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.150
<v Speaker 3>not bitcoin itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

68
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 3>the blockchain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technology behind Bitcoin,</v>

69
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 3>which is rather amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

70
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 3>I look at that a bit as if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 3>the Horse Buggy Association of America</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going,</v>

72
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we like this automobile thing you've</v>

73
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 3>designed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have a very big investment in Hay</v>

74
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 3>and horses and stables and veterinarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to use the technology</v>

75
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 3>behind the automobile pneumatic tire and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to revolutionize horse</v>

76
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 3>buggies.</v>

77
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.160
<v Speaker 1>But in all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying,</v>

78
00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in all fairness,</v>

79
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird thing to invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to go all in on bitcoin.</v>

80
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you do it,</v>

81
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>but you also make all of your money this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and this is,</v>

82
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

83
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.130
<v Speaker 1>You're a proselytizing person when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to Bitcoin,</v>

84
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For good reason.</v>

85
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 1>But for the average person saves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved up actual cash money their whole</v>

86
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:59.520
<v Speaker 1>life and is involved in this established</v>
<v Speaker 1>system of money to throw all their money</v>

87
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 1>into bitcoin would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watched the money fluctuate,</v>

88
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 1>it goes up and it goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you said that,</v>

90
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>that it would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a terrible idea.</v>

91
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think that that's probably</v>

92
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:15.441
<v Speaker 1>why the media bashes it and why banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just looking at it going like people</v>

93
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>see that there's a growing number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are using it for</v>

94
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>transactions.</v>

95
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>There's Bitcoin ATM now and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it to to purchase things.</v>

96
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:27.660
<v Speaker 1>There's several companies that accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin for for products,</v>

97
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>for actual real physical products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

98
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's not an investment so it</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be treated as an investment.</v>

99
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean not don't even mean like as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>

100
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean as like a primary source array of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

101
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.140
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

102
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>of if you decided to take all of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

103
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>not as an investment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just say,</v>

104
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going going to live off a Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to spend bitcoin.</v>

105
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Much like your money's going to go up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and down.</v>

106
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to be really hard,</v>

107
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:58.910
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're accustomed to privileged</v>

108
00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:01.040
<v Speaker 3>banking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you have the kind of banking</v>

109
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 3>that we have in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you actually have access to that and</v>

110
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:09.611
<v Speaker 3>you have a a nice visa debit card and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't pay account fees and your</v>

111
00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:15.581
<v Speaker 3>money doesn't get confiscated by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictator too often and you know you can</v>

112
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 3>earn your money and interact with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

113
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.430
<v Speaker 3>then why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you use bitcoin?</v>

114
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.550
<v Speaker 3>The simple answer is that's not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>the use case,</v>

115
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 3>but there are lots of people around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world who simply don't have access to</v>

116
00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 3>that and for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

117
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.660
<v Speaker 3>in many cases bitcoin is the stable</v>
<v Speaker 3>currency,</v>

118
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask a,</v>

119
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.810
<v Speaker 3>an Argentinian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuelan,</v>

120
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Supriya to Greek and the list</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes on and on and on.</v>

121
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Whether they're worried about volatility</v>
<v Speaker 3>in bitcoin and in many cases if they've</v>

122
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.720
<v Speaker 3>heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they've used it,</v>

123
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.430
<v Speaker 3>that's the stable currency.</v>

124
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 3>They're national currency is far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far worse.</v>

125
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you say Brazil?</v>

126
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil has had a massive devaluation the</v>

127
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.010
<v Speaker 3>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much devaluation,</v>

128
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 3>because I know that they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced some sort of a really</v>

129
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 3>radical economic downturn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting because a</v>

130
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 3>few years ago when we first started</v>
<v Speaker 3>going into Brazil,</v>

131
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 3>their economy was booming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>W W we.</v>

132
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

133
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 3>they're at a currency crisis right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massive currency crisis.</v>

134
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

135
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 3>apart from the political crisis that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

136
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.260
<v Speaker 3>and I won't speak for that because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the Brazilian,</v>

137
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had impeachment proceedings.</v>

138
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 3>They just impeached their president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been a lot of economic</v>

139
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:29.170
<v Speaker 3>difficulty with the country and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

140
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>their currency has devalued almost 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent in the last year of 20 or 30</v>

141
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some staggering amount in currencies</v>

142
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 3>don't move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mainstream national currencies that have</v>

143
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 3>very large economies behind them simply</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't move like that.</v>

144
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 3>We've seen it happened only a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

145
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 3>We've seen it happening in Greece and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cyprus during the economic crisis.</v>

146
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.860
<v Speaker 3>We saw it happen in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

147
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 3>during brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've seen it in places like Brazil,</v>

148
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Argentina,</v>

149
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.300
<v Speaker 3>and places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much currency did,</v>

150
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 3>how much of a percentage of Britain you</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose during brexit?</v>

151
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Almost 20 percent in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And three things responded to.</v>

152
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 3>That's in the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gold,</v>

153
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese yen and bitcoin heading in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact opposite direction.</v>

154
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 3>A bitcoin climb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 percent that they almost really.</v>

155
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 3>So did Britain rebound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

156
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 3>it did a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still in historic,</v>

157
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 3>close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multi-decade lows.</v>

158
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 3>So they took a really big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we've seen again and again is</v>

159
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 3>at times of crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

160
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 3>we see this pattern repeating where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people use bitcoin as a safe haven</v>

161
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 3>investment to get money out of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>national currencies,</v>

162
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 3>especially where there are very strict</v>
<v Speaker 3>currency capital controls.</v>

163
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 3>So one of the reasons we've seen a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin,</v>

164
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 3>probably one of the reasons we've seen a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of activity with bitcoin in China is</v>

165
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 3>because of currency controls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time the yuan,</v>

166
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese currency devalues against</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dollar and it's done.</v>

167
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:04.841
<v Speaker 3>So I think four times in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time there was a massive uptick in</v>

168
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin buying in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people are parking their money in</v>

169
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin or using it to convert it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>other currencies and get money out of</v>

170
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the biggest fluctuation that</v>

171
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin has had?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

172
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

173
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 3>it depends whether you look at it on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>monetary basis or on a percentage basis.</v>

174
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the movements now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can go up 30,</v>

175
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even a hundred bucks in a day.</v>

176
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seems like a lot,</v>

177
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 3>but as a percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest fluctuations that had were</v>

178
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:39.900
<v Speaker 3>in 2010 and 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

179
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.390
<v Speaker 3>when it rose from under a dollar to over</v>
<v Speaker 3>$30 and then back down to under a dollar</v>

180
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 3>in a period of a couple of months.</v>

181
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 3>For people who don't understand what</v>
<v Speaker 3>this means when you're,</v>

182
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 3>when you're saying it a hundred bucks or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dollar $30.</v>

183
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that in relationship to one</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin,</v>

184
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.330
<v Speaker 3>one bitcoin equals $30 or in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does it equal right now?</v>

185
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred and 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred $17.</v>

186
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about $230 at the beginning of</v>

187
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.280
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've seen a massive ramp pop and a</v>

188
00:09:12.281 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 3>renewal of interest that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

189
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 3>so massive ramp up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like what's the fluctuation?</v>

190
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 3>So if it's at 616,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what you said?</v>

191
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tripled since the beginning of the</v>

192
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 3>year almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that it could drop to</v>

193
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 3>like 200 tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

194
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.940
<v Speaker 3>See that scares the shit out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

195
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and which is why,</v>

196
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

197
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 3>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the truth,</v>

198
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.170
<v Speaker 3>over the seven years that it's existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the volatility as a percentage has been</v>

199
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 3>going down every single here.</v>

200
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 3>So as the economy gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger it is,</v>

201
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 3>the more stable it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A doesn't get buffeted around,</v>

202
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a very large boats</v>

203
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.750
<v Speaker 3>doesn't get pushed around by the waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And bitcoin is like a Zodiac next to</v>

204
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:58.681
<v Speaker 3>theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s dollars,</v>

205
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:02.470
<v Speaker 3>titanic and the Little Zodiac is</v>
<v Speaker 3>bouncing up and down on the waves a lot.</v>

206
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 3>And it might be uncomfortable at times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

207
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 3>if you're heading to an iceberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be in the thing that can</v>

208
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 3>actually turn on a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to look at.</v>

209
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:14.080
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

210
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's a fair analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good way to look at.</v>

211
00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's volatile.</v>

212
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the fact that a 10 to</v>

213
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 3>$12,000,000,000 economy stretched across</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire globe is a small economy,</v>

214
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 3>is a currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in the interest of making this a</v>

215
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 3>standalone podcast.</v>

216
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So people are not going to go back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to all the other podcasts that</v>

217
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 3>we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain very briefly if you could,</v>

218
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 3>what is bitcoin and how does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I have this opportunity to do</v>

219
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 3>it again because every time we have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>new audience.</v>

220
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.230
<v Speaker 3>So bitcoin is internet money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a system of money that exists on</v>

221
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:49.200
<v Speaker 3>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was created on the Internet and it</v>

222
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 3>allows you to send and receive value the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same way you can send to receive an</v>

223
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 3>email anywhere in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously without intermediaries.</v>

224
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of what you see at first</v>

225
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Speaker 3>glance behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole platform.</v>

226
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 3>It is as the title of the books as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet of money.</v>

227
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a set of protocols that allow you</v>

228
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 3>to basically exchange value with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

229
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 3>But you can do a lot more with it than</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that.</v>

230
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Most people will use it as a currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically money that you can</v>

231
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 3>transmit from your smartphone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else's smartphone directly,</v>

232
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.950
<v Speaker 3>just like cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

233
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:33.050
<v Speaker 3>but electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about it that's unique is</v>

234
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 3>that it's not owned by any corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any bank or any government,</v>

235
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:42.831
<v Speaker 3>just like the web isn't owned by anyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>or email isn't owned by anyone.</v>

236
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 3>And there's lots of companies that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>send or receive email.</v>

237
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 3>There's also companies that can set up</v>
<v Speaker 3>websites.</v>

238
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of companies that can set</v>
<v Speaker 3>up applications that use bitcoin.</v>

239
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 3>And I should say that when you set it up</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

240
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 3>the first time you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people donated bitcoin.</v>

241
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 3>So what I did was I'd said whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>people donated,</v>

242
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I would match or I would double it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we would donate it to fight for</v>

243
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 3>the forgotten have build wells in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congo.</v>

244
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 3>And we built.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how many Justin Wren</v>

245
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:16.260
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was A.</v>

246
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember how much money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was many thousands of dollars.</v>

247
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 3>People donated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I doubled it and then we sent</v>

248
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 3>it over to the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the bitcoin community is very</v>

249
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 3>generous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is my point that that is true.</v>

250
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 3>And part of that generosity comes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that a lot of the people in</v>

251
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 3>this community are very excited about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this technology and want to share it</v>

252
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 3>with others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to tell other people about</v>

253
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 3>this technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really quite interesting what</v>

254
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 3>happens when you create a form of money</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is truly global.</v>

255
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 3>We really don't have forms of money that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are truly global.</v>

256
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 3>If you even even with your very advanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>banking system and your access to all of</v>

257
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 3>the technology that you have in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>American banking system.</v>

258
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 3>If you try to send money to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

259
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I experienced this every time I get</v>

260
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:06.610
<v Speaker 3>paid in Bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go into a conference in Europe,</v>

261
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll do one conference with the</v>

262
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 3>banking industry and one conference with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bitcoin community and the little</v>

263
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin conference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be free to attend and I</v>

264
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.330
<v Speaker 3>don't make any money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they sometimes cover some of my</v>

265
00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:25.331
<v Speaker 3>expenses and I'll send them an invoice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the banking industry conference will</v>

266
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 3>send me a wire transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes on average four weeks for me to</v>

267
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 3>get it with several calls to find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it went,</v>

268
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did it get lost?</v>

269
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 3>And it takes me on average 15 minutes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get paid in Bitcoin,</v>

270
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 3>no matter which country and being paid</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

271
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.200
<v Speaker 3>This is the cynic in me is this because</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they take the money and they're</v>

272
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 3>transferring it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're moving it around and now it's</v>

273
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 3>sitting in banks.</v>

274
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 3>When banks have money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they have your money,</v>

275
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>even if it's just for a few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the opportunity to use that</v>

276
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 3>money to make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they doing that?</v>

277
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

278
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 3>it certainly doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hurt to keep it a bit longer.</v>

279
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.450
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it primarily because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

280
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 3>because the system has a series of</v>
<v Speaker 3>intermediaries and each of those</v>

281
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 3>intermediaries represent a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If one of those intermediary says,</v>

282
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I have the money for Mr Antonopoulos</v>
<v Speaker 3>wire and you give that money to</v>

283
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Antonopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the intermediary doesn't give it to</v>

284
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out of money.</v>

285
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's those risks with every</v>

286
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 3>intermediate you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's risk.</v>

287
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's called counterparty risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The because of the way the banking</v>

288
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:34.750
<v Speaker 3>system is with perhaps five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

289
00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 3>seven intermediaries in a single</v>
<v Speaker 3>transfer,</v>

290
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that creates a lot of cumulative risk</v>

291
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:45.270
<v Speaker 3>and they protect with at risk by slowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things down and um,</v>

292
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 3>that risk doesn't exist in bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's from one party directly to</v>

293
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no counter parties.</v>

294
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the core principles.</v>

295
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this conversation with my bank</v>

296
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.310
<v Speaker 2>instead said I had done this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

297
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 2>conference in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankfurt at the headquarters of the</v>

298
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Bundesbank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

299
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.500
<v Speaker 2>for those of your viewers or listeners</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't know,</v>

300
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:11.501
<v Speaker 2>the Bundesbank is the Federal Bank of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and they probably consider the</v>

301
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:19.090
<v Speaker 2>United States Federal Reserve to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocre creditor compared to the</v>

302
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Bundesbank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like the best credit rating on</v>

303
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:25.640
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

304
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to speak at a conference</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they're paying me for my</v>

305
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:34.790
<v Speaker 2>expenses and they send a wire transfer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I call my bank and after four weeks</v>

306
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 2>they finally find it and tell me we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>received your bank,</v>

307
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 2>your bank wire transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to hold it.</v>

308
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the risk profile.</v>

309
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

310
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you haven't been paid by this particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>payer before,</v>

311
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.850
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to put a hold on it said</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do know this is the Bundesbank</v>

312
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 2>you are holding and they held it for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

313
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:03.251
<v Speaker 2>You are holding for two weeks because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the credit risk of the Federal Bank of</v>

314
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most credit worthy institution.</v>

315
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to receive money from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalia,</v>

316
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't even something weird.</v>

317
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if even they campaign me in the age of</v>

318
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 2>the Internet instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something wrong with this</v>

319
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 2>banking system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there is because I got paid for the</v>

320
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin conference was doing in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>town instantaneously.</v>

321
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>But there's also concern on their end</v>
<v Speaker 1>about fraud,</v>

322
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

323
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's fraud with bitcoin as well.</v>

324
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there,</v>

325
00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:40.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that issue with those guys that were</v>

326
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 1>investigating the dark web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that the agents were</v>

327
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 1>stealing bitcoin to the tune of hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of dollars.</v>

328
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that the case with.</v>

329
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

330
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.480
<v Speaker 2>So the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference is a difference between</v>

331
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.050
<v Speaker 2>systemic fraud and individual cases of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>

332
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm in Bitcoin as in the traditional</v>

333
00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:03.520
<v Speaker 2>banking system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

334
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.770
<v Speaker 2>if a bank or an organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrates a lot of money,</v>

335
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.790
<v Speaker 2>then you can go in and steal it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You basically robbed the Big Coin Bank</v>

336
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:15.150
<v Speaker 2>just like people rob the normal bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how would they do that?</v>

337
00:17:15.151 --> 00:17:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Just hack into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they hack in and they do it.</v>

338
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.040
<v Speaker 2>And this has happened many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

339
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:24.750
<v Speaker 2>And this is a problem with bitcoin banks</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to person to person</v>

340
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.100
<v Speaker 2>exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>

341
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Because the whole point of Bitcoin is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't need to put your money in</v>

342
00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:34.281
<v Speaker 2>the custody of someone else and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead you use bitcoin as it is</v>

343
00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.850
<v Speaker 2>intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everybody keeps control of their</v>

344
00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:41.460
<v Speaker 2>own money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then in order to hack all of those</v>

345
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:46.200
<v Speaker 2>people either have to hack the bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>protocol itself has not happened in</v>

346
00:17:46.201 --> 00:17:48.510
<v Speaker 2>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way it's structured is</v>

347
00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do or you</v>

348
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 3>have to hack each individual account</v>
<v Speaker 3>holder and you can hack individual</v>

349
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 3>account holders depending on their level</v>
<v Speaker 3>of security and sophistication.</v>

350
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.520
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

351
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get very large amounts you have to</v>

352
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 3>wait for them to give their money to</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else.</v>

353
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.360
<v Speaker 3>What was that exchange?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bitcoin bank that started off as</v>

354
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 3>like a fantasy website and some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that again?</v>

355
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a Mt.</v>

356
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Gox in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The magic,</v>

357
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 3>the gathering online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they see in the early days of</v>

358
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wouldn't know exchanges.</v>

359
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to think back like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember on the web,</v>

360
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the early days when even the largest,</v>

361
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 3>most sophisticated corporations had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>page with a single logon,</v>

362
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.870
<v Speaker 3>a gray background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some flashing lights that said under</v>

363
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:39.060
<v Speaker 3>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in 1994,</v>

364
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.640
<v Speaker 3>that's where we are in bitcoin's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

365
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.990
<v Speaker 3>there were no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

366
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 3>well run exchanges at the time.</v>

367
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 3>It was very difficult to buy and sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin.</v>

368
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.250
<v Speaker 3>And so this guy in Japan had a site that</v>
<v Speaker 3>could trade these magic,</v>

369
00:18:55.621 --> 00:19:00.621
<v Speaker 3>the gathering online cards and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he converted the site to trade</v>

370
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.130
<v Speaker 3>currencies instead to create trade</v>
<v Speaker 3>cryptocurrencies.</v>

371
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 3>It turns out it's a lot easier to hack</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and steal cryptocurrencies than it is</v>

372
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:12.150
<v Speaker 3>to steal the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever happened with that,</v>

373
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 3>because the story was like hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars in bitcoins,</v>

374
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:19.140
<v Speaker 3>just hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millions.</v>

375
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.050
<v Speaker 3>They didn't vanish that event or someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>stole it.</v>

376
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.650
<v Speaker 3>They got stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

377
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 3>they got cycled through the economy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're back in the economy now,</v>

378
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 3>but just not with the same owners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows who.</v>

379
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 3>No one knows who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems bizarre.</v>

380
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Like if you rob a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they can put a trace on the bills</v>

381
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 3>and they can figure it out eventually in</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people get caught,</v>

382
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

383
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

384
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:42.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

385
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

386
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:48.490
<v Speaker 3>if you do wire fraud perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in many cases with cash,</v>

387
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.450
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin is ly cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

388
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 3>it is equally untraceable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to actually catch</v>

389
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think recently,</v>

390
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:58.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading about the FBI closing the,</v>

391
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:01.980
<v Speaker 3>a db cooper case is the Guy who robbed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bank,</v>

392
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Speaker 3>got into seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one seven aircraft,</v>

393
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 3>opened the rear staircase and jumped out</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the parachutes over the midwest was</v>

394
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:12.620
<v Speaker 3>never seen again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

395
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that guy died though.</v>

396
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>

397
00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.750
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a convenient to</v>

398
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 3>explanation for the failure of the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 3>to catch him.</v>

399
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be convenient,</v>

400
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 3>but also didn't even like drop into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods.</v>

401
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.453
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

402
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the details.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never found him body or money ever</v>

403
00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that can happen pretty easy.</v>

404
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.970
<v Speaker 3>I would be more likely or more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

405
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 3>apt to believe that if someone dropped</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the woods,</v>

406
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:44.241
<v Speaker 3>out of a parachute with some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>haphazard gear and left out of the back</v>

407
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 3>of a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably died.</v>

408
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Probably got eaten by bears or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

409
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>

410
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.210
<v Speaker 3>or found by a local woodsmen and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cabin who's like some,</v>

411
00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.080
<v Speaker 3>some dude fell out of the sky with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satchel full of money from my money.</v>

412
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I need a new chainsaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

414
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Speaker 3>but when you're stealing money from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bank,</v>

415
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.390
<v Speaker 3>can't they trace the serial numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you steal cash,</v>

416
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 3>like if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

417
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:14.560
<v Speaker 3>this is a robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stick them up and he pointed gun at the</v>

418
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 3>tower and they fill up the bag with</v>
<v Speaker 3>currency and you run out the door.</v>

419
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Don't they have like a trace on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>money like where they can if you spend</v>

420
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 3>the cash?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

421
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.281
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

422
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 3>And they can't because they have all</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of.</v>

423
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

424
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 3>if they had a batch of sequentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbered clean money,</v>

425
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not how most banks work.</v>

426
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 3>What the money they have on hand is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that came to positive did in the</v>

427
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 3>last week by various people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cash businesses like Delis and grocery</v>

428
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 3>stores and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have no idea what the numbers</v>

429
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.220
<v Speaker 3>on those bills are and they don't trace</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

430
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 3>It's simply considered part of the risk</v>
<v Speaker 3>of business.</v>

431
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 3>And what does this avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deb Cooper's money before.</v>

432
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them get this out of the left</v>

433
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:03.280
<v Speaker 3>side of my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bad cable after reset.</v>

434
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No sign of DB.</v>

435
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Cooper ever emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Investigators doubt he survived and</v>

436
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 3>never been able to determine his true</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>

437
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:14.260
<v Speaker 3>but a boy digging on the Columbia River</v>
<v Speaker 3>beach in 1980 found three bundles of</v>

438
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 3>weathered $20 bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cooper's cash according to the serial</v>

439
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's dead as fuck.</v>

440
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.130
<v Speaker 3>They found his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of his money.</v>

441
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Was he like left of because being</v>
<v Speaker 3>sneaky,</v>

442
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pretend I'm done.</v>

443
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm just leave some of those fears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

444
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.400
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only found like a very.</v>

445
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they recovered more than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny fraction of it.</v>

446
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

447
00:22:35.701 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember the details always</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing like 200 grand though.</v>

448
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it was only like $200,000 or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

449
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 3>In those days you could pay the national</v>
<v Speaker 3>debt with that kind of money.</v>

450
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Speaker 3>What year was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sixties,</v>

451
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.490
<v Speaker 3>71.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of money in those days.</v>

452
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 3>That DB Cooper store is an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

453
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.440
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love a story like that when</v>

454
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.350
<v Speaker 3>people don't get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

455
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:59.590
<v Speaker 3>The mystery of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the Mt.</v>

456
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Gox thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exchange is kind of a mystery to.</v>

457
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a $100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollar.</v>

458
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Many hundreds of millions of dollar</v>
<v Speaker 3>mystery inside story of Mt.</v>

459
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Gox bitcoins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred $60.</v>

460
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Billion dollar disaster for 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that guy.</v>

461
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 3>They're leading them around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Martin who is a.</v>

462
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the guy who is now out on parole.</v>

463
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I believe four on or pending trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that guy's out $460,</v>

464
00:23:23.921 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>million dollars and he's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

465
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:26.800
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

466
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 3>is he responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because he's retarded,</v>

467
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things we don't know</v>

468
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:38.220
<v Speaker 3>and maybe we'll never know how much of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that responsibility,</v>

469
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 3>whether it was deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was an inside job,</v>

470
00:23:40.301 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 3>whether it was a in something in</v>
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

471
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was certainly.</v>

472
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 3>That was an enormous amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>incompetent.</v>

473
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 3>That's clear.</v>

474
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you listened to him talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him in speeches when he's</v>

475
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 1>discussing the issue of you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

476
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.043
<v Speaker 1>that guy</v>

477
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.453
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

478
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.260
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you heard Bernie madoff talk?</v>

479
00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

480
00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

481
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:00.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is the,</v>

482
00:24:00.781 --> 00:24:01.860
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the most.</v>

483
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.030
<v Speaker 3>And the interesting thing is that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to the day before Bernie madoff was</v>

484
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.140
<v Speaker 3>indicted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indicted,</v>

485
00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:10.710
<v Speaker 3>he was the top trusted name on Wall</v>
<v Speaker 3>Street.</v>

486
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.270
<v Speaker 3>He had the most stellar credit rating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the head of the credit rating</v>

487
00:24:15.271 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 3>agency for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

488
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.500
<v Speaker 3>those types of funds that he was rated</v>
<v Speaker 3>under.</v>

489
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the next day he's a CROC.</v>

490
00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:26.040
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see these things happen</v>

491
00:24:26.041 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 3>throughout human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the changing the form of money you used</v>

492
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:33.270
<v Speaker 3>doesn't change that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he changed the architecture of</v>

493
00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:36.070
<v Speaker 3>money and you make it less necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

494
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 3>and I'm less useful to concentrate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>money in the hands of third parties that</v>

495
00:24:42.691 --> 00:24:44.350
<v Speaker 3>has an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that</v>

496
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.620
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the issues with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like Mt Gox or with any</v>

497
00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:48.490
<v Speaker 1>banking system.</v>

498
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than the bitcoin system.</v>

499
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.650
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

500
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is the counterparty risk.</v>

501
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:57.830
<v Speaker 3>If you give your money to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire reason we have oversight in</v>

502
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 3>banking is because of the simple truth</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you give your money to other</v>

503
00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually they'll try to steal it.</v>

504
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.190
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason they,</v>

505
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 3>they don't get someone in the bank is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have a tremendous need.</v>

506
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 3>The tremendous gambling problem and</v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction something,</v>

507
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or just have a lack of empathy in and</v>

508
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 3>social socialization and just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

509
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crooked,</v>

510
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 3>but they don't even have to be crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can make a mistake and trading and</v>

511
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 3>tried to cover it up with customer</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

512
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.130
<v Speaker 3>They can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

513
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.630
<v Speaker 3>debts there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their parent may require an expensive</v>

514
00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 3>surgery that they can't afford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of reasons why people</v>

515
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 3>commit financial fraud and not all of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because they're just greedy,</v>

516
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:45.180
<v Speaker 3>evil assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

517
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is that all of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>oversight system we have in banking,</v>

518
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:54.340
<v Speaker 3>which by the way fails again and again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again and again to protect and</v>

519
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 3>regular people from these thefts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of these systems we have exists for</v>

520
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 3>that one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the answer is not build better</v>

521
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 3>systems to watch the people who hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>your money.</v>

522
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.320
<v Speaker 3>The answer that bitcoin gives us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let others hold your money,</v>

523
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 3>hold your own money and then you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this problem.</v>

524
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.710
<v Speaker 3>There was recent</v>

525
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 1>investigative report about a firm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>

526
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it's Atlanta that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously high rate of success with</v>

527
00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:29.721
<v Speaker 1>investments and they interviewed the Guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who runs it and you know his reasons for</v>

528
00:26:31.321 --> 00:26:35.310
<v Speaker 1>why they're so wildly successful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make so much more money than</v>

529
00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:38.310
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very suspect and they're closing</v>

530
00:26:38.311 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Speaker 1>in on this guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on over here?</v>

531
00:26:40.531 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And they think that not only is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie model,</v>

532
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.910
<v Speaker 1>not just Bernie Madoff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

533
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 1>they think that it's common and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that might be</v>

534
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 1>supplementing legitimate investments</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a pyramid scheme and that it's been</v>

535
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.030
<v Speaker 1>a standard operational model for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these firms because they've been able</v>

536
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:00.864
<v Speaker 1>to pull it off.</v>

537
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:06.230
<v Speaker 2>What we've seen again and again</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history in the area of</v>

538
00:27:06.231 --> 00:27:10.430
<v Speaker 2>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when there's a recession,</v>

539
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:15.490
<v Speaker 2>when there is a drop in income and</v>
<v Speaker 2>profitability for everyone,</v>

540
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that event is actually really good for</v>

541
00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:20.660
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it washes out the</v>

542
00:27:20.661 --> 00:27:23.060
<v Speaker 2>frauds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It washes out the failures,</v>

543
00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:25.340
<v Speaker 2>it washes out the unprofitable</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses.</v>

544
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a great cleansing event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

545
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Because the tide recedes and suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see who's not wearing swimming</v>

546
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:37.400
<v Speaker 2>trunks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we knew there was something fishy</v>

547
00:27:37.401 --> 00:27:39.020
<v Speaker 2>going on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

548
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that happens in,</v>

549
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.370
<v Speaker 2>in Wall Street's all of those companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were simply reinvesting the recent</v>

550
00:27:48.531 --> 00:27:52.790
<v Speaker 2>gains to pay the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>withdrawing their money or the retirees</v>

551
00:27:52.791 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 2>that are supporting in their pension</v>
<v Speaker 2>funds,</v>

552
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:55.760
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly they don't.</v>

553
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.610
<v Speaker 2>They can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're washed out of the business.</v>

554
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.390
<v Speaker 2>A badly performing businesses on</v>
<v Speaker 2>profitable.</v>

555
00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:07.391
<v Speaker 2>As all of these things get washed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't been doing this in this</v>

556
00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:11.900
<v Speaker 2>country for the last three decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead what happens is every time</v>

557
00:28:11.901 --> 00:28:16.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a recession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fed steps in a or the government</v>

558
00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:20.450
<v Speaker 2>steps in and basically they pump water</v>
<v Speaker 2>to raise the tide again.</v>

559
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as possible,</v>

560
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.750
<v Speaker 2>and that means that a lot of the crux</v>
<v Speaker 2>float from recession to recession</v>

561
00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:31.751
<v Speaker 2>without getting revealed worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it encourages that kind of behavior.</v>

562
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.420
<v Speaker 2>And so you get all of these businesses</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose only ability to make profits is</v>

563
00:28:37.641 --> 00:28:41.570
<v Speaker 2>when the interest rates to zero and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>$20 million dollars a month being</v>

564
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:46.571
<v Speaker 2>injected by the Fed and their business</v>
<v Speaker 2>model is take that and lend it to</v>

565
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:52.060
<v Speaker 2>consumers for 29 99 Apr Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do payday loans or subprime loans or</v>

566
00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:56.450
<v Speaker 2>subprime auto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>student loans,</v>

567
00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:57.740
<v Speaker 2>mortgages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. Etc.</v>

568
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.960
<v Speaker 2>You nEed a cleansing events to wash out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fraud.</v>

569
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

570
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I liked the example of a forest fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you suppress all of the small fires</v>

571
00:29:08.991 --> 00:29:11.450
<v Speaker 2>will happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is eventually you build up a lot of</v>

572
00:29:11.451 --> 00:29:15.500
<v Speaker 2>undergrowth in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A small fire doesn't kill the trees.</v>

573
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.820
<v Speaker 2>It just cleans out the undergrowth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep putting out the fires,</v>

574
00:29:19.821 --> 00:29:22.040
<v Speaker 2>which we've seen since the seventies</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the states.</v>

575
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You let all of the undergrowth grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when a fire comes through,</v>

576
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a little forest fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a raging inferno.</v>

577
00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't put it out and it burns the</v>

578
00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:36.860
<v Speaker 2>trees and destroys the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sterilizes the top foot of soil.</v>

579
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 2>We've seen this happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

580
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And so this is now happening in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our economy,</v>

581
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.930
<v Speaker 2>which is that all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

582
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 2>bible creation doesn't get washed out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recession.</v>

583
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.080
<v Speaker 2>More stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more funding.</v>

584
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.420
<v Speaker 2>The federal reserve pumping more money</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the economy.</v>

585
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 2>Trillions of dollars since 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of this stimulus,</v>

586
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 2>where does it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes into inflating not one bubble.</v>

587
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 2>We had real estates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we have real estate and subprime</v>

588
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:12.001
<v Speaker 2>auto and student loans and and and and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bonds and stocks and currencies all</v>

589
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 2>inflating at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to do a controlled burn</v>

590
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 2>for the economy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what they're doing in some</v>

591
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 2>places where they want to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue that you're talking about how</v>

592
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Speaker 2>there's stop forest fires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's theoretically part of the mandate</v>

593
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 2>of the federal reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most people don't realize is a</v>

594
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 2>private corporation owned by the banks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not a government agency.</v>

595
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tricky name.</v>

596
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

597
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Federal reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has nothing to do with that.</v>

598
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.200
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

600
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:49.030
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't name say my pUblishing company</v>

601
00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:49.861
<v Speaker 2>for the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

602
00:30:49.861 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal publIsher.</v>

603
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 2>They won't allow me to put the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal in the name of my company as</v>

604
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.390
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

605
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 2>But in order to create an organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

606
00:31:00.971 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 2>you need an act of congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

607
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 2>actually what you need as an act of</v>
<v Speaker 2>congress passed in the middle of the</v>

608
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.560
<v Speaker 2>night on a recess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly how they passed the</v>

609
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 2>federal reserve act in 1913.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a long ass time ago.</v>

610
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep that name,</v>

611
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:17.350
<v Speaker 2>but there is federal ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just say that you could buy</v>

612
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 2>bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Company called federal ammunition,</v>

613
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.890
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government interest is to good good</v>

614
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.490
<v Speaker 2>company to buy bullets from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

615
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 2>just seems like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The controlled burn idea.</v>

616
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 2>How would you apply that to the economy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

617
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:37.000
<v Speaker 2>if what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise the interest rates.</v>

618
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.080
<v Speaker 2>You raised them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

619
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drains the drains.</v>

620
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 2>The swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raised the interest rates.</v>

621
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Basically the interest rate controls the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost of money.</v>

622
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:51.361
<v Speaker 2>If you make money more expensive than</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who borrow have to have a pretty</v>

623
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:55.630
<v Speaker 2>good rate of investment return on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment to invest that.</v>

624
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they don't borrow money.</v>

625
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 2>That's an extremely unpopular idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

626
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get that across?</v>

627
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an.</v>

628
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:06.630
<v Speaker 2>It's an unpopular idea because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits savers instead of debtors.</v>

629
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

630
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:13.090
<v Speaker 2>if you have savings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great idea.</v>

631
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I remember a time when I could get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certificate of deposit for my savings in</v>

632
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:19.150
<v Speaker 2>the bank and I could get three percent a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

633
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.730
<v Speaker 2>three percent a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

634
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't get point three percent now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So savers get wIped out.</v>

635
00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 2>If you're a retiree who's got all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their money in savings right now,</v>

636
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 2>the return you're getting on those</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings isn't enough to cover your cost</v>

637
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 2>of living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your money basically is shrinking and</v>

638
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:40.610
<v Speaker 2>that's a tax on savers that benefits</v>

639
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 1>debtors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially very large debtors like the</v>

640
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:45.260
<v Speaker 1>federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 1>It's such a complicated system that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person is working all day</v>

642
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get home,</v>

643
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you have hobbies and family and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want to do.</v>

644
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to get a grip on</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how money works.</v>

645
00:32:59.240 --> 00:32:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

646
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of those,</v>

647
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 2>the things I found through my</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences doing these talks that I do,</v>

648
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about that in the book too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the whole point of this particular</v>

649
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 2>book of the internet of money is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and I talk about the philosophy</v>

650
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:14.071
<v Speaker 2>behind money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

651
00:33:14.071 --> 00:33:17.750
<v Speaker 2>the topics of money that most people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

652
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.460
<v Speaker 2>And what's really astonishing is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I am and I'm talking about the</v>

653
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 2>greatest experiment in money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

654
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 2>started in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2009.</v>

655
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.660
<v Speaker 2>And this great experiment is completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented in the history of money.</v>

656
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about 22 central banks</v>

657
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously taking their interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate to zero and pumping the largest</v>

658
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money ever created into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world economy,</v>

659
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:51.080
<v Speaker 2>trying to stop it from collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has created the largest bubble</v>

660
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:54.920
<v Speaker 2>in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the weird thing is that most people</v>

661
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 2>are not even aware that they're living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a time where we're doing this</v>

662
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 2>completely unprecedented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>untested.</v>

663
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 2>No one knows where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge monetary experiments in which 2</v>

664
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 2>billion people are hostage as part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

665
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

666
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.100
<v Speaker 2>and nobody knows where this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

667
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:16.340
<v Speaker 2>but most economists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream economists say,</v>

668
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:20.000
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't end well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean though?</v>

669
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 2>And then we have the other lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monetary experiments,</v>

670
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:23.414
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

671
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 2>money on the internet with a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 2>issuance,</v>

672
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.260
<v Speaker 2>only a certain amount of the money is</v>
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>

673
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 2>It's controlled by a mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 2>formula.</v>

674
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:36.320
<v Speaker 2>You can't make more and as a result it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a stable</v>

675
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.390
<v Speaker 1>ply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sound money and it cannot be</v>

676
00:34:40.391 --> 00:34:42.700
<v Speaker 1>manipulated by governments or banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

677
00:34:42.701 --> 00:34:47.680
<v Speaker 1>It's so confusing for anyone as it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get into the issue of what is</v>

678
00:34:47.681 --> 00:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>money and where's money coming from and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does the federal reserve,</v>

679
00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 1>how does the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does anybody create more money?</v>

680
00:34:54.611 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 1>How do you print more money and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are printing more money,</v>

681
00:34:57.491 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 1>where's it coming from and what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debt.</v>

682
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is it like?</v>

683
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:06.220
<v Speaker 1>What is it used to be gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be the gold standard.</v>

684
00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:08.340
<v Speaker 1>It used to be if you had a dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dollar's worth of gold,</v>

685
00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:11.320
<v Speaker 1>it was a note that was worth a dollar's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of gold.</v>

686
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That made sense.</v>

687
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.193
<v Speaker 1>And that stopped</v>

688
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 2>first stopped in 1936,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

689
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 2>bretton woods agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it stopped completely in 1971.</v>

690
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 2>when nixon closed the gold window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he basically said,</v>

691
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 2>if anyone comes to your bank and gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>you one silver dollar,</v>

692
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 2>a one gold dollar and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my silver,</v>

693
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 2>you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and basically defaulted on the backing</v>

694
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.050
<v Speaker 2>of us dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buy gold.</v>

695
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I met this wacky guy</v>

696
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

697
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 2>he was coming around the comedy store's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this really odd guy for a bunch of</v>

698
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

699
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things is he cArried a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun everywhere he went and he believed</v>

700
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:57.020
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believed in precious gold coins that</v>

701
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:02.151
<v Speaker 2>were minted outside of the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and using those as currency.</v>

702
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he would have these coins that he</v>

703
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:05.701
<v Speaker 2>carried with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

704
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:08.160
<v Speaker 2>And we try to pay for things in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>coins,</v>

705
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 2>like gold and silver coins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly silver.</v>

706
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 2>It's silver coins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was trying to explain to me that</v>

707
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:16.570
<v Speaker 2>this is legal and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

708
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.490
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to accept these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very weird stuff.</v>

709
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very odd.</v>

710
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:24.510
<v Speaker 2>He was very annoying too because one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys,</v>

711
00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>they like talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept touching you would talk to you</v>

712
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.110
<v Speaker 2>and like hold you.</v>

713
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.450
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like grab your arm and hold you and</v>

714
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.710
<v Speaker 2>touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all right fucker.</v>

715
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 2>What are you here here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A control freak.</v>

716
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 2>A weird control freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

717
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.260
<v Speaker 2>if someone's saying something to you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are holding onto you while they're</v>

718
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 2>saying that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're in love with them,</v>

719
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you creates a very strange moment.</v>

720
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Why are you holdIng me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I get loose here?</v>

721
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.850
<v Speaker 2>What if I have to run away real quick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to break this grip?</v>

722
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.300
<v Speaker 2>But this guy used to carry these coins</v>
<v Speaker 2>around with them.</v>

723
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking sack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes to touch his money.</v>

724
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Elvis off commercials and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

725
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 2>No man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like some weird fucking coin</v>

726
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:03.470
<v Speaker 2>with like an american eagle on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

727
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

728
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.680
<v Speaker 2>They're not weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're minted in the u.</v>

729
00:37:08.681 --> 00:37:11.240
<v Speaker 2>S full silver coins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're weirdest.</v>

730
00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.120
<v Speaker 2>Fuck their weird if he tried to use them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy a coffee.</v>

731
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Although a lot of people buy these and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold coins and small gold bars as</v>

732
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>investments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep them in a safe.</v>

733
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is if there is a</v>

734
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:29.561
<v Speaker 2>significant crash in the car and seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then these have holding value,</v>

735
00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not.</v>

736
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.320
<v Speaker 2>It's I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly sane to say if you have some</v>

737
00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:39.200
<v Speaker 2>money put aside in savings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't put it all in stocks.</v>

738
00:37:39.201 --> 00:37:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe diversify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a bit in precious metals,</v>

739
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:45.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe put a bit in digital currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe put a bit in commodities and other</v>

740
00:37:45.531 --> 00:37:49.010
<v Speaker 2>things that's kind of reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing.</v>

741
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.370
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the people who have these kinds</v>

742
00:37:52.371 --> 00:37:57.371
<v Speaker 2>of attitudes come from families and from</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures where there has been the time</v>

743
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:01.850
<v Speaker 2>in the past two generations where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave in the middle of the night with</v>

744
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.880
<v Speaker 2>all of your belongings in a pillowcase</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with people with guns and dogs after</v>

745
00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:08.720
<v Speaker 2>you trying to murder you.</v>

746
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.320
<v Speaker 2>And this happens today in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

747
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens one generation to go to my</v>

748
00:38:16.371 --> 00:38:20.000
<v Speaker 2>parents' generation in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Greece with the nazis,</v>

749
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:26.150
<v Speaker 2>and it happens to the russian people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to people all over the world.</v>

750
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

751
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.970
<v Speaker 2>it's really close when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is generation before,</v>

752
00:38:31.971 --> 00:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents tell you the stories.</v>

753
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different feeling.</v>

754
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't happened to most americans in</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least two or three generations.</v>

755
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 2>But when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you put in the pillowcase?</v>

756
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pieces of paper are worthless when</v>

757
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why some people do want to</v>

758
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 2>have physical coin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

759
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:59.101
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we've noticed now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that digital currencies may start to</v>

760
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:02.130
<v Speaker 2>serve a role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

761
00:39:02.131 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is that you can memorize 12</v>

762
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 2>english words and carry your entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin wallets in your head.</v>

763
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you 12 english words.</v>

764
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 2>What are those words?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Celsion party on?</v>

765
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

766
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can generate a bitcoin wallet,</v>

767
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then make a backup of it.</v>

768
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 2>And for convenience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the inventors and the space</v>

769
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 2>developed a system where you can back up</v>
<v Speaker 2>any bitcoin wallet,</v>

770
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 2>even if it has millions and billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>transactions and assets in it,</v>

771
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:37.750
<v Speaker 2>you can back it up to between 12 and 24</v>
<v Speaker 2>english words that are generated</v>

772
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:39.790
<v Speaker 2>automatically by the program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can</v>

773
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 1>be like that speech and pulp fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Samuel Jackson pulls a gun on that</v>

774
00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:46.510
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be your password.</v>

775
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't pick the words though.</v>

776
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't pick the words.</v>

777
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a series of words</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to be a,</v>

778
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asparagus,</v>

779
00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 2>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a attorney,</v>

780
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:00.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>

781
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I like dick's please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit on my head.</v>

782
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sentences and no words like that.</v>

783
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:12.330
<v Speaker 2>But think about the power of being able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to transport an unlimited amounts of</v>

784
00:40:12.331 --> 00:40:16.020
<v Speaker 2>money simply by memorizing 12 words that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be confiscated from you when</v>

785
00:40:16.021 --> 00:40:16.710
<v Speaker 2>you're a refugee.</v>

786
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

787
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:21.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea behind it is incredibly</v>

788
00:40:21.661 --> 00:40:25.020
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been a fan of it since the time</v>

789
00:40:25.021 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I met you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before that I was reasonably</v>

790
00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:31.080
<v Speaker 1>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course having you illuminated and</v>

791
00:40:31.081 --> 00:40:34.970
<v Speaker 1>such a great way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really made it much more,</v>

792
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more enticing and much more</v>

793
00:40:36.661 --> 00:40:41.661
<v Speaker 1>interesting and I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious from that point on as to</v>

794
00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:43.680
<v Speaker 1>where it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

795
00:40:43.681 --> 00:40:44.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

796
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at the landscape of money</v>

797
00:40:49.621 --> 00:40:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and I look at the landscape of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are willing to make this leap.</v>

798
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it would take to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>people fully onboard with bitcoin,</v>

799
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but I believe like you do that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system that we have now,</v>

800
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:06.270
<v Speaker 1>the banking system is incredibly corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just bizarre</v>

801
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and fragile and fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the thing that most</v>

802
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 2>people are missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks giant imposing.</v>

803
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.700
<v Speaker 2>It's been there for a century that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a sign of strength.</v>

804
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:23.310
<v Speaker 1>You find that the company in atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has this massive return on your</v>

805
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>investment that's being investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I found the right guy</v>

806
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

807
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.364
<v Speaker 1>I'll look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look again,</v>

808
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.453
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

809
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be a bunch of those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there that are doing that,</v>

810
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

811
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.330
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

812
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.500
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of um,</v>

813
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.440
<v Speaker 2>a system like that which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very opaque,</v>

814
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 2>which most people don't understand is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of system you want to corrupt</v>

815
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 2>because that's where you can make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most money without anybody noticing.</v>

816
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.993
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

817
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 2>financial crime is not really prosecuted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

818
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2008 giants crisis,</v>

819
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 2>millions of homeowners kicked out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their homes,</v>

820
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:04.940
<v Speaker 2>illegal foreclosures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>robo signing,</v>

821
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:05.661
<v Speaker 2>mills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

822
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:05.871
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

823
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only person who went to jail,</v>

824
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.890
<v Speaker 2>bernie madoff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who stole from the rich,</v>

825
00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everybody else,</v>

826
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.410
<v Speaker 2>scott free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was pretty interesting.</v>

827
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:17.270
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he was just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>scapegoat.</v>

828
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was obviously a crook.</v>

829
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 2>He was obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was obviously a crook,</v>

830
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:26.771
<v Speaker 2>but in sociopath or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by hundreds and hundreds and</v>

831
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.980
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of books in the same scale and</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant investment banks that are just as</v>

832
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.920
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and we don't see that right.</v>

833
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.270
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get,</v>

834
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you can get pulled over for a busted</v>
<v Speaker 2>tail light and thrown in jail in plenty</v>

835
00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 2>of the states in this country for six</v>
<v Speaker 2>months for having an herb in your car.</v>

836
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 2>And aT the same time you can put a</v>
<v Speaker 2>million people out of their homes</v>

837
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 2>through straight up fraud with mountains</v>
<v Speaker 2>of evidence and emails and things like</v>

838
00:42:56.121 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're untouchable.</v>

839
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 2>That system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem isn't the fact that there's</v>

840
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.960
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that the system itself is</v>

841
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 2>fragile because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it was just them going out of</v>

842
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the fragile system has problems,</v>

843
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 2>when it has hiccups as it did in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>

844
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just them going out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

845
00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 2>It's a generation of kids who leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>college with nothing waiting for all of</v>

846
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a job.</v>

847
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

848
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.630
<v Speaker 2>coming into a generation where their</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents could get by with one income and</v>

849
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:40.871
<v Speaker 2>a household and now three jobs each in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>household of two.</v>

850
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 2>And you can't afford to buy a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone a house.</v>

851
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're part of the new sharing</v>

852
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is the sharing economy?</v>

853
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:49.310
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tone anything because I can't</v>

854
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:54.311
<v Speaker 2>afford anything economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that whole generation is now</v>

855
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>suffering because of that fragility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system and the fragility hasn't gone</v>

856
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.740
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to dwell too much on</v>

857
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

858
00:44:04.821 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that I find positive and</v>

859
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:13.601
<v Speaker 2>interesting about bitcoin is that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>serves a global society.</v>

860
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 2>It is truly global traNsnational money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of places in the world</v>

861
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:20.840
<v Speaker 2>that have it worse than the u.</v>
<v Speaker 2>S there's some places that have it</v>

862
00:44:20.841 --> 00:44:22.640
<v Speaker 2>better financiallY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

863
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:27.140
<v Speaker 2>but it really is quite an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept to be able to have this money</v>

864
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:32.141
<v Speaker 2>that can operate on a global basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with that the opportunities to a buy</v>

865
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:40.131
<v Speaker 2>and sell and trade and invest and borrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally.</v>

866
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 2>The fact that what we did with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundraising here to fundraise for those</v>

867
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

868
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if that was just people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the us donating.</v>

869
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.850
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can guarantee you there were people</v>

870
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:58.110
<v Speaker 2>from all over the world donating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost impossible to do with</v>

871
00:44:58.111 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 2>traditional payment systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have sent that money directly</v>

872
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 2>to where the wells were being built</v>
<v Speaker 2>again anywhere in the world,</v>

873
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's really exciting to me.</v>

874
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.430
<v Speaker 2>People are uncomfortable with bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it represents changing one of</v>

875
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental ancient technologies of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization money and we've only</v>

876
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 2>changed that technology four or five</v>
<v Speaker 2>times in the history of human</v>

877
00:45:25.891 --> 00:45:30.420
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've gone from bare bones,</v>

878
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 2>barter systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a goat,</v>

879
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:37.341
<v Speaker 2>give me three chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to systems of precious metals</v>

880
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 2>and other nice objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feathers,</v>

881
00:45:42.871 --> 00:45:45.960
<v Speaker 2>shells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. To excluSively precious metals to a</v>

882
00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 2>precious metal stamped with the faces of</v>
<v Speaker 2>kings,</v>

883
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.150
<v Speaker 2>and then at some point around the 15th</v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

884
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you start seeing certificates of deposit</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

885
00:45:57.201 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 2>for precious metal being exchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paper notes that I have a deposit of</v>

886
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 2>gold there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to move the gold from my</v>

887
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 2>deposit to your deposit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just give you the piece of paper</v>

888
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:11.301
<v Speaker 2>that says you're now the owner and paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>money is introduced and then plastic in</v>

889
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 2>the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a diner's club,</v>

890
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.600
<v Speaker 2>a traveler's checks and the first credit</v>
<v Speaker 2>cards,</v>

891
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.540
<v Speaker 2>and if you think any of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>transitions were smooth,</v>

892
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 2>none of them were smooth.</v>

893
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 2>You go to someone who's been using</v>
<v Speaker 2>precious metals for 10 generations and</v>

894
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:27.744
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

895
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 2>this piece of paper is money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

896
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 2>give me something shiny that I can bite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's money that this paper,</v>

897
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go away.</v>

898
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.640
<v Speaker 2>How long has that transitioned?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For?</v>

899
00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:45.550
<v Speaker 2>A hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

900
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Until broad acceptance of paper money</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 100 years with huge resistance.</v>

901
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.430
<v Speaker 2>It took almost 40 years for credit cards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go mainstream.</v>

902
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 2>With bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do it probably in less</v>

903
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.890
<v Speaker 2>than 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think so,</v>

904
00:46:58.891 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but it was almost 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's seven.</v>

905
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

906
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's accelerating very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in some countries you're going</v>

907
00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:10.671
<v Speaker 2>to see either bitcoin or cryptocurrency</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar or based on bitcoin be used</v>

908
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:17.150
<v Speaker 2>as commonly as a national currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not looking to displace national</v>

909
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 2>currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking to supplement them.</v>

910
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea being that people will</v>
<v Speaker 2>get comfortable using multiple</v>

911
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:27.360
<v Speaker 2>currencies just like many places they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

912
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

913
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 2>between the border of Kenya and Tanzania</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

914
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to use for</v>
<v Speaker 2>different currencies,</v>

915
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 2>kenyan money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania in us dollars and euros easily.</v>

916
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Possibly also south african rand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got four or five currencies,</v>

917
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.540
<v Speaker 2>you can stop at a four year old in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>streets and ask them what the exchange</v>

918
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 2>rate is and they'll tell you right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they trade for their parents and</v>

919
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 2>merchant stalls along the border and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have people come in with all kinds</v>

920
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:00.970
<v Speaker 2>of different currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that difficult to assume that</v>

921
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:02.890
<v Speaker 2>there's digital currencies in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

922
00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:08.070
<v Speaker 2>either there or in a major modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>metropolis Where people are using</v>

923
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.310
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin to transact online to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

924
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 2>virtual things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a music video,</v>

925
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.950
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want to make very,</v>

926
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 2>very small payments with credit cards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not suitable and use bitcoin as well</v>

927
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 2>as their normal currencies.</v>

928
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 2>What is the progress it makes you so</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic?</v>

929
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could point to any one thing or</v>

930
00:48:29.891 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 2>several things that make you optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>about bitcoin's future?</v>

931
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think watching it as,</v>

932
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>as a computer scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a technologist,</v>

933
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I look at this and I see innovation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is accelerating and I see much of the</v>

934
00:48:45.491 --> 00:48:50.491
<v Speaker 2>early vision opening up the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing things that are so far outside.</v>

935
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 2>What we could do with traditional money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

936
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it often blows my mind,</v>

937
00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a technology that's being introduced</v>

938
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 2>into bitcoin now is called payment</v>
<v Speaker 2>channels.</v>

939
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>And what it allows you to do is to do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high volume of small transactions</v>

940
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.580
<v Speaker 2>at a very rapid rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say your,</v>

941
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 2>you want to watch a video and you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay the owner of that video to send</v>

942
00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:21.844
<v Speaker 2>it to you.</v>

943
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about paying by the second.</v>

944
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.760
<v Speaker 2>And so you say you set up basically an</v>
<v Speaker 2>account and you pay by every second of</v>

945
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:32.470
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe every fifth of a second,</v>

946
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 2>200 milliseconds of video at a time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying a fraction that is a</v>

947
00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:42.571
<v Speaker 2>thousandth of a penny and you keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching video and paying a thousandth</v>

948
00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:47.710
<v Speaker 2>of a penny for every fifth of a second</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this drip metered basis.</v>

949
00:49:47.711 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing it.</v>

950
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 2>You're a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Software is doing it,</v>

951
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.750
<v Speaker 2>communicating with our computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>software.</v>

952
00:49:52.751 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 2>And now you can do this really</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible thing.</v>

953
00:49:56.261 --> 00:49:58.960
<v Speaker 2>You can pay for content what it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually worth.</v>

954
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the thresholds for a payment on</v>

955
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 2>a credit card is two to $3,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're apple and you're doing</v>

956
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>billions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you can take it down to</v>

957
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 2>ninety nine cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about the lowest you can go.</v>

958
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.460
<v Speaker 2>So meaning watching something on youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some similar video streaming device,</v>

959
00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you would have to pay service rather.</v>

960
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.110
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would pay a very minuscule</v>

961
00:50:20.111 --> 00:50:20.944
<v Speaker 2>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

962
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whAt are you talking about a couple</v>

963
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:24.690
<v Speaker 2>of cents like to watch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

964
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:29.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally mean a of 500th of a cent to</v>

965
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 2>watch a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends how long the video is,</v>

966
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.480
<v Speaker 2>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

967
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be a scale.</v>

968
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 2>You could pay a penny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

969
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.230
<v Speaker 2>You could pay a penny or half a penny or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 10th of a penny to watch a video.</v>

970
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would that work for the people that</v>

971
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:46.380
<v Speaker 2>are providing content like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you see the thing is they operate</v>

972
00:50:46.381 --> 00:50:51.381
<v Speaker 2>at a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have 30,000 views on one of my videos,</v>

973
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:55.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So youtube pays me 30 bucks for that.</v>

974
00:50:55.611 --> 00:51:00.611
<v Speaker 2>If I put ads in front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was getting a penny from each of my</v>

975
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 2>customers or because these are like hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>long videos,</v>

976
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm going to charge more baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to charge twenty five cents.</v>

977
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Know 30,000 views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five cents.</v>

978
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Somebody do the math please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

979
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.060
<v Speaker 2>not good at math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven grand?</v>

980
00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like 70 bucks.</v>

981
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>$70.</v>

982
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five cents as a quarter of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar.</v>

983
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 7,000.</v>

984
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:26.474
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

985
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.343
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's a rare time where I'm writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the math fucking quick question like</v>

987
00:51:31.001 --> 00:51:34.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I'm going to charge less maybe,</v>

988
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:39.550
<v Speaker 2>but in any case I can beat what youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives me in terms of ad revenue with</v>

989
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 2>each customer paying a fraction</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a penny.</v>

990
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:49.970
<v Speaker 2>And here's the real question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get this content for free right</v>

991
00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interest.</v>

992
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Why would I pay a fraction of a penny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get it for free.</v>

993
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.250
<v Speaker 2>You're paying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying in.</v>

994
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In micro violations of your privacy.</v>

995
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 2>What's your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the product costs less than two or</v>

996
00:52:03.741 --> 00:52:07.200
<v Speaker 2>$3,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the stank face now if agreeing</v>

997
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was a weird way to word it.</v>

998
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it'll get another cord,</v>

999
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the payment is worth less than two or</v>

1000
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:15.610
<v Speaker 2>$3,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1001
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Which means they can't collect it with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit card.</v>

1002
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is they're selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>your data to advertisers.</v>

1003
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 2>There are selling your identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your demographics,</v>

1004
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.960
<v Speaker 2>your data to advertise a series here</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting.</v>

1005
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:31.280
<v Speaker 2>You're having to give up things you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give them up at that moment.</v>

1006
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 2>You've given them a previously when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>registered for the thing and verified</v>

1007
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:41.141
<v Speaker 2>your email and then verified your age</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your gender and provided all of this</v>

1008
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>demographic information which they then</v>
<v Speaker 2>parcel often and gives to the</v>

1009
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 2>advertisers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're still paying for the content.</v>

1010
00:52:49.101 --> 00:52:54.101
<v Speaker 2>What you're paying by the fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can no longer engage with the web</v>

1011
00:52:55.311 --> 00:53:00.311
<v Speaker 2>without it being filtered to what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you want and who they think you</v>

1012
00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:01.304
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1013
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting this highly filtered</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigeonholed view of content,</v>

1014
00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 2>and they do that using your information</v>
<v Speaker 2>to present what they think you would</v>

1015
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 2>like to watch based on what they've sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the advertisers.</v>

1016
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:16.130
<v Speaker 2>You're no longer a customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the product,</v>

1017
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 2>the customer is the advertising agency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you sell content directly,</v>

1018
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>you reestablish the relationship of who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the creator</v>

1019
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 3>and who is the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consumer of this content,</v>

1020
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 3>and you cut out the middleman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 3>but you're cutting out advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

1022
00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>And also the other thing is like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to pay even if it's a</v>

1023
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:41.070
<v Speaker 3>fraction of a penny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't want to pay.</v>

1024
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think if people.</v>

1025
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.820
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of dopes at watch youtube</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day,</v>

1026
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 3>like they sit in front of the coMputer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they slack jaw from morning to night and</v>

1027
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:51.870
<v Speaker 3>they just watch youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they just calculated those fractions</v>

1028
00:53:51.871 --> 00:53:54.730
<v Speaker 3>of a penny all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be dollars and dollars every</v>

1029
00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would mean hundreds of dollars</v>

1030
00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 3>every few months or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1031
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:03.840
<v Speaker 3>you got to think about this as a broader</v>
<v Speaker 3>economy because a lot of these people</v>

1032
00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:07.320
<v Speaker 3>could also earn a bath by making a a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good comment,</v>

1033
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.090
<v Speaker 3>which actually ends up covering some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our costs of viewing.</v>

1034
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:13.240
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to think about.</v>

1035
00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 3>You can earn from comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:17.330
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blockchain,</v>

1037
00:54:17.331 --> 00:54:18.870
<v Speaker 3>all this that you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1038
00:54:18.871 --> 00:54:21.180
<v Speaker 3>you could do this with bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do this with blockchain.</v>

1039
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>blockchain and bitcoin?</v>

1040
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to hijack that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1041
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.970
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1042
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.610
<v Speaker 3>so blockchain is one of the technologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>used in bitcoin.</v>

1043
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 3>IT's a distributed database where all oF</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transactions are linked together</v>

1044
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:36.790
<v Speaker 3>using cryptographic proofs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1045
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin is one implementation of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>blockchain.</v>

1046
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 3>And blockchain has now been used as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>maRketing term.</v>

1047
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.570
<v Speaker 3>That means very little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like web to datto.</v>

1048
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1049
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of datto yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Which is blockchain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1051
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.393
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1052
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 3>That's ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>

1053
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:56.760
<v Speaker 3>It?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is.</v>

1054
00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's nebulous.</v>

1055
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is that you can do more</v>

1056
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:04.170
<v Speaker 3>than just currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1057
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 3>earlier we were talking a bit about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trolling on twitter and other platforms</v>

1058
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 3>like that before we started the live</v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast.</v>

1059
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about what a troll is doing.</v>

1060
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is they're stealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

1061
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.540
<v Speaker 3>They're taking attention without</v>
<v Speaker 3>contributing anything back to the</v>

1062
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1063
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:24.850
<v Speaker 3>there's an interesting and fairly</v>
<v Speaker 3>effective market solution to this,</v>

1064
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:29.460
<v Speaker 3>which is instead of assigning someone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do oversight and decide who is and who</v>

1065
00:55:29.461 --> 00:55:34.140
<v Speaker 3>isn't a troll and censor them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically allow people to contribute</v>

1066
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.280
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a minuscule fraction for the comments</v>

1067
00:55:38.281 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 3>they like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are power like thumbs up.</v>

1068
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 3>But with each one of those likes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thumbs up,</v>

1069
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:47.620
<v Speaker 3>you attach a 10000th of a penny with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1070
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>

1071
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 3>tiny money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1072
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:56.280
<v Speaker 3>and then the people who write comments</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are broadly appreciated,</v>

1073
00:55:56.281 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 3>that add value to the community or in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny bit of money,</v>

1074
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.980
<v Speaker 3>not really anything serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they tried to come and they have</v>

1075
00:56:01.981 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 3>to spend a bit of that credit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've earned that reputation that</v>

1076
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:06.024
<v Speaker 3>they've earned.</v>

1077
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:09.210
<v Speaker 3>And if they're not a troll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

1078
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.930
<v Speaker 3>It all comes out equal in the wash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't end up spending anything.</v>

1079
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 3>They don't end up hurting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just participation in the</v>

1080
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they're a troll is suddenly</v>

1081
00:56:16.951 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>starts getting interesting because now</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets expensive to steal the attention</v>

1082
00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:23.950
<v Speaker 3>to the community because the less you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have</v>

1083
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.450
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more expensive it gets for you to</v>

1084
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.430
<v Speaker 2>post until eventually you're priced out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BuT does that also,</v>

1085
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 1>they're also can kind of enforce or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage confirmation bias because if</v>

1086
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you go to a website that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely ridiculous and it's a message</v>

1087
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 1>board filled with morons and you argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

1088
00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:48.020
<v Speaker 1>it could cost you to argue with morons</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] they're going to downhill</v>

1089
00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1090
00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1091
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:53.180
<v Speaker 2>It could just choose to not comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

1092
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.440
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think about this again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across a broader economy with a broader</v>

1093
00:56:57.441 --> 00:57:01.190
<v Speaker 2>set of forums in which in some you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>valued experts in other.</v>

1094
00:57:01.191 --> 00:57:05.180
<v Speaker 2>You're the idiot who's arguing against</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conventional wisdom and,</v>

1095
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:08.300
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually balance these things</v>

1096
00:57:08.301 --> 00:57:08.670
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1097
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Well if you go to a flat earth forum and</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue with those people and it costs you</v>

1098
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:13.360
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1099
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an argument with someone about</v>

1100
00:57:15.011 --> 00:57:17.230
<v Speaker 2>chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did thAt go?</v>

1101
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 2>It went really went very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interestingly.</v>

1102
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't expecting them to change their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

1103
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they really wanted to hear my</v>

1104
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 2>opinion and it was really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we started the conversation.</v>

1105
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1106
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:36.490
<v Speaker 2>first I'm a pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a pilot's license,</v>

1107
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I fly small planes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that puts you at an extreme advantage.</v>

1108
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This conversation will you think you</v>

1109
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:46.610
<v Speaker 2>would think that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1110
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1111
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not appeal to authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1112
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 2>It's saying those nozzles that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing at,</v>

1113
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I know what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>

1114
00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I have to walk around the plane before I</v>
<v Speaker 2>take off and make sure all of them have</v>

1115
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 2>correctly attached into the place they</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be doing the things they should</v>

1116
00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 2>be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I don't survive the flight.</v>

1117
00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So you are a part of the chem trail</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprayers,</v>

1118
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:11.910
<v Speaker 1>association of America,</v>

1119
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.380
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1120
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.210
<v Speaker 2>So that was pretty much the conclusIon</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reached.</v>

1121
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:18.820
<v Speaker 2>What are those nozzles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually in the,</v>

1122
00:58:18.821 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ones pointing forward are called</v>

1123
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 2>peto tubes and they're used to measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>the velocity of the aircraft through the</v>

1124
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:30.790
<v Speaker 2>air by a pressure differential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ones pointing backwards are</v>

1125
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:35.480
<v Speaker 2>usually to break up of fortresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little swirly current severity</v>

1126
00:58:35.481 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 2>that come off the wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cause turbulence,</v>

1127
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.330
<v Speaker 2>and you want to break those up so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't swirl.</v>

1128
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the weight of the trails are clouds.</v>

1129
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.890
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been a shell with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>water?</v>

1130
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:48.370
<v Speaker 2>The government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

1131
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.380
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm michelle.</v>

1132
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm michelle for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't believe one of the things I'm</v>

1133
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut it off jamie.</v>

1134
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had these conversations with people</v>

1135
00:58:55.550 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 2>and frustrating you can present</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains of evidence if someone really,</v>

1136
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 2>really doesn't want to believe they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really will not belief.</v>

1137
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:05.693
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>

1138
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been going on forever.</v>

1139
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go back to the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pictures black and White photos</v>

1140
00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:18.100
<v Speaker 1>from world war one or world war two</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather where you can see planes leaving</v>

1141
00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 1>behind these enormous trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a stupid argument.</v>

1142
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

1143
00:59:22.791 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've known for a long time that</v>

1144
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>depending upon how much moisture is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere,</v>

1145
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 1>when planes pass through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will create clouds.</v>

1146
00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:34.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's just real simple changes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the air.</v>

1147
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 1>And it creates clouds and it's usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>on hazy days.</v>

1148
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nasa has a website where you can go</v>

1149
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:43.400
<v Speaker 1>to it and it will accurately predict</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary.</v>

1150
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ooo,</v>

1151
00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 1>that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are from propeller engines in the</v>

1152
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 1>19 forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening is the propeller is</v>

1153
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:53.930
<v Speaker 1>compressing the air and when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>compresses the air of the change in</v>

1154
00:59:53.931 --> 00:59:58.931
<v Speaker 1>pressure changes the dewpoint and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dewpoint is what determines whether the</v>

1155
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:04.180
<v Speaker 1>error moisture consensus into a visible</v>
<v Speaker 1>vapor into droplets that are clouds.</v>

1156
01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>And so by pushing a thing through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

1157
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you're pressing on the air and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>press on the air is that causes</v>

1158
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:17.390
<v Speaker 1>condensation to form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that conversation follows you in a</v>

1159
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cloud behind the plane.</v>

1160
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>And this happens at any plane propeller</v>
<v Speaker 1>plane that I,</v>

1161
01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I've done it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a four seater cessna that's smaller</v>

1162
01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>than a than a fiat sedan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1163
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

1164
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>on a wet day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see little trails coming off the</v>

1165
01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>tips of the wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I pretty short and put any spray</v>

1166
01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>nozzles there or flip this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1167
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it said chem trail them and I</v>

1168
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't flip it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1169
01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>you don't how much liquid you would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have in your plane in order to spray</v>

1170
01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>these enormous jets across the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1171
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>it would be insane.</v>

1172
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>It would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if the entire plane was filled</v>

1173
01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean filled and you would have so much</v>

1174
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>liquid that it will be visible from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground floating in space.</v>

1175
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And then he talked to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I did that television show on scifi</v>
<v Speaker 1>called joe rogan questions,</v>

1177
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I questioned</v>

1178
01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>was chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to a bunch of temp trill,</v>

1179
01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>air quote experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of these guys had this study</v>

1180
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:25.871
<v Speaker 1>that he had done on water and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing water study was proving that</v>

1181
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the spraying and the air was making</v>
<v Speaker 1>aluminum.</v>

1182
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was putting aluminum in the water and</v>

1183
01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>the water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he had this water tested.</v>

1184
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed me the test.</v>

1185
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1186
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says sludge.</v>

1187
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1188
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it was water.</v>

1189
01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I gave them water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1190
01:01:45.351 --> 01:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it set sludge like the laboratory</v>

1191
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>that you sent this stuff to says sludge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he and he was like,</v>

1192
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is exactly sludge?</v>

1193
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>What's the definition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1194
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's google it.</v>

1195
01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So we googled sludge and with sledges is</v>
<v Speaker 1>water mixed with dirt.</v>

1196
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.091
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1197
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>so your water mixed with dirt contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>aluminum.</v>

1198
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much aluminum there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dirt?</v>

1199
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Because it's the exact amount that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested when they tested the world.</v>

1200
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>The water that you had with dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened is your dirt tested</v>

1201
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:25.881
<v Speaker 1>positive for being dirt and you're using</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as proof that the government is</v>

1202
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:32.091
<v Speaker 1>spraying the skies above everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>head and you want to talk about like a</v>

1203
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>piss poor cost ineffective shitbag</v>
<v Speaker 1>program that does absolutely nothing.</v>

1204
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Chem trails would be it because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything like no one's getting</v>

1205
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>

1206
01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no lake rise in illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like mind control going on.</v>

1207
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no mind control going on.</v>

1208
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>There is no mind control going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There Is no mind controlling.</v>

1209
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the dumbest fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be easier to just put it in your</v>

1210
01:02:58.111 --> 01:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>municipal water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1211
01:02:59.561 --> 01:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean as arguments that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

1212
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:02.281
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1213
01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they move it with the planes</v>

1214
01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 1>to the spraying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drops.</v>

1215
01:03:09.031 --> 01:03:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It falls in the water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you drank something like that.</v>

1216
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.713
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1217
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1218
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>But they're immune to it because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are lizards,</v>

1219
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>you know they're down here too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you spray the sky indiscriminately.</v>

1220
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you some illuminati or</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting sprayed.</v>

1221
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get some hate mail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1222
01:03:23.881 --> 01:03:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I know it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1223
01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting it right now.</v>

1224
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>People are wiping the cheetos off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're greasy little fat fucking</v>

1225
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 1>fingers right now in hammering at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>keyboards.</v>

1226
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Ready to call a shills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the dumbest.</v>

01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in there can't take their</v>

1266
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:09.900
<v Speaker 1>money out for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity.</v>

1267
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:13.620
<v Speaker 1>That's insane that that's kind of like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1268
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you don't know this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at that.</v>

1269
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1270
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

1271
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.833
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1272
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>if you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to guess,</v>

1273
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you two options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1274
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>legit or scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1275
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1276
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I would say it is most likely a ponzi</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme,</v>

1277
01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>which is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something people throw around a lot.</v>

1278
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>But here's the interesting thing is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>do these schemes happen?</v>

1279
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you look at his offer?</v>

1280
01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:48.270
<v Speaker 1>He offers an extraordinary guarantee</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our june.</v>

1281
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>You never lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1282
01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.573
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of names?</v>

1283
01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of investment fraud is</v>

1284
01:05:54.711 --> 01:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>guaranteed returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you make a guarantee like that,</v>

1285
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it's usually one of the triggers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets people investigated.</v>

1286
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:05.480
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never lose money.</v>

1287
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great investment.</v>

1288
01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investment should get involved.</v>

1289
01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe put some bitcoin in that and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solidify it.</v>

1290
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1291
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you invest your money in bitcoin,</v>

1292
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.660
<v Speaker 2>you will lose money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1293
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will gain money.</v>

1294
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.800
<v Speaker 2>You will lose money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will gain money,</v>

1295
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you will lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

1296
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 2>That's no one is an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I want to be really careful about</v>

1297
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:34.111
<v Speaker 2>this because many people go out and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>push these things as investments and you</v>

1298
01:06:37.241 --> 01:06:39.790
<v Speaker 2>can have a lot of volatility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when you have a lot of</v>

1299
01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people get lucky and they make a</v>

1300
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:45.970
<v Speaker 2>lot of money and some people are great</v>
<v Speaker 2>at picking their moment and they make</v>

1301
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>some money</v>

1302
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>bail out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make a ton of money.</v>

1303
01:06:48.021 --> 01:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Like right now we're at 600 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bought it back when it was like,</v>

1304
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lowest point,</v>

1305
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lowest,</v>

1306
01:06:54.981 --> 01:06:56.330
<v Speaker 2>lowest point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest lowest,</v>

1307
01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a thousandth of a dollar,</v>

1308
01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of a dollar to two to $600.</v>

1309
01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1310
01:07:03.531 --> 01:07:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

1311
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean if you put in like a fucking</v>

1312
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.830
<v Speaker 2>big pile of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1313
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.500
<v Speaker 2>five grand and he took it out the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

1314
01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:16.440
<v Speaker 2>you would lose all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why this isn't,</v>

1315
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.290
<v Speaker 2>this isn't a speculative instruments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can speculate in it,</v>

1316
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:22.220
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1317
01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

1318
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but isn't the well kind of poisoned the</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial well with speculative</v>

1319
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>investing like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are doing,</v>

1320
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it shouldn't be legal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really fucked up about it is that</v>

1321
01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it with algorithms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1322
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.030
<v Speaker 1>they're gambling and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1323
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>they're buying and selling within like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of a second and they're doing</v>

1324
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 1>it in the point where there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiolab podcast where they talked about</v>

1325
01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>how investment firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that one or listen to that</v>

1326
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have heard that one yet.</v>

1327
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:58.260
<v Speaker 1>We're investment firms moved their</v>
<v Speaker 1>servers closer to the exchange so that</v>

1328
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you get in there their orders and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchanges quicker.</v>

1329
01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>There</v>

1330
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:07.530
<v Speaker 2>is small on New Jersey where the data</v>
<v Speaker 2>centers of the.</v>

1331
01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.800
<v Speaker 2>None of the stock trading happens in</v>
<v Speaker 2>manhattan.</v>

1332
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:14.070
<v Speaker 2>It happens across the water in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey as a data center.</v>

1333
01:08:14.071 --> 01:08:19.071
<v Speaker 2>There were probably largest amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money moves ever and they have measured</v>

1334
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 2>runs of fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that in order to be fair,</v>

1335
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.420
<v Speaker 2>the fiber optic cable between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>service that do the trading and every</v>

1336
01:08:26.421 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 2>one of the racks that are in the room</v>
<v Speaker 2>are measured to be the equal length so</v>

1337
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:35.801
<v Speaker 2>that the speed of light to limitation</v>
<v Speaker 2>across a room of a hundred feet does not</v>

1338
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 2>advantage one customer over another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that incredible?</v>

1339
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.900
<v Speaker 2>We're talking microseconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1340
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1341
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:43.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1342
01:08:43.531 --> 01:08:48.531
<v Speaker 1>people have been forced because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move their offices from the middle of</v>

1343
01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:54.171
<v Speaker 1>the country where they were to right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there or rent space where their servers</v>

1344
01:08:54.511 --> 01:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>are right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

1345
01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre because a lot of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is actually done with computers,</v>

1346
01:09:00.211 --> 01:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>so these computers are operating on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm.</v>

1347
01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>The algorithms recognize patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start these exchanges and they buy</v>

1348
01:09:06.451 --> 01:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>and sell and buy and sell and buy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell and do all of this within fractions</v>

1349
01:09:10.411 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>of a second.</v>

1350
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over the last decade,</v>

1351
01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 2>most trading floors have seen 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their traders disappear.</v>

1352
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:18.530
<v Speaker 2>So they're empty rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see photos all that to align</v>

1353
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.680
<v Speaker 2>where it shows before and after photos</v>
<v Speaker 2>of very big banks like ubs and jp</v>

1354
01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 2>morgan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goldman sachs,</v>

1355
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 2>companies like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see their trading Floor and it is</v>

1356
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 2>empty because a lot of that has now</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to algorithmic trading.</v>

1357
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:35.720
<v Speaker 2>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a weird,</v>

1358
01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:38.290
<v Speaker 2>weird way to invest in bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1359
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the before and after and it's not</v>

1360
01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 2>because they're making less money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1361
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a downturn.</v>

1362
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:47.780
<v Speaker 2>This during this time they've actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>made more money,</v>

1363
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about those stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange videos that were in movies,</v>

1364
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:54.880
<v Speaker 1>you know by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sal,</v>

1365
01:09:54.881 --> 01:09:57.920
<v Speaker 1>sal and they've got their hands up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there I want to have these and five of</v>

1366
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:01.250
<v Speaker 1>these and they're holding up pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper that is so daunting.</v>

1367
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:06.020
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff is so confusing to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person on the outside looking at that</v>

1368
01:10:06.021 --> 01:10:08.150
<v Speaker 1>and trying to figure out what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are doing.</v>

1369
01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems exciting and chaotic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrant but so confusing.</v>

1370
01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is.</v>

1371
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:21.420
<v Speaker 2>That is the american economy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially it's based on confidence all</v>

1372
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:23.430
<v Speaker 2>that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1373
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we talk about a slightly</v>

1374
01:10:27.091 --> 01:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>different topic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1375
01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you about some of the new</v>

1376
01:10:31.441 --> 01:10:33.120
<v Speaker 2>developments that are happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin,</v>

1377
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:37.740
<v Speaker 2>which I find interesting and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to show because this is not really</v>

1378
01:10:37.741 --> 01:10:41.820
<v Speaker 2>about a company or a specific product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to talk about one of the</v>

1379
01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>things that has me excited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

1380
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you combine a</v>

1381
01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:54.020
<v Speaker 2>technology that looks very much like</v>
<v Speaker 2>peer to peer napster or bit torrens with</v>

1382
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.840
<v Speaker 2>a merchant service like [inaudible] bay</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you create this hybrid technology</v>

1383
01:11:00.211 --> 01:11:03.260
<v Speaker 2>which is a completely peer to peer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1384
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.500
<v Speaker 2>store service called open bazaar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1385
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:12.570
<v Speaker 2>and this is basically a system where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>run on your computer some software and</v>

1386
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>you can open a store to delivery the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical goods or virtual goods,</v>

1387
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 2>have them listed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have them found by others,</v>

1388
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>and then all of the payments are done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>

1389
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So by decentralizing the payment system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can also decentralize the store</v>

1390
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:38.781
<v Speaker 2>system completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is a completely borderless</v>

1391
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>multinational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1392
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.640
<v Speaker 2>open and peer to peer open source</v>
<v Speaker 2>software merchant system running on top</v>

1393
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 2>of bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just find fascinating.</v>

1394
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.830
<v Speaker 2>The ability for anyone to open a store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in countries where you don't</v>

1395
01:11:55.831 --> 01:11:56.940
<v Speaker 2>have ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1396
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:02.490
<v Speaker 2>And be able to sell goods and services</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world and receive</v>

1397
01:12:02.491 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 2>payments in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And does this operational right now?</v>

1398
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm selling that book,</v>

1399
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on open bazaar.</v>

1400
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:14.260
<v Speaker 2>So how does one access openbazaar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1401
01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.030
<v Speaker 2>to the luddite?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run software,</v>

1402
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:20.100
<v Speaker 2>no fees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no restriction.</v>

1403
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:24.580
<v Speaker 2>And they downloads the software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run it on their computer funds a bit</v>

1404
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin wallet and which sits on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

1405
01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:28.590
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to give their money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty one.</v>

1406
01:12:28.591 --> 01:12:32.520
<v Speaker 2>There was no intermediaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you buy directly from the store and</v>

1407
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:35.610
<v Speaker 2>the person running the store is running</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same software.</v>

1408
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what some of the things that</v>

1409
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 2>they have available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to openbazaar.org.</v>

1410
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I have to download the program so to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find another way to look at it.</v>

1411
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1412
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to,</v>

1413
01:12:43.861 --> 01:12:45.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1414
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>search is a search engine on top d u o s</v>

1415
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:54.450
<v Speaker 2>e a r c h.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So duo search.</v>

1416
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because this is an open protocol and</v>

1417
01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 2>because all of the listings are in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>peer to peer network,</v>

1418
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.650
<v Speaker 2>you can just go online and run a search</v>
<v Speaker 2>engine and create a search engine that</v>

1419
01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:06.740
<v Speaker 2>searches the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1420
01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:10.650
<v Speaker 2>This is the third party that just has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>search engine for searching the store.</v>

1421
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:15.651
<v Speaker 2>So you can um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can search online there and tell him</v>

1422
01:13:16.081 --> 01:13:20.620
<v Speaker 2>what you're looking for and find</v>
<v Speaker 2>something from tee shirts to gary and</v>

1423
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 2>find my bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1424
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:24.180
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I want to buy a flip</v>

1425
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:25.043

1426
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Go back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get a phone for ari.</v>

1427
01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these darks are going to flip</v>

1428
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:34.710
<v Speaker 2>phones now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 bucks for a cryo.</v>

1429
01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:39.711
<v Speaker 2>Sarah or that's an lg lg 44 damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>bargain.</v>

1430
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about going flip</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>

1431
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:44.663
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1432
01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1433
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the opposite category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't actually received a phone call</v>

1434
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 2>on my phone probably in three years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a phone I had out of here.</v>

1435
01:13:55.650 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I have a portable computer which also</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a phone function on it that I keep</v>

1436
01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>switched off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep it off pretty much.</v>

1437
01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bring ever.</v>

1438
01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't every text you um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people text you.</v>

1439
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1440
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:11.070
<v Speaker 2>but that actually gets redirected to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>email.</v>

1441
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:12.290
<v Speaker 2>So I don't do texts.</v>

1442
01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1443
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I do it through either hangouts or</v>
<v Speaker 3>email.</v>

1444
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.110
<v Speaker 3>So when I send you a text,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really appeal to you as a</v>

1445
01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 3>text?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1446
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.450
<v Speaker 3>it comes through to a google hangouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are one of the weirdest guy.</v>

1447
01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use it as a portable computer.</v>

1448
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:27.970
<v Speaker 3>It's my communicator device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The phone function is irrelevant to me.</v>

1449
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:29.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't You ever want to talk to people?</v>

1450
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.730

<v Speaker 3>OkaY.</v>

1454
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I talk to people,</v>

1455
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:40.910

<v Speaker 3>cbd oil,</v>

1456
01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:41.770
<v Speaker 3>organic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pure,</v>

<v Speaker 3>jurisdiction where it's legal,</v>

1464
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they can sell it within that</v>

1465
01:15:03.401 --> 01:15:07.290
<v Speaker 3>jurisdiction from that jurisdiction and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly legal in Colorado.</v>

1466
01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.540
<v Speaker 3>It's growing and getting insides.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that like everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else the company does or will,</v>

1476
01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:36.130
<v Speaker 3>you just don't like the restrictive</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of it.</v>

1477
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:37.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Which I have a nexus five.</v>

1481
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:45.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

1482
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:49.090

<v Speaker 3>greatest of the google phones.</v>

1483
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:53.710

<v Speaker 3>It's I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own the phone,</v>

1485
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:57.400

<v Speaker 3>It's not a lease.</v>

1486
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1489
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.510

1490
01:16:10.511 --> 01:16:15.340
<v Speaker 3>the slight differences in hardware</v>
<v Speaker 3>really are irrelevant at this point.</v>

1491
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.680
<v Speaker 3>While it does matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

1492
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:21.970
<v Speaker 3>is watch You can and can't do with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>software and how much of your life at</v>

1493
01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:26.200
<v Speaker 3>controls and how much privacy you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the software that you run on these</v>

1494
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.420
<v Speaker 3>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As You may have noticed,</v>

1495
01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm all about control and privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being able to control my money,</v>

1496
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:35.920
<v Speaker 3>control my devices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control my privacy.</v>

1497
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that should be a principle that we</v>

1498
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:41.370
<v Speaker 3>should all celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1499
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a fundamental freedom and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>gradually losing it.</v>

1500
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of options as well,</v>

1501
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.140
<v Speaker 3>so I'm happy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1502
01:16:50.141 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 3>androids come along and created options,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1503
01:16:52.811 --> 01:16:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Because it was for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1504
01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:55.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an option,</v>

1505
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:57.010
<v Speaker 3>but it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1506
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.550
<v Speaker 3>And now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just me.</v>

1507
01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.080
<v Speaker 3>The galaxy s seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever messed with that?</v>

1508
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:04.820
<v Speaker 3>The samsung galaxy s seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it.</v>

1509
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a phenomenal phone.</v>

1510
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 3>It is easily as good as an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing phone.</v>

1511
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Throw it into a gear vr headsets and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fully immersive vr that is</v>

1512
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.940
<v Speaker 2>mindblowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a little headset that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can put this phone into,</v>

1514
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.910
<v Speaker 2>into vr.</v>

1515
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as good as the htc vive.</v>

1516
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 1>MY friend duncan duncan trussell as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vive.</v>

1517
01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.340
<v Speaker 2>AlrIght.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also paid $30 for my headset</v>

1518
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.750
<v Speaker 2>is what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,200?</v>

1519
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It's probably something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slight difference in price.</v>

1520
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely differences in price,</v>

1521
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.670
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very encouraging that not only is</v>

1522
01:17:43.671 --> 01:17:46.760
<v Speaker 1>there a competitor to apple but it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an equal now,</v>

1523
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just think the more options people</v>

1524
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 1>have like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better there are for everybody and</v>

1525
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice if there was a commensurate</v>

1526
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:56.900
<v Speaker 1>operating system because there's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1527
01:17:57.610 --> 01:17:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

1528
01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1529
01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.350
<v Speaker 2>for geek heads like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's linux,</v>

1530
01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:05.650
<v Speaker 2>but essentially what happened is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>linux was so successful,</v>

1531
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.880
<v Speaker 2>it became android.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Android was built on top of linux.</v>

1532
01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Essentially it is at its very core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is linux,</v>

1533
01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why don't they make,</v>

1534
01:18:14.021 --> 01:18:16.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of an operating system for a</v>

1535
01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:17.800
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a laptop,</v>

1536
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:19.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because from what I can tell,</v>

1537
01:18:19.901 --> 01:18:23.200
<v Speaker 2>really laptops are gradually</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappearing.</v>

1538
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.660
<v Speaker 2>The laptop market is disappearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1539
01:18:25.661 --> 01:18:28.840
<v Speaker 2>really fast today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some announcements from</v>

1540
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:32.290
<v Speaker 2>apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're changing some of their operating</v>

1541
01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:35.210
<v Speaker 2>system commitments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're making the seven.</v>

1542
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making the operating system more</v>

1543
01:18:37.361 --> 01:18:42.361
<v Speaker 2>and more like ios and gradually</v>
<v Speaker 2>diminishing the importance of,</v>

1544
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.950
<v Speaker 2>of laptops because most people do pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much everything they need to do on their</v>

1545
01:18:47.951 --> 01:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>smartphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays.</v>

1546
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1547
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it makes a difference that it's nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can take my phone with me.</v>

1548
01:18:55.621 --> 01:18:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I have the larger iphone that I use most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time and I also have a samsung</v>

1549
01:18:59.371 --> 01:19:01.950
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the larger iphone that I use most of</v>

1550
01:19:01.951 --> 01:19:05.880
<v Speaker 1>the time I can take with me and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like I'm missing a laptop,</v>

1551
01:19:05.881 --> 01:19:08.640
<v Speaker 1>but if I need to work on and get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff done,</v>

1552
01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I want a laptop keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

1553
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>If I'm writing especially I want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to work.</v>

1554
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to also plug in</v>
<v Speaker 1>headsets and listen to music while I'm</v>

1556
01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.180
<v Speaker 1>working and also have power at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1557
01:19:21.181 --> 01:19:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of actual computers.</v>

1558
01:19:25.111 --> 01:19:30.111
<v Speaker 1>I like an actual computer at home with</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attached keyboard and a real monitor.</v>

1559
01:19:30.121 --> 01:19:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think those things.</v>

1560
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:35.880
<v Speaker 1>There's some benefits of those things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who writes in particular.</v>

1561
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1562
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the great american novel is</v>
<v Speaker 2>being written by thumbs right now?</v>

1563
01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Wright was writing a whole book</v>

1564
01:19:43.141 --> 01:19:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1565
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was writing a novel in tweets on a</v>

1566
01:19:48.421 --> 01:19:53.100
<v Speaker 1>real keyboard book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money were for people who are listening.</v>

1567
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:58.290
<v Speaker 1>So what else is exciting for you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now about</v>

1568
01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:01.360
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think one of the things we've seen</v>

1569
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:04.270
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has been quite interesting is that</v>

1570
01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:09.271
<v Speaker 2>it has become easier and easier and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use and easier to get into bitcoin and</v>

1571
01:20:10.471 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>easier to use bitcoin in your everyday</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1572
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:16.860
<v Speaker 2>I remember a time when it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to do all of those</v>

1573
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:21.060
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are probably six or 700</v>

1574
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.150
<v Speaker 2>exchanges around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1575
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.920
<v Speaker 2>you talked about mt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gox in Japan,</v>

1576
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:30.210
<v Speaker 2>the first bitcoin exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really the first major bitcoin</v>

1577
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>exchange at the time it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange,</v>

1578
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:38.120
<v Speaker 2>there were no others and that was both a</v>
<v Speaker 2>single point of failure and a weakness</v>

1579
01:20:39.511 --> 01:20:42.100
<v Speaker 2>for bitcoin as it proved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1580
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:47.150
<v Speaker 2>buT it also made it very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are at least four or five</v>

1581
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.870
<v Speaker 2>major exchanges operating in the us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very easy to access,</v>

1582
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:55.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>access the system to connect it to maybe</v>

1583
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:57.390
<v Speaker 2>to a bank account or a debit card.</v>

1584
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 2>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to convert dollars to</v>

1585
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:03.530
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin or bitcoin to dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1586
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I earn bitcoin and then I converted into</v>

1587
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 2>dollars to pay for things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1588
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I campaign bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very easy to do that.</v>

1589
01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a major advancement that makes it</v>

1590
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>much easier for people to get involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as they want.</v>

1591
01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.190
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to earn everything they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to do.</v>

1592
01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:25.660
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called between age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1593
01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:30.770
<v Speaker 2>which allows you to take a percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your paycheck and have it sent to you in</v>

1594
01:21:31.891 --> 01:21:33.010
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1595
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:36.300
<v Speaker 2>and it's very easy for an employer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>set it up with any of their traditional</v>

1596
01:21:36.301 --> 01:21:38.460
<v Speaker 2>payroll systems where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

1597
01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:40.860
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put two percent of my</v>

1598
01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:45.861
<v Speaker 2>account into a savings account and a 98</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent into my checking account.</v>

1599
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 2>A lot of companies offer that.</v>

1600
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Well now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also want to put two percent of my</v>

1601
01:21:50.821 --> 01:21:54.960
<v Speaker 2>paycheck every month into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to the employer,</v>

1602
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a routing number and</v>
<v Speaker 2>account number,</v>

1603
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 2>but on the other end it gets converted</v>
<v Speaker 2>into bitcoin and send to your bitcoin</v>

1604
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 2>wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can very easily incorporate this</v>

1605
01:22:04.891 --> 01:22:08.850
<v Speaker 2>as part of your everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's another thing,</v>

1606
01:22:08.851 --> 01:22:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try and show this in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't cause me a big problem with</v>

1607
01:22:12.031 --> 01:22:13.290
<v Speaker 2>my finances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1608
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.590
<v Speaker 2>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it caused you a big problem if someone</v>

1609
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:18.180
<v Speaker 2>sees something to show the credit card</v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

1610
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1611
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.080
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a super crypto</v>

1612
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.950
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bitcoin debit card and basically</v>

1613
01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:32.310
<v Speaker 2>it operates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the exchanges in the us</v>

1614
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:37.311
<v Speaker 2>offers this and there's actually tore</v>
<v Speaker 2>three in the us that now offer this kind</v>

1615
01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:38.603
<v Speaker 2>of service.</v>

1616
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's behind this is a bitcoin wallet.</v>

1617
01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have dollars in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have bitcoin in this,</v>

1618
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.890
<v Speaker 2>but when I went to the coffee shop or I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got this coffee earlier today,</v>

1619
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I swipe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1620
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.410
<v Speaker 2>did they look at you sideways?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1621
01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can't tell they they see a</v>
<v Speaker 2>visa card.</v>

1622
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It says visa on the front says debit</v>
<v Speaker 2>visa.</v>

1623
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say bitcoin anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1624
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 2>and so I make a payment and I get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little message on my phone that says</v>

1625
01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 2>we've debited zero point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

1626
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two bitcoin from your account for your</v>

1627
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>purchase at the coffee shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can even tip them in bitcoin.</v>

1628
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's where it gets interesting.</v>

1629
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tRavel all around the world,</v>

1630
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 2>do these talks and these conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm constantly on the road and I've</v>

1631
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:25.690
<v Speaker 2>tried again and again with my bank</v>
<v Speaker 2>account to tell them,</v>

1632
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I travel.</v>

1633
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>When are you traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>

1634
01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you traveling next?</v>

1635
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 different countries in the next seven</v>

1636
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:37.450
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just put a note somewhere in my</v>

1637
01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:41.080
<v Speaker 2>account that says do not Block his visa</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it shows up somewhere we don't expect</v>

1638
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>because this person travels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>American express can do it.</v>

1639
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.350
<v Speaker 2>My bank can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They simply can't.</v>

1640
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 2>They want me 24 hours before I leave to</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them and give them a specific list</v>

1641
01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 2>of places that I'm going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1642
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:57.460
<v Speaker 2>and when I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I tried to use my card,</v>

1643
01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:02.610
<v Speaker 2>it gets blocked until I come back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>us and talk to them on the phone and a</v>

1644
01:24:03.101 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of questions about whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really me who bought,</v>

1645
01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pastry in prague or something like</v>

1646
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.420
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that all block it.</v>

1647
01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And what's happened repeatedly in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last few months is I'll go somewhere,</v>

1648
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Speaker 2>my card will get blocked because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot to tell them and then I'll pull</v>

1649
01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 2>out the line card and it works</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere without fail because it's a</v>

1650
01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 2>prepaid because it's a debit everywhere.</v>

1651
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Without fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I need to move more money into it,</v>

1652
01:24:27.181 --> 01:24:29.980
<v Speaker 2>if I need to take money cash out of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>atm when I'm traveling,</v>

1653
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I can use this and it's so much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can simply transfer bitcoin into that</v>

1654
01:24:34.871 --> 01:24:39.871
<v Speaker 2>account and 10 minutes later I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>withdraw that in cash in any currency in</v>

1655
01:24:40.631 --> 01:24:43.150
<v Speaker 2>any country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say that it was such glee.</v>

1656
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:46.940
<v Speaker 2>It's convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So excited about you are.</v>

1657
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:49.280
<v Speaker 2>You can't hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1658
01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get excited about these things because</v>

1659
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it makes it easy for me to use bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1660
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

1661
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.840
<v Speaker 2>it's visa as the evil empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the banking system,</v>

1662
01:24:58.841 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 2>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for many people who are going to</v>

1663
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:05.320
<v Speaker 2>experience bitcoin as an additional</v>
<v Speaker 2>currency in their life when they use for</v>

1664
01:25:05.321 --> 01:25:09.820
<v Speaker 2>online purchases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the flexibility to use both and</v>

1665
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 2>making it easier and more transparent is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you get to mainstream adoption,</v>

1666
01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:14.770
<v Speaker 2>especially in the developed world.</v>

1667
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would someone get ahold of one of</v>

1668
01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:17.000
<v Speaker 2>those cards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>

1669
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.150
<v Speaker 2>how did they just open an account with</v>
<v Speaker 2>an exchange?</v>

1670
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:23.320
<v Speaker 2>They have to do all of the patriot act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank secrecy act,</v>

1671
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:26.320
<v Speaker 2>show me id,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proof of residence,</v>

1672
01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:27.071
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1673
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:32.071
<v Speaker 2>But in the end they get a visa card and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exchanges are available for getting</v>

1674
01:25:32.471 --> 01:25:34.780
<v Speaker 2>visa debit cards like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like can you name some?</v>

1675
01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.431
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1676
01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:39.850
<v Speaker 2>in the us a coinbase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coinbase.com,</v>

1677
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bitpay bitpay.com.</v>

1678
01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Both offer a visa debit cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1679
01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 2>in many countries around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1680
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:51.820
<v Speaker 2>zappo x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a p o offer a debit card and there's a,</v>

1681
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:54.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of others.</v>

1682
01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:55.900
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1683
01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:58.540
<v Speaker 2>That's actually very promising because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it practical.</v>

1684
01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one side.</v>

1685
01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Then a few other things that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in this space.</v>

1686
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Certainly we have seen a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>banking industry realized that they</v>

1687
01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:13.151
<v Speaker 2>could actually use this technology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just fear it and you know,</v>

1688
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:18.940
<v Speaker 2>we have this and I certainly bring this</v>
<v Speaker 2>view of banks as giants,</v>

1689
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:22.370
<v Speaker 2>kara couture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur evil things,</v>

1690
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:24.410
<v Speaker 2>but within them there's just normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1691
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:24.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1692
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.770
<v Speaker 2>So swept up in the institutional inertia</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this beast,</v>

1693
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.700
<v Speaker 2>but there's people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them get it,</v>

1694
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.030
<v Speaker 2>they get this is exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and disruptive.</v>

1695
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.660
<v Speaker 2>They want to use it within the banking</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and they're trying to work from</v>

1696
01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:43.661
<v Speaker 2>within to get people interested in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're seeing more and more of these</v>

1697
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:50.171
<v Speaker 2>organizations gradually try to find ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adopt this technology to streamline</v>

1698
01:26:51.111 --> 01:26:56.111
<v Speaker 2>and to improve banking itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very similar to what we saw in</v>

1699
01:26:57.591 --> 01:27:02.240
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties when the internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>started happening muCh more mainstream.</v>

1700
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:05.000
<v Speaker 2>The phone companies at first fought it</v>
<v Speaker 2>tooth and nail,</v>

1701
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fought.</v>

1702
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.650
<v Speaker 2>The service providers tried not to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them access to their lines,</v>

1703
01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:13.310
<v Speaker 2>try not to kick them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The knock of them dsl networks at the</v>

1704
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:14.990
<v Speaker 2>tIme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1705
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:17.510
<v Speaker 2>they faulted the fcc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to control it,</v>

1706
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:23.410
<v Speaker 2>and eventually they all became isbns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1707
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:27.710
<v Speaker 2>So eventually jumped on the bandwagon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and use it to improve their own</v>

1708
01:27:27.711 --> 01:27:28.610
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1709
01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:32.180
<v Speaker 2>if you make a phone call on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional old phone,</v>

1710
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.430
<v Speaker 2>your phone call is going over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>

1711
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:39.700
<v Speaker 2>almost 90 percent sure that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wouldn't let the internet beyond</v>

1712
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:42.110
<v Speaker 2>the phone network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the entire phone network is on the</v>

1713
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:42.944
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1714
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 2>if flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's called infrastructure inversion.</v>

1715
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early days of the automobile,</v>

1716
01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:53.681
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't let automobiles in towns</v>
<v Speaker 2>too because they would disrupt the</v>

1717
01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 2>horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horse traffic,</v>

1718
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had all kinds of weird laws,</v>

1719
01:27:57.531 --> 01:27:59.870
<v Speaker 2>including in the uk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they passed the law,</v>

1720
01:27:59.871 --> 01:28:02.660
<v Speaker 2>which required someone to run ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Car with a red flag.</v>

1721
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I call the red flag act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That did wonders for the british</v>

1722
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:09.230
<v Speaker 2>automobile industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was 20 years ahead at the time.</v>

1723
01:28:09.231 --> 01:28:11.190
<v Speaker 2>And then wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1724
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.450
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of reactionary behavior is</v>

1725
01:28:14.451 --> 01:28:19.451
<v Speaker 2>very common in new technologies and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure and version happens</v>

1726
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.533
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>

1727
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.580
<v Speaker 2>The thing that was considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible,</v>

1728
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:25.760
<v Speaker 2>the roads will be paved to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>automobile travel,</v>

1729
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 2>practical everywhere happens and horses</v>
<v Speaker 2>were quite happy to ride on paved roads,</v>

1730
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:32.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1731
01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:36.740
<v Speaker 2>whereas for automobiles was almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to use in a rutted,</v>

1732
01:28:36.741 --> 01:28:41.741
<v Speaker 2>muddy road when you have a four wheel</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive vehicle trying to compete against</v>

1733
01:28:43.881 --> 01:28:48.881
<v Speaker 2>a four wheel drive animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in those early days they pointed</v>

1734
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:51.380
<v Speaker 2>that that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1735
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:54.200
<v Speaker 2>this thing is never going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automobiles and never going to happen</v>

1736
01:28:54.201 --> 01:28:55.700
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>

1737
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 2>but if you have the need infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1738
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 2>and we've seen that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the automobile up with electricity,</v>

1739
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:04.800
<v Speaker 2>we've seen that with the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We seen that with all of these</v>

1740
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 2>technologies and now we're going to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it again with money because if you have</v>

1741
01:29:09.361 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 2>this technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building the banking institutions on top</v>

1742
01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:18.381
<v Speaker 2>of this is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but making bitcoin or other</v>

1743
01:29:18.571 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the internet of money play by the</v>

1744
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 2>rules of the old banking system is</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible.</v>

1745
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Now I like that expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crypto currency and crypto currencies.</v>

1746
01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:35.420
<v Speaker 2>One is the stop banks from creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own cryptocurrency and what I</v>

1747
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is so wonderful about bitcoin in</v>

1748
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 2>comparison to other cryptocurrencies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1749
01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:45.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to stop them.</v>

1750
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already doing it.</v>

1751
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:48.240
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1752
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to realize there's more than</v>

1753
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.370
<v Speaker 2>a thousand cryptocurrencies already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A thousand.</v>

1754
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than a thousand dollars.</v>

1755
01:29:54.541 --> 01:29:57.430
<v Speaker 2>What's the worst one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was the one we should avoid that,</v>

1756
01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.840
<v Speaker 2>that list is almost 900 long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

1757
01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.473
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1758
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:03.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a long tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1759
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple that are interesting</v>

1760
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:08.820
<v Speaker 2>that offer different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1761
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.790
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing a lot of private</v>

1762
01:30:11.791 --> 01:30:14.250
<v Speaker 2>institutions interested in creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own,</v>

1763
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's nothing stopping them from</v>

1764
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to make a fundamental</v>

1765
01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.530
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can either create some things that</v>

1766
01:30:22.531 --> 01:30:26.580
<v Speaker 2>is controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contained with specific outlines and</v>

1767
01:30:26.581 --> 01:30:28.770
<v Speaker 2>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with controlled access,</v>

1768
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.050
<v Speaker 2>permissioned access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they would call it.</v>

1769
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that by definition is not global.</v>

1770
01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.770
<v Speaker 2>It can be global.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be contained within a specific</v>

1771
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction because that's how they</v>
<v Speaker 2>operate.</v>

1772
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Both corporations and banks operate</v>
<v Speaker 2>within specific jurisdictions so they</v>

1773
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 2>can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1774
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:52.170
<v Speaker 2>but then it has to be close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation,</v>

1775
01:30:52.171 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 2>close to permission and not global and</v>
<v Speaker 2>transnational,</v>

1776
01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.890
<v Speaker 2>and so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin has a,</v>

1777
01:30:57.891 --> 01:31:02.891
<v Speaker 2>not just bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any public open cryptocurrency of a</v>

1778
01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:07.560
<v Speaker 2>global nature like bit coin is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to ask permission to join.</v>

1779
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:09.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to ask permission to</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovate.</v>

1780
01:31:09.691 --> 01:31:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to ask permission to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a new application and any</v>

1781
01:31:13.681 --> 01:31:16.290
<v Speaker 2>application,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right will instantaneously work</v>

1782
01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.960
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world to anyone without</v>
<v Speaker 2>permission.</v>

1783
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:23.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the magic of bitcoin and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that,</v>

1784
01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 2>that's also the magic of the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the internet has been</v>

1785
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 2>successful because it allows anyone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>join without permission connect to any</v>

1786
01:31:31.501 --> 01:31:32.400
<v Speaker 2>application or service.</v>

1787
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.090
<v Speaker 2>They won't write an application and</v>
<v Speaker 2>launch it globally without tasking the</v>

1788
01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:37.740
<v Speaker 2>phone company if they're allowed to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1789
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no one to ask permission from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to extend that analogy,</v>

1790
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.700
<v Speaker 2>they also tried to build private</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet and they're still trying</v>

1791
01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:53.100
<v Speaker 2>compuserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aol,</v>

1792
01:31:53.190 --> 01:31:56.700
<v Speaker 2>prodigy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the early closed networks that had</v>

1793
01:31:56.701 --> 01:31:58.590
<v Speaker 2>their own content that you could connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1794
01:31:58.591 --> 01:32:02.680
<v Speaker 2>The part of the internet and then after</v>
<v Speaker 2>that corporates internets,</v>

1795
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.700
<v Speaker 2>have you heard of the internet term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1796
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So when you have an internal network</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a company that has stale content,</v>

1797
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:13.060
<v Speaker 2>crappy applications and doesn't talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest oF the world,</v>

1798
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's behind firewalls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an intRanet,</v>

1799
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:21.950
<v Speaker 2>intra and tra and they've built those</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they sometimes serve very useful</v>

1800
01:32:22.601 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 2>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the internet And you</v>

1801
01:32:25.841 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 2>can't scale them and make them secure</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make them useful enough.</v>

1802
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So essentially that would be</v>

1803
01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:35.630
<v Speaker 1>exactly be what would happen with money</v>
<v Speaker 1>if local banks or national banks.</v>

1804
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to follow from the title,</v>

1805
01:32:39.191 --> 01:32:44.191
<v Speaker 2>the internet of money is a very powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression because it really explains</v>

1806
01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:47.590
<v Speaker 2>what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the internet of money,</v>

1807
01:32:47.591 --> 01:32:49.760
<v Speaker 2>which means it's open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>borderless global,</v>

1808
01:32:49.761 --> 01:32:53.080
<v Speaker 2>and requires no permission to</v>
<v Speaker 2>participate and people will try to</v>

1809
01:32:53.081 --> 01:32:58.081
<v Speaker 2>create the intranet of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it will have all of the limitations</v>

1810
01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:04.090
<v Speaker 2>that the traditional banking system has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

1811
01:33:04.091 --> 01:33:05.920
<v Speaker 2>they can come along and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1812
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:10.990
<v Speaker 2>and the nIce thing is that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make a choice to use one or the</v>

1813
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:15.991
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only system of monopoly we have is</v>

1814
01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:21.190
<v Speaker 2>that you have to use the national</v>
<v Speaker 2>currency of the country you were born in</v>

1815
01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:23.860
<v Speaker 2>and you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to pay the government of that</v>

1816
01:33:23.861 --> 01:33:25.690
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

1817
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you're free to use any currency you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

1818
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:30.460
<v Speaker 2>some of us are free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of us are not,</v>

1819
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 2>and bitcoin fits into that model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the if you want to use it for this</v>

1820
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:36.670
<v Speaker 2>particular use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use it</v>

1821
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:37.381
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1822
01:33:37.381 --> 01:33:39.850
<v Speaker 1>if you extrapolate where all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going,</v>

1823
01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:43.930
<v Speaker 1>if you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're correct and if over the</v>

1824
01:33:43.931 --> 01:33:48.250
<v Speaker 1>next 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin really does emerge as not just</v>

1825
01:33:48.251 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 1>an acceptable currency worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's right up there with everything</v>

1826
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 1>else and and maybe even preferred by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that are in the know or</v>

1827
01:33:57.461 --> 01:34:00.940
<v Speaker 1>tech savvy or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that really does take place,</v>

1828
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going to slowly but surely erode a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the major problems that we have</v>

1829
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.420
<v Speaker 1>with society today as far as this</v>
<v Speaker 1>government having massive amounts of</v>

1830
01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:17.881
<v Speaker 1>control over the economy and the banks</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the ones who sort of enforce the</v>

1831
01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:25.990
<v Speaker 1>kind of laws that have allowed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortgage crisis is and I'll allow these</v>

1832
01:34:25.991 --> 01:34:30.991
<v Speaker 1>bubbles to occur and also to fund and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help fund the politicians that enable</v>

1833
01:34:33.041 --> 01:34:37.580
<v Speaker 1>them to keep these laws in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of That sort of is a lot of</v>

1834
01:34:37.581 --> 01:34:42.520
<v Speaker 1>that is because of power and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that power is going to go away if</v>

1835
01:34:42.521 --> 01:34:47.521
<v Speaker 1>something like cryptocurrencies emerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being the predominant way that we use</v>

1836
01:34:48.161 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 1>and exchange money.</v>

1837
01:34:50.610 --> 01:34:52.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the optimistic way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 2>The less optimistic way to look at it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that over the decade we're going to</v>

1839
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 2>gradually move into a cashless digital</v>
<v Speaker 2>money society.</v>

1840
01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of doing that now with apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are doing that already and there are</v>

1841
01:35:08.481 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 2>some countries that are completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>cashless,</v>

1842
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:16.060
<v Speaker 2>really were that are very close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely cashless the ironically one</v>

1843
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:19.190
<v Speaker 2>of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the countries that has a very</v>

1844
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:21.840
<v Speaker 2>high degree of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1845
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.900
<v Speaker 2>digital money is Kenya because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>empaysah,</v>

1846
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 2>which is the mobile money they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has now taken over a significant</v>

1847
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:32.450
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the gdp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're also seeing in scandinavian</v>

1848
01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>countries now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cash is less than,</v>

1849
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I think is less than eight percent of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1850
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:42.530
<v Speaker 2>of the productive use of money and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>using credit cards is what you're</v>

1851
01:35:42.531 --> 01:35:45.490
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I credits debits mobile pay,</v>

1852
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is kenya's mpa?</v>

1853
01:35:47.841 --> 01:35:48.470
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1854
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And paste it as a text message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Text message money.</v>

1855
01:35:52.281 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's money you can send through sms.</v>

1856
01:35:54.261 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 2>it started off as basically people</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanging minutes,</v>

1857
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:02.210
<v Speaker 2>mobile minutes that were transferable by</v>
<v Speaker 2>sms and they started using it as</v>

1858
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 2>currency and then eventually it became</v>
<v Speaker 2>officially a corresponding currency to</v>

1859
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the kenyan pesa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Announced the predomInant currency.</v>

1860
01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:10.853
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1861
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:12.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in most places.</v>

1862
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:14.240
<v Speaker 2>From what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1863
01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been to Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've talked to a lot of kenyans who</v>

1864
01:36:16.731 --> 01:36:17.271
<v Speaker 2>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1865
01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all use that.</v>

1866
01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And only that we don't use cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't use credit cards.</v>

1867
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of shocking,</v>

1868
01:36:24.201 --> 01:36:27.950
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we are going to a digital</v>

1869
01:36:27.951 --> 01:36:32.951
<v Speaker 2>current society where cash will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually eradicated either through non</v>

1870
01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:38.291
<v Speaker 2>use or a lot of countries and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments are trying to actively ban</v>

1871
01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:42.350
<v Speaker 2>it so they're putting limits on how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use cash,</v>

1872
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 2>say you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand dollars and if it's more than</v>

1873
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 2>a thousand dollars using cash as illegal</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we go to the society,</v>

1874
01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:53.360
<v Speaker 2>we have to really think about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>

1875
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Do we want a society in which our</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital money is under complete</v>

1876
01:36:58.131 --> 01:37:03.131
<v Speaker 2>surveillance and complete control where</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the wrong protest or if you</v>

1877
01:37:03.471 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 2>support the wrong political campaign or</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make a payment to the wrong</v>

1878
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:10.040
<v Speaker 2>person or receive money from the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1879
01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:13.640
<v Speaker 2>suddenly your money disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer yours anymore.</v>

1880
01:37:13.641 --> 01:37:15.650
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's seized,</v>

1881
01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:17.040
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1882
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 2>and someone has control of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corporations,</v>

1883
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:22.430
<v Speaker 2>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>

1884
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.400
<v Speaker 2>and in most cases there is no difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between corporation,</v>

1885
01:37:25.401 --> 01:37:26.630
<v Speaker 2>bank and government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1886
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's one scenario.</v>

1887
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.550
<v Speaker 2>And the other scenario is one in which</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals control their money and it</v>

1888
01:37:34.551 --> 01:37:37.440
<v Speaker 2>is digital money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's digital cash like bitcoin,</v>

1889
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 2>where you can pay an individual from one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person to another just like I can with</v>

1890
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:44.720
<v Speaker 2>cash today without tiny other party</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting involved.</v>

1891
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:50.270
<v Speaker 2>What really strikes me as amazing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've gotten used to this idea so</v>

1892
01:37:50.271 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that we no longer pay people,</v>

1893
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:58.830
<v Speaker 2>we no longer pay people directly.</v>

1894
01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:03.570
<v Speaker 2>The less we use cash is the more we pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>people through a corporation.</v>

1895
01:38:04.230 --> 01:38:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from tipping your valet to tipping</v>

1896
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:13.191
<v Speaker 2>your taxi driver to tipping wherever</v>
<v Speaker 2>tipping is pretty much the last</v>

1897
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:18.501
<v Speaker 2>remaining part of our society and where</v>
<v Speaker 2>cash is used to pay from one person who</v>

1898
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 2>is not an incorporated entity to another</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who is not an incorporated</v>

1899
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:26.220
<v Speaker 2>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else you have to pay through</v>

1900
01:38:26.221 --> 01:38:27.960
<v Speaker 2>a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a bank,</v>

1901
01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's venmo,</v>

1902
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 2>whether it's paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's any of those things.</v>

1903
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 2>And we've gradually gotten used to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where we can't pay another</v>

1904
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 2>person unless there's a corporation</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

1905
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:44.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's astonishing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as cash disappears,</v>

1906
01:38:44.341 --> 01:38:49.341
<v Speaker 2>that then becomes a final fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single payment in your life will</v>

1907
01:38:49.951 --> 01:38:53.870
<v Speaker 2>be from you to a corporation and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation takes a piece of that every</v>

1908
01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.120
<v Speaker 2>single thing and not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just take a piece,</v>

1909
01:38:57.121 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 2>it also controls and surveils and</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitors your use.</v>

1910
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And if you violated the terms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conditions,</v>

1911
01:39:02.971 --> 01:39:05.340
<v Speaker 2>you are destitute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1912
01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.020
<v Speaker 2>So are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the issue is not what we have today</v>

1913
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:14.640
<v Speaker 2>versus the digital currency of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future or bitcoin or whatever.</v>

1914
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:19.440
<v Speaker 2>It's both futures are digital currency</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in both futures.</v>

1915
01:39:19.441 --> 01:39:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Cash will no longer exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is inevitable.</v>

1916
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:26.190
<v Speaker 2>We are going down that road and now we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to choose.</v>

1917
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Do we go to the digital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cashless society of corporate control</v>

1918
01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:35.931
<v Speaker 2>over money with the complete and total</v>
<v Speaker 2>merging of corporates and state money</v>

1919
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.880
<v Speaker 2>where instead of having separation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and money have the merging of</v>

1920
01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:46.260
<v Speaker 2>states and money and corporation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>money where your money is branded money,</v>

1921
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:51.950
<v Speaker 2>you have chase dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have goldman sachs dollars,</v>

1922
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.410
<v Speaker 2>you have coca cola dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1923
01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:59.480
<v Speaker 2>You have money that is controlled by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation or do we go down the other</v>

1924
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:04.020
<v Speaker 2>future where we have money that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically an internet protocol that is</v>

1925
01:40:04.021 --> 01:40:06.780
<v Speaker 2>completely global,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that any person can pay any person they</v>

1926
01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:10.120
<v Speaker 2>meet in the streets without any</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations getting involved just for</v>

1927
01:40:10.121 --> 01:40:14.070
<v Speaker 2>me to you digital cash and that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1928
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a less optimistic view because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully aware of what the other future is</v>

1929
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:21.720
<v Speaker 2>and it's already playing out and it is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1930
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.730
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very dangerous future.</v>

1931
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:28.530
<v Speaker 1>This is so fascinating to me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so speculative and I love when you</v>

1932
01:40:28.531 --> 01:40:31.890
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's going to happen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone presents a bunch of different</v>

1933
01:40:31.891 --> 01:40:36.891
<v Speaker 1>scenarios and you get the mind starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wander in and then you also sort of plan</v>

1934
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:40.110
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it becomes something to.</v>

1935
01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It almost become something to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to our bet on.</v>

1936
01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:45.570
<v Speaker 1>You know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1937
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's going to work like this or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>bet you because we really don't know</v>

1938
01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.020
<v Speaker 1>what I mean and what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the resistance that bitcoin is</v>

1939
01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:57.021
<v Speaker 1>facing from standard financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions that are in control right</v>

1940
01:40:57.491 --> 01:40:59.810
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there must be some form of,</v>

1941
01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 1>of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is there any fuckery involved?</v>

1942
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Like is there any sabotaging of bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been suspected or proven?</v>

1943
01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't really know if there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sabotaging going on.</v>

1944
01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's um,</v>

1945
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:18.320
<v Speaker 2>that's expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make any,</v>

1946
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:20.660
<v Speaker 2>any claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wink at me.</v>

1947
01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Tell him what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1948
01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.800
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to talk about is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>progression of what happens when a</v>

1949
01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:30.080
<v Speaker 2>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well established financial institution</v>

1950
01:41:30.081 --> 01:41:35.081
<v Speaker 2>that's been around for 50 years or 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>years is faced with a disruptor that</v>

1951
01:41:35.511 --> 01:41:40.511
<v Speaker 2>they cannot tamp down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cannot shut down sue by coopt</v>

1952
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:44.030
<v Speaker 2>eradicate band legislates against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1953
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happens then is what I call the</v>

1954
01:41:46.761 --> 01:41:51.761
<v Speaker 2>five stages of grief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First we start with denial.</v>

1955
01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:54.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1956
01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.450
<v Speaker 2>and we saw this play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think exactly like this with the</v>

1957
01:41:56.451 --> 01:41:59.000
<v Speaker 2>banking industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first reaction was denial.</v>

1958
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.390
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin can't possibly work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real money.</v>

1959
01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:05.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no value.</v>

1960
01:42:05.511 --> 01:42:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It will never survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward five years,</v>

1961
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you keep making that argument.</v>

1962
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:15.260
<v Speaker 2>It becomes less and less credible</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not real money yet.</v>

1963
01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.210
<v Speaker 2>The big metal bird that brought me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>los angeles today was paid,</v>

1964
01:42:20.211 --> 01:42:21.590
<v Speaker 2>was not money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1965
01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:28.400
<v Speaker 2>you can claim it's not money all day</v>
<v Speaker 2>long and I've been living on it for</v>

1966
01:42:28.401 --> 01:42:31.550
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kind of undermines the argument,</v>

1967
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:33.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I earn it tonight,</v>

1968
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:36.320
<v Speaker 2>spend it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people give me rides and big metal</v>

1969
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:38.000
<v Speaker 2>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's money.</v>

1970
01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that isn't working.</v>

1971
01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:43.190
<v Speaker 2>It's going to go away on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to die.</v>

1972
01:42:43.191 --> 01:42:46.880
<v Speaker 2>It's going to lose all its value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time it dumps in value,</v>

1973
01:42:46.881 --> 01:42:48.990
<v Speaker 2>they cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like finally bitcoin is dead.</v>

1974
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:52.070
<v Speaker 2>They write another obituary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we publish them on bitcoin.</v>

1975
01:42:52.071 --> 01:42:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Obituaries.com to make fun of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

1976
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Now has 110 obituaries I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

1977
01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Every time they say will die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is every two months.</v>

1978
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denial only works for a while.</v>

1979
01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Then they go into anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the money of terrorists,</v>

1980
01:43:06.561 --> 01:43:07.700
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedophiles,</v>

1981
01:43:07.701 --> 01:43:11.750
<v Speaker 2>pornographers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the unsavory elements of this world.</v>

1982
01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Pedophiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always the one they pull out,</v>

1983
01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:15.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1984
01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:17.300
<v Speaker 1>they love to use that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.070
<v Speaker 1>If they find one by one pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uses bitcoin.</v>

1986
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Pedophile kern.</v>

1987
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1988
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm dirty trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a bit of a,</v>

1989
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:30.350
<v Speaker 2>it is a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a dirty trick and they've tried</v>

1990
01:43:30.351 --> 01:43:34.420
<v Speaker 2>to do this again and again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it with the internet,</v>

1991
01:43:34.421 --> 01:43:35.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The internet,</v>

1992
01:43:35.511 --> 01:43:37.370
<v Speaker 2>when it first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1993
01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.220
<v Speaker 2>you heard this media narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1994
01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:42.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sells papers.</v>

1995
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.660
<v Speaker 2>It sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't sell clicks at the time</v>

1996
01:43:44.661 --> 01:43:46.100
<v Speaker 2>because they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the internet,</v>

1997
01:43:46.101 --> 01:43:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but it sells papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the idea that the internet is a</v>

1998
01:43:49.251 --> 01:43:52.730
<v Speaker 2>haven of crooks and fraudsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists and pedophiles and</v>

1999
01:43:52.731 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2000
01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2001
01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.220
<v Speaker 2>criminal use of advanced technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal use,</v>

2002
01:43:58.221 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>the most advanced technology they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their hands on because they're in a</v>

2003
01:44:01.941 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>very highly competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high margin,</v>

2004
01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:08.040
<v Speaker 2>high risk business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course they're going to say they</v>

2005
01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.470
<v Speaker 2>criminals wear shoes to run away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank heist criminals drive cars to get</v>

2006
01:44:12.471 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>away from bank robberies.</v>

2007
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.130
<v Speaker 2>They use cell phones to coordinate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2008
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 2>They drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is not to die of dehydration.</v>

2009
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.380
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to ban all of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2010
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have that anger.</v>

2011
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they tried that for awhile.</v>

2012
01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time they try that,</v>

2013
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you just turn around and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2014
01:44:33.291 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2015
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:39.070
<v Speaker 2>actually the biggest money launderers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs in the world are hsbc,</v>

2016
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:40.580
<v Speaker 2>the Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong,</v>

2017
01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:45.581
<v Speaker 2>shanghai banking consortium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inconvenient fact is that this is the</v>

2018
01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 2>laundry is in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2019
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:51.860
<v Speaker 2>they would call it the model new</v>
<v Speaker 2>laundering $700,000,000,000 for the</v>

2020
01:44:51.861 --> 01:44:56.660
<v Speaker 2>sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>during which 19,000 people died in</v>

2021
01:44:56.661 --> 01:45:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Mexico as a direct result of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2022
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:04.160
<v Speaker 2>and they got a fine and no one went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

2023
01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 2>So there are inconvenient facts like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2024
01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Every time they say bitcoin funds</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>

2025
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:10.363
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2026
01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I see them driving toyota's and humvees.</v>

2027
01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2028
01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

2029
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:19.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a bit incongruence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>

2030
01:45:19.161 --> 01:45:24.161
<v Speaker 2>they're driving around in the vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We left behind and there they got a lot</v>

2031
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:29.300
<v Speaker 2>of their funding from pallets of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we left behind and they're getting</v>

2032
01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:34.301
<v Speaker 2>paid for dollar in dollars for oil that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're selling to our closest allies.</v>

2033
01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't really mentioned Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

2034
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are the inconvenient truths,</v>

2035
01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:42.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't talk about these in polite</v>

2036
01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:46.430
<v Speaker 2>company or at least you do like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I said when I was invited to</v>

2037
01:45:46.431 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak in front of the senate in</v>

2038
01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Canada and they started asking me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and I said to actually mostly</v>

2039
01:45:52.671 --> 01:45:55.100
<v Speaker 2>funded by our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did they say when you do that?</v>

2040
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.630
<v Speaker 2>That was the end of that train of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

2041
01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:58.760
<v Speaker 2>They stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2042
01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:01.770
<v Speaker 2>it was live public tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

2043
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:04.420
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what went down when we moved on to</v>

2044
01:46:04.421 --> 01:46:07.010
<v Speaker 2>talk about more realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting things in a much more</v>

2045
01:46:07.011 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 2>positive view of what this thing is.</v>

2046
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:12.380
<v Speaker 2>So they tried to discredit bitcoin by</v>
<v Speaker 2>attaching it to terrorism and you</v>

2047
01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:16.520
<v Speaker 2>informed them of the facts of where</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists are actually funded from.</v>

2048
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a very public forum on live tv,</v>

2049
01:46:19.161 --> 01:46:22.490
<v Speaker 2>which was very difficult to continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>that line of conversation.</v>

2050
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a resistance in Canada?</v>

2051
01:46:27.610 --> 01:46:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Like there is in the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2052
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.010
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2053
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:31.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been very,</v>

2054
01:46:31.131 --> 01:46:33.260
<v Speaker 2>very positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very positive to,</v>

2055
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:35.000
<v Speaker 2>towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2056
01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:37.820
<v Speaker 2>towards cryptocurrencies in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of development going</v>

2058
01:46:40.011 --> 01:46:42.650
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't that much resistance in the</v>

2059
01:46:42.651 --> 01:46:43.670
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2060
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:45.950
<v Speaker 2>The banks were shutting down bank</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts.</v>

2061
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:48.980
<v Speaker 2>In some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that in the United Kingdom to</v>

2062
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:53.190
<v Speaker 2>what is the right right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the percentage of people that are</v>

2063
01:46:53.191 --> 01:46:58.191
<v Speaker 2>using bitcoin on a regular basis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to say,</v>

2064
01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily because there is no clear</v>

2065
01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:06.930
<v Speaker 2>association between one person in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin address or I can't.</v>

2066
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:10.020
<v Speaker 2>There is no account right to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use bitcoin.</v>

2067
01:47:10.021 --> 01:47:12.330
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is download an</v>
<v Speaker 2>application on your phone.</v>

2068
01:47:12.331 --> 01:47:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to register anything.</v>

2069
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:17.670
<v Speaker 2>And so as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like how many ip addresses are</v>

2070
01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:19.500
<v Speaker 2>in use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that tell you anything about how</v>

2071
01:47:19.501 --> 01:47:22.350
<v Speaker 2>many people are using the internet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really tell.</v>

2072
01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of its nature.</v>

2073
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I would say we're probably looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>about two to 4 million users based on.</v>

2074
01:47:32.221 --> 01:47:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting based on activity</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

2075
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:37.380
<v Speaker 2>based on logins to websites that some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2076
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:41.340
<v Speaker 2>the published results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to say for sure exactly</v>

2077
01:47:41.341 --> 01:47:44.280
<v Speaker 2>how many mostly concentrated in the us</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment.</v>

2078
01:47:44.281 --> 01:47:48.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's plus or minus one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the range of one percent</v>

2079
01:47:49.770 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the United States population.</v>

2080
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is globally,</v>

2081
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.180
<v Speaker 2>globally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>globally,</v>

2082
01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:56.190
<v Speaker 2>globally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe two to 4 million people.</v>

2083
01:47:56.230 --> 01:47:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You said most of them are in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

2084
01:47:57.901 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Most of them in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of them are also in China.</v>

2085
01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:02.730
<v Speaker 2>So was a $4 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>

2086
01:48:02.731 --> 01:48:05.770
<v Speaker 2>That's one percent of maybe yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

2087
01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe half a percent or something like</v>

2088
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:09.600
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2089
01:48:09.601 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is happening is it's doubling</v>

2090
01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 2>every year in terms of transaction</v>
<v Speaker 2>volume,</v>

2091
01:48:14.281 --> 01:48:18.420
<v Speaker 2>transaction amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of everything is doubling every</v>

2092
01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.130
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2093
01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:23.580
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of characteristic curve</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see in disruptive technologies being</v>

2094
01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 2>adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very promising curve.</v>

2095
01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.880
<v Speaker 2>What is the tipping point like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to happen?</v>

2096
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that needs to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2097
01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:34.530
<v Speaker 2>for widespread adoption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to need it.</v>

2098
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be ready and it's got to be</v>

2099
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:43.251
<v Speaker 2>easy to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so right now it's not easy to use.</v>

2100
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not ready for adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in many parts of the developed</v>

2101
01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:51.270
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really need it.</v>

2102
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:56.600
<v Speaker 2>So in order to make it something we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>either what we already have has to not</v>

2103
01:48:57.361 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 2>work so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's happening in the</v>

2104
01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:01.980
<v Speaker 2>developing world where you have banking</v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>

2105
01:49:01.981 --> 01:49:06.330
<v Speaker 2>which drives people into a safe haven or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you invent to applications that couldn't</v>

2106
01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:10.680
<v Speaker 2>be done before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a self driving car that you pay by the</v>

2107
01:49:10.681 --> 01:49:13.050
<v Speaker 2>mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm automatically,</v>

2108
01:49:13.051 --> 01:49:16.620
<v Speaker 2>as you're driving along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

2109
01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm a micro payments industry for paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>for contents directly.</v>

2110
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet of things where devices can</v>

2111
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.150
<v Speaker 2>buy services online automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that you can do with credit</v>

2112
01:49:30.151 --> 01:49:32.520
<v Speaker 2>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you start seeing applications</v>

2113
01:49:32.521 --> 01:49:35.520
<v Speaker 2>like that to merge and I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 2>confident they're coming because we're</v>

2114
01:49:35.521 --> 01:49:39.480
<v Speaker 2>seeing the innovation behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can make it something that is</v>

2115
01:49:39.481 --> 01:49:44.481
<v Speaker 2>more needed even in the developed world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

2116
01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:49.780
<v Speaker 2>what do you think could be done to sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of further this along or to accelerate</v>

2117
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:50.794
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

2118
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that can be done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2119
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the third ingredient is making</v>

2120
01:49:56.801 --> 01:50:00.010
<v Speaker 2>it easier for people to use and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of innovation and maturity and</v>

2121
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:00.731
<v Speaker 2>we're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2122
01:50:00.731 --> 01:50:02.190
<v Speaker 2>that's already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

2123
01:50:02.191 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have to wait and be patient</v>

2124
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>until it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What could be like the steps that can be</v>

2125
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:10.570
<v Speaker 2>taken to make something like bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to use?</v>

2126
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things to do.</v>

2127
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>user interfaces,</v>

2128
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 2>design,</v>
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>

2129
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>making backup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. Providing infrastructure services,</v>

2130
01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.720
<v Speaker 2>exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2131
01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your paycheck,</v>

2132
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:29.380
<v Speaker 2>your atm services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your debit card services,</v>

2133
01:50:30.010 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 2>merchant services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2134
01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2135
01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 2>one of the examples I like to use is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got on the internet in 1989.</v>

2136
01:50:37.090 --> 01:50:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I sent my first emails shortly</v>
<v Speaker 2>thereafter about 1990 and in order to</v>

2137
01:50:43.511 --> 01:50:47.890
<v Speaker 2>send my first email I had to have a unix</v>
<v Speaker 2>command line skills,</v>

2138
01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:52.891
<v Speaker 2>a login into a unix mainframe with</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to an internet connection at an</v>

2139
01:50:52.991 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 2>academic institution.</v>

2140
01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And then I worked very hard for about</v>
<v Speaker 2>two days to get the software working.</v>

2141
01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:03.460
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually I sent an email and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it took a couple of days to cross</v>

2142
01:51:03.461 --> 01:51:05.770
<v Speaker 2>the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2143
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And then almost exactly 20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom went,</v>

2144
01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:14.200
<v Speaker 2>swipe and did the same thing on her</v>
<v Speaker 2>ipad.</v>

2145
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:17.240
<v Speaker 2>So when you take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2146
01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:21.530
<v Speaker 2>two days of compiling software writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex unix command,</v>

2147
01:51:21.531 --> 01:51:24.340
<v Speaker 2>sending an email,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while to get across the</v>

2148
01:51:24.341 --> 01:51:29.341
<v Speaker 2>internet and then 20 years later that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to swipe when we can take a coin</v>

2149
01:51:29.351 --> 01:51:32.350
<v Speaker 2>from after install a wallet to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what it is,</v>

2150
01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:35.970
<v Speaker 2>the qr code of the bitcoin address and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I back it up and secure it,</v>

2151
01:51:35.971 --> 01:51:37.960
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you turn that into swipe.</v>

2152
01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there isn't there a vast difference</v>

2153
01:51:42.071 --> 01:51:44.740
<v Speaker 2>though between something like email,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not just a disruptive</v>

2154
01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 2>technology but a completely new</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>

2155
01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:52.000
<v Speaker 2>The ability to send things wirelessly</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the air or even wired like</v>

2156
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:57.030
<v Speaker 2>electronic mail did not exist but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But males but mail did.</v>

2157
01:51:58.541 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just a change in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium.</v>

2158
01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Essentially you're doing correspondence</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so much easier and more</v>

2159
01:52:04.271 --> 01:52:07.150
<v Speaker 2>convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like using a credit card right</v>

2160
01:52:07.151 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 2>now is fairly convenient for gas or</v>
<v Speaker 2>online banking.</v>

2161
01:52:10.630 --> 01:52:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Fairly convenient for people who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>credit cards and now that's,</v>

2162
01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.710
<v Speaker 2>that's where the numbers really benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin because we're,</v>

2163
01:52:17.711 --> 01:52:21.640
<v Speaker 2>we're in the age of the internet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of economic inclusion becoming</v>

2164
01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:25.660
<v Speaker 2>crater instead of more people around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world having ready access to these</v>

2165
01:52:25.661 --> 01:52:28.870
<v Speaker 2>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing entire country's getting</v>

2166
01:52:28.871 --> 01:52:32.620
<v Speaker 2>cut off from economic inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The banking system is not expanding as</v>

2167
01:52:32.621 --> 01:52:37.330
<v Speaker 2>fast to reach these populations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this vast gap left and this</v>

2168
01:52:37.331 --> 01:52:41.380
<v Speaker 2>gap is several billion people into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap.</v>

2169
01:52:41.410 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 2>You can fit anyone who has access to</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a rudimentary,</v>

2170
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 2>a feature phone or smartphone with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very basic level of data service.</v>

2171
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the level at which you need to have</v>

2172
01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>technology in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone to adopt bitcoin and</v>

2173
01:52:58.581 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 2>immediately become in themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a global bank in the back pocket of</v>

2174
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:08.561
<v Speaker 2>their pants compare to the level that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would need to reach before jpmorgan</v>

2175
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:16.510
<v Speaker 2>chase built a branch within their area</v>
<v Speaker 2>and offer them services after going</v>

2176
01:53:17.751 --> 01:53:20.890
<v Speaker 2>through a very careful verification of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their identity and blah,</v>

2177
01:53:20.891 --> 01:53:21.201
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2178
01:53:21.201 --> 01:53:21.800
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

2179
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.970
<v Speaker 2>That's never gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to get to leapfrogging</v>

2180
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like in many places in africa.</v>

2181
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:33.230
<v Speaker 2>The first leapfrog a event we saw that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was noted upon people wrote books about</v>

2182
01:53:33.231 --> 01:53:36.140
<v Speaker 2>this is the fact that in many places in</v>
<v Speaker 2>africa,</v>

2183
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:41.470
<v Speaker 2>landlines were never deployed because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the difficulty to actually extend</v>

2184
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.740
<v Speaker 2>landlines was so high that when cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones came along,</v>

2185
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.730
<v Speaker 2>at some point it became easier to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>go directly to cell phones and bypass</v>

2186
01:53:49.731 --> 01:53:52.670
<v Speaker 2>that entire generation of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2187
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.000
<v Speaker 2>So we're expecting an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly see it as very possible to</v>

2188
01:53:58.071 --> 01:54:00.650
<v Speaker 2>see a leap frogging and economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusion,</v>

2189
01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the ability for people to join the</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet of money long before they ever</v>

2190
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:09.020
<v Speaker 2>see a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end result is it's not just about</v>

2191
01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 2>banking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unbanked,</v>

2192
01:54:11.481 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 2>it's about debunking all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Banking is an application.</v>

2193
01:54:15.051 --> 01:54:19.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't need an institution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just need an application.</v>

2194
01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And that that transition is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

2195
01:54:22.230 --> 01:54:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Is there any concern that people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take people's phones and hold them at</v>

2196
01:54:25.441 --> 01:54:27.690
<v Speaker 1>gunpoint and just steal all their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin?</v>

2197
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if that's all you own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a wallet,</v>

2198
01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:34.390
<v Speaker 1>that wallet is all you own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on bitcoin 20 years from now,</v>

2199
01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:37.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's your entire financial</v>

2200
01:54:37.681 --> 01:54:41.520
<v Speaker 1>portfolio exists in your phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can come along and force you at</v>

2201
01:54:41.521 --> 01:54:44.250
<v Speaker 1>gunpoint to transfer that over their</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and then they take off in the</v>

2202
01:54:44.251 --> 01:54:44.830
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

2203
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2204
01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all already today,</v>

2205
01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't keep your entire financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>portfolio on your phone.</v>

2206
01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2207
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:57.580
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of very convenient</v>
<v Speaker 2>and easy to use devices that allow you</v>

2208
01:54:57.581 --> 01:55:02.050
<v Speaker 2>to store your bitcoin securely on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>offline device.</v>

2209
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of my bag,</v>

2210
01:55:04.091 --> 01:55:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I might show them to you later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might,</v>

2211
01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:09.220
<v Speaker 2>but you might not mean if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>show them to you now,</v>

2212
01:55:09.221 --> 01:55:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you might just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2213
01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:11.163
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

2214
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:16.510
<v Speaker 1>The way you said it was just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>teasing me.</v>

2215
01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.290
<v Speaker 1>This is for people at home that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this.</v>

2216
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of this.</v>

2217
01:55:25.630 --> 01:55:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to get wrapped up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2218
01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:32.080
<v Speaker 2>headphones for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>

2219
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:35.950
<v Speaker 2>So this is a device that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in bitcoin are familiar with.</v>

2220
01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Can we see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is called a bitcoin tresor.</v>

2222
01:55:40.170 --> 01:55:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It looks like one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those old ladies press when they fall</v>

2223
01:55:42.421 --> 01:55:43.560
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2224
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I've fallen</v>

2225
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 2>and I can't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2226
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:49.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2227
01:55:49.921 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>so this is a usb device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can connect it to my computer.</v>

2228
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.061
<v Speaker 2>Can I see it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2229
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:55.130
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2230
01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 2>all your money now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel weird.</v>

2231
01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't have all my money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have got it.</v>

2232
01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:04.140
<v Speaker 2>So I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a backup of that device and this</v>

2233
01:56:04.141 --> 01:56:08.040
<v Speaker 2>is where what I mentioned before is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 to 24 word backup that I have,</v>

2234
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:11.380
<v Speaker 2>which means that if I lose that device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2235
01:56:11.490 --> 01:56:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I can recreate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on my backup device which I'm</v>

2236
01:56:15.841 --> 01:56:16.720
<v Speaker 2>carrying here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

2237
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.120
<v Speaker 2>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a second one.</v>

2238
01:56:18.121 --> 01:56:23.121
<v Speaker 2>I actually have four of these and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can transfer that 24 words seed to any</v>

2239
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 2>device you want and it will immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>have access to all of your money.</v>

2240
01:56:26.881 --> 01:56:28.320
<v Speaker 2>It would render this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2241
01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2242
01:56:30.241 --> 01:56:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean it won't render this one now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it can coexist on all of them,</v>

2243
01:56:33.271 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 2>but that one has a pin number and a pass</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase that you have to put in.</v>

2244
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:40.370
<v Speaker 2>He would not be able to break into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>device could.</v>

2245
01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe most people can't.</v>

2246
01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm good at that shit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2247
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is it possible that someone could</v>

2248
01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:53.010
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to crack your 24 word</v>
<v Speaker 2>code?</v>

2249
01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:54.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2250
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:55.740
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say that man,</v>

2251
01:56:55.741 --> 01:56:56.920
<v Speaker 2>don't say that online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2252
01:56:56.950 --> 01:57:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I say that fucking hackers man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take that shit as a challenge.</v>

2253
01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Never say you can't hack me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

2254
01:57:03.130 --> 01:57:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin in itself is the world's largest</v>
<v Speaker 2>bug bounty and this is something that</v>

2255
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:14.930
<v Speaker 2>most people have been realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bounty a bug bounty is when a</v>

2256
01:57:14.941 --> 01:57:17.520
<v Speaker 2>manufacturer of a piece of software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2257
01:57:17.521 --> 01:57:21.510
<v Speaker 2>puts out a bunting bounty and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a $10,000 if you find a</v>

2258
01:57:21.511 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 2>bug in my software that someone could</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploit to break my software.</v>

2259
01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Apple does bug bounties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google does bug bounties.</v>

2260
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:30.690
<v Speaker 2>A lot of companies do these bug</v>
<v Speaker 2>bounties.</v>

2261
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:33.870
<v Speaker 2>It's very wise and it's great because</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do is that way they.</v>

2262
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:37.080
<v Speaker 2>They find these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have professional packers really</v>

2263
01:57:37.081 --> 01:57:39.660
<v Speaker 2>who go in and break the software and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's legal.</v>

2264
01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.480
<v Speaker 2>They do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2265
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:46.410
<v Speaker 2>but another way to look at this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin has 10 to $12,000,000,000 of</v>

2266
01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:50.040
<v Speaker 2>market capitalization behind it and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find a way to break,</v>

2267
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.390
<v Speaker 2>say my 24 words seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have access to my money,</v>

2268
01:57:54.391 --> 01:57:59.391
<v Speaker 2>so my money is the bounty that sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind that bug and this means that</v>

2269
01:58:00.301 --> 01:58:05.301
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is being tested and has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested every single day of his seven</v>

2270
01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:08.880
<v Speaker 2>year existence with an ever increasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>jack bolt at the end of it,</v>

2271
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 2>which is why you see bitcoin exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they don't do good security,</v>

2272
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:18.000
<v Speaker 2>they get hacked and whoever hacks them</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets the bounty,</v>

2273
01:58:18.001 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 2>but bitcoin itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has the biggest bounty of them all</v>

2274
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.650
<v Speaker 2>remains secure and the reason to remain</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure,</v>

2275
01:58:25.730 --> 01:58:26.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not magical.</v>

2276
01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It's about spreading out the risk in</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a way that there is no single</v>

2277
01:58:30.931 --> 01:58:33.450
<v Speaker 2>points you can put your thumb on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

2278
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:35.280
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little device,</v>

2279
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 2>these types of devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ones that have a fingerprint</v>

2280
01:58:39.481 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 2>scanner on them that are easy to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>there or they come in various form</v>

2281
01:58:44.021 --> 01:58:46.330
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call these hardware wallets.</v>

2282
01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:51.340
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the bitcoin keys that control my</v>

2283
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:56.341
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin are created on this device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They remain on this device and this</v>

2284
01:58:56.681 --> 01:59:01.390
<v Speaker 2>device signs transactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I can take it and I can plug</v>

2285
01:59:01.391 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it into this laptop and if this laptop</v>
<v Speaker 2>is compromised,</v>

2286
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will not be able to compromise this.</v>

2287
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I can take this and I can plug it in to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2288
01:59:12.131 --> 01:59:16.900
<v Speaker 2>you know those desktops they have in</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel lobbies where you can print your</v>

2289
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:18.730
<v Speaker 2>boarding pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2290
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Consider that the cesspool of computing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2291
01:59:22.190 --> 01:59:25.800
<v Speaker 2>You go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing has 25 different viruses</v>

2292
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.490
<v Speaker 2>fighting for dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2293
01:59:28.090 --> 01:59:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Once you plug into device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start tearing each other apart,</v>

2294
01:59:32.111 --> 01:59:36.520
<v Speaker 2>trying to get to your device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can plug this in there and make a</v>

2295
01:59:36.521 --> 01:59:40.390
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin transaction and not have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about that because the keys stay</v>

2296
01:59:40.391 --> 01:59:42.220
<v Speaker 2>on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2297
01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:44.140
<v Speaker 2>And no one can figure out a virus for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>

2298
01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

2299
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:48.520
<v Speaker 2>This is designed specifically to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2300
01:59:48.521 --> 01:59:53.521
<v Speaker 2>very narrow well defined interface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only thing you can send to it is</v>

2301
01:59:53.951 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 2>a bitcoin transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It then displays that bitcoin</v>

2302
01:59:56.741 --> 01:59:59.380
<v Speaker 2>transaction on the screen and I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

2303
01:59:59.381 --> 02:00:01.600
<v Speaker 2>is that who I actually wanted to pay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2304
02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Confirm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I've paid them and nobody else.</v>

2305
02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Is it impossible to integrate a virus</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a bitcoin transaction code messages</v>

2306
02:00:09.851 --> 02:00:12.280
<v Speaker 2>and certain software or wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2307
02:00:12.281 --> 02:00:13.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>al qaeda was doing.</v>

2308
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>They were sending pictures and inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual digital image,</v>

2309
02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:21.580
<v Speaker 2>the ones and zeros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were encoding actual information</v>

2310
02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:25.600
<v Speaker 2>that you could read and you can embed</v>
<v Speaker 2>data differences.</v>

2311
02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:29.830
<v Speaker 2>You can't execute that data because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing will not execute the data it</v>

2312
02:00:29.831 --> 02:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>receives in the transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It simply runs a fingerprint function on</v>

2313
02:00:34.391 --> 02:00:37.960
<v Speaker 2>it and signs it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

2314
02:00:38.210 --> 02:00:41.800
<v Speaker 2>the point of this is that jamie's</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredulous look at them.</v>

2315
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like it's,</v>

2316
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you're setting a rule that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken in a month.</v>

2317
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2318
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but next week we figured it out and now</v>

2319
02:00:51.761 --> 02:00:53.020
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2320
02:00:53.021 --> 02:00:53.561
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2321
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I've had this device now for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2322
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the first additions.</v>

2323
02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2324
02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I keep my bitcoin on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2325
02:01:02.650 --> 02:01:07.390
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't had a problem yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't put my money on exchanges.</v>

2326
02:01:07.391 --> 02:01:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I keep it on devices like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I haven't had low money</v>

2327
02:01:10.811 --> 02:01:11.644
<v Speaker 2>stolen.</v>

2328
02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 2>The point of this is not to make it more</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure,</v>

2329
02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:19.030
<v Speaker 2>although it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to make security easy for someone</v>

2330
02:01:19.031 --> 02:01:22.480
<v Speaker 2>who's not technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could create a whole elaborate system</v>

2331
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:25.540
<v Speaker 2>as security experts to secure my</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoins.</v>

2332
02:01:25.541 --> 02:01:29.170
<v Speaker 2>That was never a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point of this devices that you can</v>

2333
02:01:29.171 --> 02:01:31.630
<v Speaker 2>secure your bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mum could insecure her bitcoin</v>

2334
02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:35.710
<v Speaker 2>without really knowing how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just simply following how this</v>

2335
02:01:35.711 --> 02:01:39.220
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it takes security packages,</v>

2336
02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:41.870
<v Speaker 2>attendant device and simplifies it</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically.</v>

2337
02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

2338
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other question you asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens if someone points a gun at</v>

2339
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:49.274
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2340
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:52.870
<v Speaker 2>We call that the $5 wrench solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2341
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:55.100
<v Speaker 2>should we build a $10,000 super.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2342
02:01:55.101 --> 02:01:59.810
<v Speaker 2>it's from a cartoon by randall monroe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and xkcd says,</v>

2343
02:01:59.811 --> 02:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>should we build a 10,000 supercomputer</v>
<v Speaker 2>to crack his encryption?</v>

2344
02:02:03.490 --> 02:02:04.101
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2345
02:02:04.101 --> 02:02:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Here's a $5 wrench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just beat him until he tells you what</v>

2346
02:02:06.591 --> 02:02:07.424
<v Speaker 2>the password is.</v>

2347
02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so resistance to that is difficult,</v>

2348
02:02:13.911 --> 02:02:17.540
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that these devices</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in an all the systems in bitcoin</v>

2349
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>have is duress passwords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can put a small amount of bitcoin</v>

2350
02:02:22.071 --> 02:02:26.250
<v Speaker 2>in a specific accounts that opens with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different password and so shouldn't know</v>

2351
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:29.900
<v Speaker 2>so that people know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the mother fucker.</v>

2352
02:02:29.901 --> 02:02:32.060
<v Speaker 2>You gave me the duress password.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2353
02:02:32.061 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know which one is which.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a well known technique and</v>

2354
02:02:36.381 --> 02:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>we absolutely recommend using that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>

2355
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I go to a country,</v>

2356
02:02:43.450 --> 02:02:45.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where security isn't as good,</v>

2357
02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:51.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry my cash in a money belt or leave</v>

2358
02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:56.831
<v Speaker 2>it back at the hotel in a safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also carry a bundle of notes,</v>

2359
02:02:56.871 --> 02:02:58.880
<v Speaker 2>high value notes like the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2360
02:02:58.881 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 2>$50 here in the United States in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>front pocket.</v>

2361
02:03:03.110 --> 02:03:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And if somebody comes at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls out a knife and says,</v>

2362
02:03:06.531 --> 02:03:11.531
<v Speaker 2>give me your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will hand them my phone is a throwaway</v>

2363
02:03:11.691 --> 02:03:12.050
<v Speaker 2>cash.</v>

2364
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:14.840
<v Speaker 2>I haven't in my front pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I will walk away from that.</v>

2365
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Listen to this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to know this motherfucker</v>

2366
02:03:17.451 --> 02:03:19.480
<v Speaker 2>as a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's real ludas.</v>

2367
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:20.660
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2368
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:23.660
<v Speaker 2>So I mean this is something a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do,</v>

2369
02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:24.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2370
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why roberts are aware of it.</v>

2371
02:03:28.190 --> 02:03:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part they'll take the</v>

2372
02:03:30.171 --> 02:03:32.070
<v Speaker 2>cash that you hand them in runaway</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

2373
02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2374
02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I can't help thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although these little devices that</v>

2375
02:03:36.951 --> 02:03:40.430
<v Speaker 2>you're storing your bitcoin on look</v>
<v Speaker 2>elegant in 2016,</v>

2376
02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I can't help thinking that they're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be like those gordon gekko</v>

2377
02:03:43.401 --> 02:03:46.160
<v Speaker 2>giant brick phones when he was walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the beach looking like a pimp</v>

2378
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:48.440
<v Speaker 2>from wall street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that movie that they are,</v>

2379
02:03:48.441 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's holding that big ass.</v>

2380
02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.230
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people will be watching this show,</v>

2381
02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a decade from now laughing at laughing</v>

2382
02:03:57.261 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>at those things.</v>

2383
02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:59.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because guess what,</v>

2384
02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found a photo yesterday.</v>

2385
02:04:00.811 --> 02:04:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I was looking through some of my files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found a photo of me.</v>

2386
02:04:03.710 --> 02:04:04.543
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2387
02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Look at him like a pimp with that big</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid phone.</v>

2388
02:04:09.170 --> 02:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I found a photo of me on the 1991 with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leather,</v>

2389
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:19.990
<v Speaker 2>a side carrier with one of those in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>holster,</v>

2390
02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those brick phones.</v>

2391
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it was second generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motorola was about this big document,</v>

2392
02:04:27.081 --> 02:04:29.660
<v Speaker 2>like ruin your hip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all that weight.</v>

2393
02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:30.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

2394
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2395
02:04:32.241 --> 02:04:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a sophomore in college.</v>

2396
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:39.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like 1991 first cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just come out.</v>

2397
02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm in computer science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a geek.</v>

2398
02:04:41.221 --> 02:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I love gadgets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go by one of the first cell phones.</v>

2399
02:04:43.691 --> 02:04:48.090
<v Speaker 2>It cost me an arm and a leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid like $5 a minute to make calls on</v>

2400
02:04:48.091 --> 02:04:49.890
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like $2,000,</v>

2401
02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:54.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I paid something like 750 pounds</v>

2402
02:04:54.151 --> 02:04:57.420
<v Speaker 2>sterling at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably about a thousand bucks for</v>

2403
02:04:57.421 --> 02:04:59.940
<v Speaker 2>a thing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's battery lasted an hour.</v>

2404
02:05:03.150 --> 02:05:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so terrible.</v>

2405
02:05:04.711 --> 02:05:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fantastic photo of me with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leather holster with that.</v>

2406
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>My and I looked so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I see it?</v>

2407
02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:12.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have it with me.</v>

2408
02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a physical photo</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

2409
02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I actually found the physical photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't digitized them yet.</v>

2410
02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:19.650
<v Speaker 2>When you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please send it my way.</v>

2411
02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:20.431
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2412
02:05:20.431 --> 02:05:25.431
<v Speaker 2>It was straight up on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also have poofy hair in the front and</v>

2413
02:05:25.741 --> 02:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing a ridiculous shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were pimpin 1991.</v>

2414
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 90 nature college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2415
02:05:33.110 --> 02:05:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

2416
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will look ridiculous.</v>

2417
02:05:36.961 --> 02:05:41.961
<v Speaker 2>But the point that you make so well is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we did go from gordon gecko to the</v>

2418
02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:48.980
<v Speaker 2>right and and we're going to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>again in the bitcoin technology.</v>

2419
02:05:49.891 --> 02:05:51.510
<v Speaker 2>This isn't something that's standing</v>
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

2420
02:05:51.511 --> 02:05:53.520
<v Speaker 2>The amount of innovation that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening today,</v>

2421
02:05:53.521 --> 02:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>even though it's not mainstream yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is staggering.</v>

2422
02:05:56.820 --> 02:06:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I work in this space full time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I do is read about what is new in</v>

2423
02:06:00.901 --> 02:06:04.320
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin and that's a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are there like you?</v>

2424
02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Are you the only one like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2425
02:06:06.090 --> 02:06:07.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>

2426
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>The only one who's this integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2427
02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:13.140
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There a bunch of people like you.</v>

2428
02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably about a thousand people</v>

2429
02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:18.000
<v Speaker 2>like you who are doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2430
02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Who were living off bitcoin constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating big corn,</v>

2431
02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:25.050
<v Speaker 2>reading about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lecturing and writing books about</v>

2432
02:06:25.051 --> 02:06:25.710
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2433
02:06:25.710 --> 02:06:29.100
<v Speaker 2>not so many lecturing and writing books</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it or speaking of conferences,</v>

2434
02:06:29.101 --> 02:06:32.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's 100 to 200 who are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

2435
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred to 200.</v>

2436
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you should talk to the other 199.</v>

2437
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they make better guests out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

2438
02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:42.931
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2439
02:06:42.931 --> 02:06:43.764
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2440
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming any special mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2441
02:06:45.661 --> 02:06:49.350
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of people who are very much</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it as I am and it is a full time</v>

2442
02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:51.570
<v Speaker 2>job and because so much is happening.</v>

2443
02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:52.321
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2444
02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:55.080
<v Speaker 2>These devices will seem antiquated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What this shows,</v>

2445
02:06:55.081 --> 02:06:58.260
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when I came on the show the</v>

2446
02:06:58.261 --> 02:07:00.690
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about three years ago,</v>

2447
02:07:01.410 --> 02:07:05.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't yet have one of these and I</v>

2448
02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:09.330
<v Speaker 2>used to store my bitcoin on what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>called a paper wallet,</v>

2449
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>which is basically where I print out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>digital keys with a convoluted process</v>

2450
02:07:15.181 --> 02:07:18.530
<v Speaker 2>to make sure my computer that's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the printing isn't compromised because</v>

2451
02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:22.440
<v Speaker 2>then they're compromised and then send</v>
<v Speaker 2>the money to those digital keys and then</v>

2452
02:07:22.441 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 2>put those in a vault in a safe deposit</v>
<v Speaker 2>box in a,</v>

2453
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:28.590
<v Speaker 2>in a safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that worked great for two years.</v>

2454
02:07:28.591 --> 02:07:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I kept a small amount of bitcoin safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

2455
02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a lot of expertise to execute on</v>

2456
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:39.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were many ways to get it</v>

2457
02:07:39.311 --> 02:07:41.620
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've progressed.</v>

2458
02:07:41.621 --> 02:07:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Now the way you back this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you write down 24 english words,</v>

2459
02:07:46.241 --> 02:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>like how hard is that?</v>

2460
02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:50.470
<v Speaker 2>That it shows to you one at a time on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the screen and it tells you,</v>

2461
02:07:50.471 --> 02:07:54.910
<v Speaker 2>write them down a runs with software in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a website which has really three or four</v>

2462
02:07:54.911 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 2>buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fairly easy to use.</v>

2463
02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:01.300
<v Speaker 2>The device itself has two buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably teach my mom how to use</v>

2464
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:04.330
<v Speaker 2>this and she owns bitcoin so that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be useful.</v>

2465
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.460
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she owns one of these</v>

2466
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:11.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably only use it when you're</v>

2467
02:08:11.801 --> 02:08:12.760
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2468
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't use it or get out my little</v>

2469
02:08:16.421 --> 02:08:20.880
<v Speaker 2>goofy fucking bitcoin thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me pretend I use this for a.</v>

2470
02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:23.200
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't humor me that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2471
02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:24.133
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2472
02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:25.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2473
02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:30.790
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is that five years from</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this is going to be even simpler and</v>

2474
02:08:30.791 --> 02:08:34.000
<v Speaker 2>we keep iterating and maturing of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

2475
02:08:34.001 --> 02:08:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not standing still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as it gets easier and easier,</v>

2476
02:08:37.151 --> 02:08:38.470
<v Speaker 2>more people come on board.</v>

2477
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Not only are they able to use bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other cryptocurrencies,</v>

2478
02:08:43.031 --> 02:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>but they're able to do it with security</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that doesn't require an</v>

2479
02:08:47.211 --> 02:08:50.110
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the same.</v>

2480
02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:53.980
<v Speaker 2>This happened with the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this fantastic show you see</v>

2481
02:08:53.981 --> 02:08:58.330
<v Speaker 2>in 1994 and they've got good morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>America and there's this clip from the</v>

2482
02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.870
<v Speaker 2>outtakes they're doing before they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this big internet story.</v>

2483
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:05.740
<v Speaker 2>And they have the host chatting amongst</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves before they started story and</v>

2484
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:08.470
<v Speaker 2>one of them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is the intranet?</v>

2485
02:09:08.471 --> 02:09:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>email?</v>

2486
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:10.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2487
02:09:10.721 --> 02:09:11.081
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2488
02:09:11.081 --> 02:09:14.350
<v Speaker 2>That's just email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the outside is the internet.</v>

2489
02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:14.741
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2490
02:09:14.741 --> 02:09:15.041
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2491
02:09:15.041 --> 02:09:18.280
<v Speaker 2>The outside is email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the www.</v>

2492
02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:23.000
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's intranet and dotcom.</v>

2493
02:09:23.050 --> 02:09:26.560
<v Speaker 2>That's internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's going through this process</v>

2494
02:09:26.561 --> 02:09:31.561
<v Speaker 2>where they're trying to grasp this alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>and strange seeming technology and all</v>

2495
02:09:33.131 --> 02:09:37.900
<v Speaker 2>of the terminology is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's play this.</v>

2496
02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.290
<v Speaker 4>As I was doing that little tease with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the a and then the ring around it.</v>

2497
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:47.800
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm katie said she thought it was about,</v>

2498
02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:53.480
<v Speaker 4>but I've never heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never heard of mark but never heard it</v>

2499
02:09:53.490 --> 02:09:55.440
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it sounded stupid what I said</v>

2500
02:09:55.441 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 4>and violence at nbc</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the lunch room.</v>

2501
02:10:00.190 --> 02:10:05.190
<v Speaker 4>So there is violence@nbcg.com.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean alison should know what</v>

2502
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.600
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That massive computer network.</v>

2503
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:16.580
<v Speaker 4>The one that's becoming really big now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean you.</v>

2504
02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:18.570
<v Speaker 4>How does one know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you right to it?</v>

2505
02:10:18.571 --> 02:10:20.640
<v Speaker 4>Like male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now a lot of people use it and</v>

2506
02:10:20.641 --> 02:10:22.950
<v Speaker 4>communicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they can communicate with nbc</v>

2507
02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:24.360
<v Speaker 4>writers and producers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allison,</v>

2508
02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:28.260
<v Speaker 4>can you explain what internet is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can't say anything in 10 seconds or</v>

2509
02:10:28.261 --> 02:10:31.950
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alison will be in the studio shortly.</v>

2510
02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:32.803
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2511
02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:36.680
<v Speaker 4>A giant computer network made up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made up of a startup from.</v>

2512
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:40.320
<v Speaker 4>Tell us what this was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not an.</v>

2513
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:41.790
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2514
02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:44.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a computer billboard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's wide and it's several</v>

2515
02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:48.890
<v Speaker 4>universities and everything all joined</v>
<v Speaker 4>together and others could access it and</v>

2516
02:10:48.891 --> 02:10:52.040
<v Speaker 4>it's getting bigger and bigger role.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just correct it during the quake.</v>

2517
02:10:52.041 --> 02:10:54.050
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they were communicating out</v>

2518
02:10:54.051 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 4>to tell family and loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were okay because all the phone</v>

2519
02:10:56.361 --> 02:10:58.430
<v Speaker 4>lines were down and I was telling katie</v>
<v Speaker 4>taught me,</v>

2520
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:00.300
<v Speaker 4>you don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to fall in line to</v>

2521
02:11:00.301 --> 02:11:01.320
<v Speaker 4>operate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2522
02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.060
<v Speaker 3>so can you show this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2523
02:11:06.250 --> 02:11:08.290
<v Speaker 3>If you show this to a millennial right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2524
02:11:08.291 --> 02:11:09.840
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2525
02:11:10.210 --> 02:11:12.460
<v Speaker 3>94.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just before the civil war,</v>

2526
02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:14.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is 18.</v>

2527
02:11:14.861 --> 02:11:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Is it 18?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety four.</v>

2528
02:11:16.061 --> 02:11:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Slavery was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2529
02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.740
<v Speaker 3>They had back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they can't even conceive of a</v>

2530
02:11:20.741 --> 02:11:25.741
<v Speaker 3>time when the internet was just so</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely impossible to understand.</v>

2531
02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:30.310
<v Speaker 3>I feel very fortunate that I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 3>without it and got to experience it in</v>

2532
02:11:30.311 --> 02:11:34.750
<v Speaker 3>my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I experienced it emerge and I was like,</v>

2533
02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:36.310
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

2534
02:11:36.311 --> 02:11:41.170
<v Speaker 3>But it didn't really have the same sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of impact on my life that it has on the</v>

2535
02:11:41.171 --> 02:11:45.450
<v Speaker 3>lives of young people today that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up with a word there.</v>

2536
02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at kids today,</v>

2537
02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:50.500
<v Speaker 3>you go to a store or go to the mall or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that and they go to a</v>

2538
02:11:50.501 --> 02:11:52.300
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking glued to their phone.</v>

2539
02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:54.450
<v Speaker 3>They're glued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2540
02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Here comes the prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This generation,</v>

2541
02:11:56.921 --> 02:12:00.580
<v Speaker 3>which is growing up right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd never know a world without</v>

2542
02:12:00.581 --> 02:12:04.060
<v Speaker 3>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also never know a world without</v>

2543
02:12:04.061 --> 02:12:08.650
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now 15 to 18 years from now,</v>

2544
02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.700
<v Speaker 3>none of them are going to get a driver's</v>
<v Speaker 3>license because there will be no self</v>

2545
02:12:12.701 --> 02:12:17.680
<v Speaker 3>driving cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need one wouldn't be fucking Montana</v>

2546
02:12:17.681 --> 02:12:20.440
<v Speaker 3>where I could drive my own goddamn car</v>
<v Speaker 3>hobby,</v>

2547
02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:23.830
<v Speaker 3>a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be a hobby and you'll pay $3,000</v>

2548
02:12:23.831 --> 02:12:25.990
<v Speaker 3>a month in insurance to drive your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

2549
02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:28.900
<v Speaker 3>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll see.</v>

2550
02:12:28.901 --> 02:12:30.700
<v Speaker 3>That's where it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

2551
02:12:30.701 --> 02:12:32.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans behind the wheel,</v>

2552
02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.270
<v Speaker 3>grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds insane.</v>

2553
02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Thousand dollars a month didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

2554
02:12:37.091 --> 02:12:38.950
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be telling your</v>
<v Speaker 3>grandchildren.</v>

2555
02:12:38.951 --> 02:12:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use to drive our own cars.</v>

2556
02:12:40.451 --> 02:12:43.360
<v Speaker 3>They say that sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did hundreds of thousands of people die</v>

2557
02:12:43.361 --> 02:12:44.194
<v Speaker 3>every year?</v>

2558
02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we live like men.</v>

2559
02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:51.670
<v Speaker 3>We didn't live in this digital dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all these other pussies out there.</v>

2560
02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:52.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

2561
02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:57.850
<v Speaker 3>But think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine a child born today that never</v>

2562
02:12:57.851 --> 02:12:59.630
<v Speaker 3>sees cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2563
02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Unless they traveled to another country</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're backwards and they still</v>

2564
02:13:03.641 --> 02:13:06.490
<v Speaker 3>use paper as money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2565
02:13:06.491 --> 02:13:07.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible.</v>

2566
02:13:07.991 --> 02:13:11.560
<v Speaker 3>So what seems inconceivable to us then</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes the norm.</v>

2567
02:13:11.710 --> 02:13:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Then it becomes inconceivable to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>without it.</v>

2568
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're trying to explain,</v>

2569
02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:21.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what consensus algorithm did the</v>

2570
02:13:21.491 --> 02:13:22.840
<v Speaker 3>federal reserve use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2571
02:13:22.841 --> 02:13:27.310
<v Speaker 3>it's used the 12 white dudes decide for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you consensus.</v>

2572
02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 3>What is a</v>

2573
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>proof of work algorithm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2574
02:13:33.721 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 2>no johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a proof of war algorithm backed</v>

2575
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:37.554
<v Speaker 2>by oil.</v>

2576
02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I am happy you exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love having you on the show.</v>

2577
02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I love talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that you have this</v>

2578
02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:48.800
<v Speaker 1>beautiful vision of digital currency and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it works,</v>

2579
02:13:48.850 --> 02:13:52.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're correct and it all pans out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be amazing.</v>

2580
02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know so much about it.</v>

2581
02:13:55.211 --> 02:13:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on here and educate us.</v>

2582
02:13:57.311 --> 02:14:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I love that every time you come on there</v>
<v Speaker 1>really does seem to be more and more</v>

2583
02:14:01.691 --> 02:14:03.430
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is tangible.</v>

2584
02:14:03.431 --> 02:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's trackable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting and it's fascinating</v>

2585
02:14:07.090 --> 02:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>and I'm all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on team bitcoin.</v>

2586
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted it to happen,</v>

2587
02:14:14.110 --> 02:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's just one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2588
02:14:15.731 --> 02:14:20.731
<v Speaker 1>It's just entirely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until it absolutely is here,</v>

2589
02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:24.490
<v Speaker 1>like credit cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the car,</v>

2590
02:14:24.670 --> 02:14:28.240
<v Speaker 1>like all the other things that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing that really didn't exist</v>

2591
02:14:28.241 --> 02:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>before and now exist almost primarily.</v>

2592
02:14:31.090 --> 02:14:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>

2593
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:33.763
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2594
02:14:34.090 --> 02:14:37.600
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely amazing and fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2595
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:43.470
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways it's a solution for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>control that the federal government,</v>

2596
02:14:44.801 --> 02:14:47.680
<v Speaker 1>the federal reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bank's end,</v>

2597
02:14:47.681 --> 02:14:51.820
<v Speaker 1>even politicians have over us today that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can control,</v>

2598
02:14:51.821 --> 02:14:54.820
<v Speaker 1>is slowly being eroded by the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even slowly,</v>

2599
02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.390
<v Speaker 1>pretty rapidly being eroded by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet even whenever control</v>

2600
02:14:58.391 --> 02:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>politicians used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not nearly as.</v>

2601
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:06.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not nearly as easy to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more transparent.</v>

2602
02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:10.630
<v Speaker 1>It's so much easier to protest today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different realm.</v>

2603
02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:14.110
<v Speaker 1>We're living in a different world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world is happening incredibly</v>

2604
02:15:14.111 --> 02:15:18.910
<v Speaker 1>rapidly from a I got on in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were on before then when it was like</v>

2605
02:15:18.911 --> 02:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>this really fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange internet.</v>

2606
02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were in the early days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really fascinated to see what it's</v>

2607
02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:28.480
<v Speaker 1>going to be like 20 years from now and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do hope you're right.</v>

2608
02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the beautiful things about</v>

2609
02:15:32.931 --> 02:15:37.310
<v Speaker 2>this is I think if you've experienced</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like this before,</v>

2610
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:42.370
<v Speaker 2>and we're very lucky to be part of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation where we have advancements in</v>

2611
02:15:42.801 --> 02:15:46.430
<v Speaker 2>technology happening at a rate where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't just see one or two,</v>

2612
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>but you see several in a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2613
02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:55.080
<v Speaker 2>That are pretty earth shattering in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their complexity and involvement.</v>

2614
02:15:55.131 --> 02:15:58.130
<v Speaker 2>We've seen the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen social media,</v>

2615
02:15:58.131 --> 02:16:00.530
<v Speaker 2>we've seen the miniaturization of</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>

2616
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to see self driving cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and digital currencies and all of these</v>

2617
02:16:06.531 --> 02:16:09.410
<v Speaker 2>other things in a single lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you've seen two or three of these,</v>

2618
02:16:09.411 --> 02:16:14.411
<v Speaker 2>you start capturing the pattern and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern is when it starts,</v>

2619
02:16:15.921 --> 02:16:18.590
<v Speaker 2>everybody ignores it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes fun of it.</v>

2620
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Can't possibly see how change would</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2621
02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2622
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:27.140
<v Speaker 2>and this happened with the automobile</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened with electricity.</v>

2623
02:16:27.141 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 2>It happens with credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time credit cards</v>

2624
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:32.230
<v Speaker 3>were introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thought they were going to work</v>

2625
02:16:32.410 --> 02:16:35.500
<v Speaker 3>is a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid experiments nobody wanted to take</v>

2626
02:16:35.501 --> 02:16:38.320
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This happens with every type of</v>

2627
02:16:38.321 --> 02:16:40.450
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculed at first,</v>

2628
02:16:40.510 --> 02:16:44.830
<v Speaker 3>and then gradually it matures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets less cumbersome to use.</v>

2629
02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:48.420
<v Speaker 3>And if it has some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some fundamental properties,</v>

2630
02:16:48.421 --> 02:16:52.060
<v Speaker 3>some utility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's useful for that's</v>

<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's new,</v>

2632
02:16:53.081 --> 02:16:55.480
<v Speaker 3>that you can do things with it you</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't do before,</v>

2633
02:16:56.050 --> 02:17:00.760
<v Speaker 3>then at some point it hits an inflection</v>
<v Speaker 3>point and it becomes mainstream very,</v>

2634
02:17:00.761 --> 02:17:05.080
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then everybody is both surprised and</v>

2635
02:17:05.081 --> 02:17:06.640
<v Speaker 3>at the same time claims ownership and</v>
