9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

10
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:25.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is over.</v>

11
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole game is up tomorrow.</v>

12
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 2>You could have had anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

13
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 2>you're a pretty powerful guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Enjoy your company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

15
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

16
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 2>But you could think of all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers you could had the thinkers,</v>

17
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much work.</v>

18
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went with me for the last show,</v>

19
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to bring it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already,</v>

20
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I have notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I busted out the notepad.</v>

21
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I believe that end of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

22
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>So you're the preview to the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

23
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like you're going to offer</v>
<v Speaker 2>some pr.</v>

24
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.401
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully.</v>

25
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>What together we're going to offer some</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and a,</v>

26
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get a look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

27
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I already pounded two of these bad boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I am ready to this fucking thing of</v>

28
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 2>270 milligrams of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 2>it sways in a small cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I thought it was all right.</v>

30
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it seems small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it was that much acid and think</v>

31
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 2>about what we're doing to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to think about it that</v>

32
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.051
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I did acid once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one time.</v>

34
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I did it once last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That did.</v>

35
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 2>He really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

36
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it three times.</v>

37
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I only did it this year for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

38
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>but I've done it three times this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

39
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 2>And you feel like all the doors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hinges of the brain,</v>

40
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>there's still going because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think we're any good at all before.</v>

41
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

42
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like cock for my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I shrew many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

44
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>over the years I did acid once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not like it at all.</v>

45
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I closed my eyes and he's</v>

46
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>like three dimensional triangle is</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying at me.</v>

47
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Like could not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 2>when you just can't stop your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt that there was no end to it.</v>

49
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Shrooms until he's like very natural and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice and pleasant.</v>

50
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concern is the potency of,</v>

51
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 2>of acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't heard it described by Terence</v>

52
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna as like molecularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at it in scale,</v>

53
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.690
<v Speaker 2>it's something the size of an ant that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can break down the empire state building</v>

54
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 2>in 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bit much for me at this point.</v>

55
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.091
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

56
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I turned 40 this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to break down the empire</v>

57
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>state building or any other building at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point.</v>

58
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Now it's really about keeping the mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>faculties I have adding in a little more</v>

59
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 2>occasionally going from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to function right?</v>

61
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing comedy,</v>

62
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at some point the expansion of the</v>

63
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 2>mind is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still gotta be on earth.</v>

64
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you got to do the show,</v>

65
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you definitely have to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be there.</v>

66
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.963
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

67
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Duncan and I did a show on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did our last podcast with full</v>

68
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 2>disclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were on acid cheeses.</v>

69
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in a room sober with these</v>

70
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 2>beans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

71
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>it's less is expected of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

72
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 2>you're expected to be rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But being a standup comedian slash cage</v>

73
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:58.130
<v Speaker 2>fighting commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of wiggle room.</v>

74
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.883
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

76
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>you could say some pretty stupid shit.</v>

77
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.360
<v Speaker 2>People go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

78
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably got hit in the head.</v>

79
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

80
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

81
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.900
<v Speaker 2>obviously we're going to do election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

82
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple updates so I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>been here in about a year,</v>

83
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>a little more than a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of things I want to tell you</v>

84
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>first off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got a house last week not too far</v>

85
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.140
<v Speaker 2>from here building a home studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very excited.</v>

86
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might,</v>

87
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 2>my fans are funding it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing.</v>

88
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ton of stuff has happened since last,</v>

89
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.530
<v Speaker 2>but I told you last time that I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that I've hit a certain level of</v>

90
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.931
<v Speaker 2>success when I'm not sitting on an ikea</v>
<v Speaker 2>couch and did not have ikea stuff around</v>

91
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 2>me everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

92
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I did bring all the Ikea stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I made one purchase for the new</v>

93
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one purchase.</v>

94
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 2>We've got a real couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a real couch.</v>

95
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a real couch.</v>

96
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking people delivered it and I</v>

97
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was act.</v>

98
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know that that was a thing</v>

99
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 2>that they come put together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that Kia stuff is bullshit.</v>

100
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 2>If you just charge 10 bucks more and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it together,</v>

101
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody would probably cost more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 bucks.</v>

102
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the whole thing?</v>

103
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 2>It costs more than 10 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If for them to put it together for you,</v>

104
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>did they put it together for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will they do that?</v>

105
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 2>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be more than 10 bucks.</v>

106
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't even mind putting it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just time for me not to have to</v>

107
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.980
<v Speaker 2>put together furniture desks together</v>
<v Speaker 2>once and it's,</v>

108
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

109
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I forgot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it had an estimate of how much time</v>

110
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>it took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it took me four fucking hours.</v>

111
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.500
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

112
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this an acid situation?</v>

113
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 2>That would be something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

114
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Ikea assembly on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you do it better.</v>

115
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 2>You know like talk Willis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who pitched a no hitter,</v>

116
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 2>he was fucked up all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was doing acid and then you got the</v>

117
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 2>call and didn't know he's supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play that day.</v>

118
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

119
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 2>they want me to play today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like got his shit together for good.</v>

120
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Just pitching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine getting your shit together.</v>

121
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that in and of itself.</v>

122
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on the guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your biological makeup,</v>

123
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 2>how it hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 2>cause I know a lot of friends who just</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't smoke pot.</v>

125
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't work with them.</v>

126
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 2>And with me it works great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my favorite.</v>

127
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you like indicators?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sativa or hybrid?</v>

128
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm prefer sativa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if someone's passed around the end</v>

129
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 2>to good joint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say no.</v>

130
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my comic friends like Sativa,</v>

131
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I like Endeca because for me at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

132
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and I guess this goes back to the doors</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the main thing,</v>

133
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>like I don't want to think anymore if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm smoking,</v>

134
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't smoke pot to think or to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

135
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I smoke pot because it's 1130 at night</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to take one puff and watch</v>

136
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Seinfeld that I've seen 3000 times</v>
<v Speaker 2>already or simpsons that I've seen three</v>

137
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

138
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't smoke to like,</v>

139
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 2>like all my concrete smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

140
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.863
<v Speaker 2>Or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

141
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a decompressing.</v>

142
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agent purely.</v>

143
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.153
<v Speaker 2>Purely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 2>people get real wary when you started</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about pot or acid or even</v>

146
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 2>alcohol because there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone knows that it's kind of</v>

147
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 2>fucked her life up doing that.</v>

148
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 2>But 35,000 people died driving every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

149
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't stop us from driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

150
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously if you're doing acid,</v>

151
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>most likely you're not going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

152
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's the responsibility of driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a window like a Helen Hunt did</v>

153
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that inform word,</v>

154
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 2>that kid's thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed it at my high school.</v>

155
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>They showed it in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

156
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.150
<v Speaker 2>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was helen,</v>

157
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.040
<v Speaker 2>how you know which one I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

158
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>What they should know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That education will video where they</v>

159
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 2>showed these high school kids and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helen Hunt.</v>

160
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>It was like a 15 year old and she's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid and she jumped out a window and</v>

161
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 2>breaks the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just kills herself at school.</v>

162
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Fucking old Bill Hicks bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that Bill Hicks,</v>

163
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 2>bit young man on acid thought he could</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly,</v>

164
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>jumps off the building.</v>

165
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 2>What a tragedy goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a Dick.</v>

166
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 2>He thought he could fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he tried taking off from the</v>

167
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 2>ground first and as we lost a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

168
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 2>we need a hex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't we need a hicks?</v>

169
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Every day I wake up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

170
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I wish we had is still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we still,</v>

171
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's plenty of good comics</v>

172
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:51.570
<v Speaker 2>out there and there's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's such a plane,</v>

173
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 2>this stuff to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to see Helen Hunt to talk</v>

174
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

175
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 2>you know how many times that it's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>said before,</v>

176
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.903
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>

177
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the best Paul Riser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not his business card.</v>

178
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 2>I think he wakes up in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

179
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.010
<v Speaker 2>what the hell was I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acid?</v>

180
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People dying.</v>

181
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we moved on all the good comics.</v>

182
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 2>There was something there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

183
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 2>well one that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine what George Carlin would be</v>

184
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 2>going through if he lived right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politically correct age we live in.</v>

185
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 2>If you took any of his old stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be being attacked by all sides.</v>

186
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>But dare I say he'd be hacked more by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left these days for the shit that he</v>

187
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 2>would be talking and saying about women</v>
<v Speaker 2>or about minorities or anything.</v>

188
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

189
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 2>it's such a shame the way things have</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned.</v>

190
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:36.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

191
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 2>he had some mean stuff that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

192
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I remember this one bit that he had that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even at the time I was like,</v>

193
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like anorexia and he's like,</v>

194
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.770
<v Speaker 2>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich doesn't want Tucker,</v>

195
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 2>but we need that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>

196
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

197
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.670
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't saying this specific girl who</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have anorexia that you're going to a</v>

198
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 2>lot or died from anorexia and you heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you'd be like,</v>

199
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 2>whoa man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

200
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would upset you at that moment.</v>

201
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 2>And then you know what life goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know George Carlin,</v>

202
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.610
<v Speaker 2>there was one issue with Carlin and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one issue was that he had a plan to do a</v>

203
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:17.111
<v Speaker 2>whole new hour every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he would put together this hour</v>

204
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't work out at comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

205
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.280
<v Speaker 2>He would just sort of write it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>go and perform it and you know,</v>

206
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.320
<v Speaker 2>do little tweaks here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doing that one hour every year,</v>

207
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have enough time to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't sit around and go,</v>

208
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if this is a good bit,</v>

209
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:36.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

210
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 2>am I committed to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I believe in it.</v>

211
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Like if I explored all the possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the ways that this is going to</v>

212
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 2>be interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this the most effective way to convey</v>

213
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.500
<v Speaker 2>that idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was also so,</v>

214
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 2>so loved and so awesome that he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to shock the shit out of people.</v>

215
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 2>That was half of it was like he tired of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

216
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Talk about Anorexia and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if he was alive today and you were</v>

217
00:08:58.831 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>talking to him about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

218
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 2>he would change his opinion on that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

219
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if we went back in the however</v>

220
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.590
<v Speaker 2>many years you've been doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>there things that you've said there</v>

221
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 2>probably that's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said last week.</v>

222
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

223
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>but we need that idea of people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying shit and letting it upset people</v>

224
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 2>and other people are going to laugh at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

225
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>We so desperately need it now because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has led the inability to do that these</v>

226
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 2>days has led to everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in our country right now.</v>

227
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 2>What related to politics and media and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

228
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a blow back,</v>

229
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go too far left though,</v>

230
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 2>the alt right emerges and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 2>more looney we get in terms of like</v>

231
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 2>gender pronouns and that there's 58 now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 58 gender pronouns.</v>

232
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to,</v>

233
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 2>you know this morning I think the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize 31 in New York that you could</v>

234
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:54.700
<v Speaker 2>be sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$250,000 for it.</v>

235
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Or you find if you pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking fiasco.</v>

236
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one going to look back at this and</v>

237
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>laugh as long as you're not one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who gets fined $250,000 and I</v>

238
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>don't think anybody's ever been hit with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that yet.</v>

239
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more more like horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

240
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 2>But it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even about the fine as much as</v>

241
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>what it does to us as people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it puts the idea in your mind,</v>

242
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was walking down the street and I</v>

243
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 2>saw a guy and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

244
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 2>how you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized it was a woman,</v>

245
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I would kind of feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's life.</v>

246
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 2>That's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to through words and</v>

247
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>trickery.</v>

248
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And now legal means we're trying to dumb</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone down to the point that we can't</v>

249
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 2>even think for ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at somebody and you think</v>

250
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 2>they're a man and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

251
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 2>that's not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

252
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.541
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

253
00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and not every person that transitions</v>
<v Speaker 2>transitions perfectly and someone might</v>

254
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 2>be in the middle of it or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 2>or there might just be a guy who looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

256
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.220
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that look like women and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's women that look like guys.</v>

257
00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>You know what's ironic about this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really a trans issue.</v>

258
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to trans people.</v>

259
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Most women who transition to men want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be called men.</v>

260
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 2>And most men who transition to women</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be called women.</v>

261
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Like they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They assumed gender pronouns.</v>

262
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the guy who becomes a woman wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use he or once you,</v>

263
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>she or her.</v>

264
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not them.</v>

265
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just nonsense is what it is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nonsense that comes out of</v>

266
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird Marxism thing that's</v>

267
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this very strange leftist bullying</v>

268
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>because it's so deranged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

269
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I know you've had my on here and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>become like this cultural thing.</v>

270
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's sort of become something beyond</v>

271
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 2>himself at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the streisand effect that keeps</v>

272
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:41.280
<v Speaker 2>silencing him and when you silence the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who,</v>

273
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they silenced him for was so</v>

274
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>unwarranted because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you remove someone on twitter for</v>

275
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:52.110
<v Speaker 2>just a harmless joke that's very similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the jokes that Leslie Jones makes</v>

276
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 2>about her own self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

277
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>she's got a</v>

278
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.310
<v Speaker 3>God damn commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

279
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 3>She pulls up a Geico commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

280
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

281
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 3>what does that commercial was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She pulls up to someone.</v>

282
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

283
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 3>but she pulls up to a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

284
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 3>do you want my number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys who get the fuck out of here?</v>

285
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like an obvious joke about her</v>
<v Speaker 3>being unattractive.</v>

286
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 3>She's perpetrating that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what it is.</v>

287
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:11.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's,</v>

288
00:12:11.911 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 3>say if you do that same joke with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

289
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a girl for Sofia Vergara or</v>

290
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The joke doesn't work.</v>

291
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.150
<v Speaker 3>It's just hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the guy would be like,</v>

292
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 3>but when Leslie Jones does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why that joke works is</v>

293
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 3>because they're implying that she's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive.</v>

294
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 3>So all Milo said is something about her</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a man or looking like a man or</v>

295
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

296
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 3>And that was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

297
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 3>what's particularly interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to him is that they</v>

298
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:36.870
<v Speaker 3>claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when,</v>

299
00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 3>when twitter finally said a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about it,</v>

300
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 3>that it was because if targeted</v>
<v Speaker 3>harassment that Milo had unleashed his</v>

301
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 3>followers on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now first off,</v>

302
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't control all your followers.</v>

303
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:49.020
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you got into a fight with somebody,</v>

304
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan got into a fight with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>on twitter,</v>

305
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't control what your followers</v>

306
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's number one.</v>

307
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

308
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 3>she had done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are instances,</v>

309
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 3>people had screen captured things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had gotten into fights with trollie</v>

310
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 3>type people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not public people and said,</v>

311
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:05.644
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them.</v>

312
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 3>So she had actually instigated mobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's okay for all the politically</v>

313
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 3>correct reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay when she does it well not only</v>

314
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 3>she had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd done that,</v>

315
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 3>she had said things about white people</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically like white people,</v>

316
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was specifically mocking white</v>

317
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 3>people are saying things about white</v>
<v Speaker 3>people where it's like you can't do that</v>

318
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:24.574
<v Speaker 3>the other way.</v>

319
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

320
00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 3>there's this also this very bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that people keep saying is that</v>

321
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.150
<v Speaker 3>black people can't be racist against</v>
<v Speaker 3>white people because racism only works</v>

322
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 3>when someone's in a position of power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess fucking what?</v>

323
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 3>If you have millions of followers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're super famous and you say things</v>

324
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:42.371
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

325
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 3>any white person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a position of power.</v>

326
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Not only does she have a position of</v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

327
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 3>but she think how much by doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by that fight happening,</v>

328
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 3>she got more powerful her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her star rose.</v>

329
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by damaging free speech,</v>

330
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 3>whether you like my lower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not she,</v>

331
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 3>she then elevated her own status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

332
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I've never interacted with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never even seen ghostbusters.</v>

333
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even watch this.</v>

334
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 3>And now I don't even know what she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really done or anything better.</v>

335
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 3>But when the whole thing was going down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to tweet at her to say,</v>

336
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:09.800
<v Speaker 3>come on my show.</v>

337
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

338
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I like Milo buttom all that free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to have you on.</v>

339
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.300
<v Speaker 3>She has me blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She blowouts.</v>

340
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a mass block thing.</v>

341
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you block people associated with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milo or something.</v>

342
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.070
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing.</v>

343
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing against her in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking about this specific</v>

344
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:26.770
<v Speaker 3>thing and I was going to invite her on</v>
<v Speaker 3>my show and it's like,</v>

345
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're a nice guy.</v>

346
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 3>That's so cowardly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so foolish.</v>

347
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I like Leslie.</v>

348
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I think she's funny as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's hilarious.</v>

349
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.450
<v Speaker 3>I even enjoyed her and ghostbusters</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

350
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.790
<v Speaker 3>although Milo is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of that movie,</v>

351
00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:38.840
<v Speaker 3>it was a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

352
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I thought the movie started out really</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

353
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 3>but what he was saying was that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

354
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 3>it was a ridiculous feminist version of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ghostbusters where all the men are</v>

355
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 3>complete buffoons and failures and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women saved the day.</v>

356
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 3>And it just wasn't a good movie.</v>

357
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't well designed and it was sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a kind of a slap in the face to men.</v>

358
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 2>And that was his whole commentary on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very eloquently written.</v>

359
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little bit bitchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's his whole thing.</v>

360
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

361
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>it certainly wasn't targeted harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a review of art will look,</v>

362
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 2>the point is that even if he had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassing her and said,</v>

363
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get her first off,</v>

364
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 2>but if he did do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand them saying we don't</v>

365
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 2>want our platform use for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

366
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's up to their terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>

367
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:22.250
<v Speaker 2>so there's obviously a difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

368
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the First Amendment,</v>

369
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.790
<v Speaker 2>which is the government stopping you</v>
<v Speaker 2>from speaking of what a private company</v>

370
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ironically though all these people on</v>

371
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 2>the left that we're thrilled or had no</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with Milo being banned,</v>

372
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 2>they're the same people that want it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>force that Baker in Indiana to bake the</v>

373
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 2>cake for the gay wedding.</v>

374
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 2>So they're okay with private companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things when it's the things that</v>

375
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.680
<v Speaker 2>they want them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get rid of,</v>

376
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conservative,</v>

377
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 2>right when they want it to force that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bay.</v>

378
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>

379
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't force that Baker to do it.</v>

380
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.041
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

381
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 2>what's fucked up about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I want the government?</v>

382
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Why would I want the government to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do something with your</v>

383
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 2>private business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

384
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to another fucking baker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

385
00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:57.460
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

386
00:15:57.461 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't an organic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd set that up.</v>

387
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 2>They went specifically and targeted</v>
<v Speaker 2>bakers to try to make a case for this.</v>

388
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you went to a Christian Baker</v>

389
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and finally found one who said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the one they went after.</v>

390
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

391
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that guy and not</v>

392
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 2>being able to make that cake.</v>

393
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you shouldn't go and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>business at that guy's place.</v>

394
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's the kind of person he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they're doing is,</v>

395
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I like trying to target that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But would you for,</v>

396
00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:26.410
<v Speaker 2>would you want the government forced him</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do well?</v>

397
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the market should dictate</v>

398
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.990
<v Speaker 2>whether or not someone does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

399
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I think alerting people is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having the government dictate to</v>

400
00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:37.100
<v Speaker 2>these people have to make that case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of,</v>

401
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>

402
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happened to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

403
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:46.391
<v Speaker 2>The left has gone from liberalism using</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic and thinking and uh,</v>

404
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 2>an information basically to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions to inform your decisions.</v>

405
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.370
<v Speaker 2>And usually liberals err on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>

406
00:16:53.371 --> 00:16:56.180
<v Speaker 2>So in this case they're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they're protecting the gaze</v>

407
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

408
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Like we want days to get cakes where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else gets cake.</v>

409
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to help the gays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they've done is all they're</v>

410
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 2>doing is expanding state power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're extending,</v>

411
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 2>expanding control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let the market decide.</v>

412
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Sure you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to use your free speech,</v>

413
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:11.740
<v Speaker 2>protest outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet about it.</v>

414
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't go there.</v>

415
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>There's a baker to two blocks over goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're gay,</v>

416
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your,</v>

417
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 2>use your money wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Support people that support your</v>

418
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

419
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:22.100
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a thing for everything.</v>

420
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:23.930
<v Speaker 2>That's for rude people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for,</v>

421
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:25.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for assholes,</v>

422
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>for people who are Shitty to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people who are,</v>

423
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just for people who will rip you</v>

424
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:31.341
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

425
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of along the same lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let the market decide,</v>

426
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 2>let the market decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

427
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like Joe Show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like Reuben's show.</v>

428
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.660
<v Speaker 2>You don't watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't watch.</v>

429
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Tell people that you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's quite all right,</v>

430
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:45.170
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't try to shut us down.</v>

431
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't try to go to youtube and strike us</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever other thing there is.</v>

432
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>But that's what the left</v>

433
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 3>is doing this now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I talk about the left all</v>

434
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 3>the time because I have liberal and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching my guys band speakers,</v>

435
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching my guys d platform people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching,</v>

436
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 3>my guys tried to close restaurants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're now you're moralizing</v>

437
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 3>the same way you've mocked the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian,</v>

438
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For All these years.</v>

439
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

440
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.950
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets to a point where you,</v>

441
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 3>you wonder if it's to swing back the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other way.</v>

442
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll find out tomorrow.</v>

443
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

444
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 3>And that creates tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying for a while that I</v>

445
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 3>think Caitlyn Jenner created Donald</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>

446
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it created this thing.</v>

447
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a thing,</v>

448
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 3>there was a tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me it was when they gave her</v>

449
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 3>woman of the year and Glamour magazine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then Espn has gave her ass a athlete</v>

450
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 3>of the year.</v>

451
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.440
<v Speaker 3>And when we're that ridiculous thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they did where they circled or</v>

452
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:40.980
<v Speaker 3>House with the helicopter and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiding behind the curtains and there was</v>

453
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 3>all mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

454
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.420
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck are you selling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

455
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.990
<v Speaker 3>And for people at home that are like in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indiana and they're drinking beer and</v>

456
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:51.510
<v Speaker 3>they like football and they went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch the sps to see,</v>

457
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who won best quarterback in the</v>

458
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 3>year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're seeing that kind of shit.</v>

459
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is as we need a make</v>

460
00:18:58.111 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 3>America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

461
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I never linked it that specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you're totally right.</v>

462
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Even right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I've been watching,</v>

463
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nba season just started and I love</v>

464
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I turn on TNT now it's</v>

465
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Barkley and Kenny Smith and Shaq and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ernie Johnson talking about race.</v>

466
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 3>They're not talking about basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about race.</v>

467
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.270
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about policing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all important issues to talk</v>

468
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:21.960
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people go to sports for the release,</v>

469
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 3>they go to sports because they care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that leads and what's happening on</v>

470
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 3>the field and in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the boxing match or whatever it is.</v>

471
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 3>And now everything is becoming</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicized.</v>

472
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 3>So espn is giving their athlete of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>year to Caitlyn Jenner.</v>

473
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 3>It makes no freaking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was the NFL ratings down.</v>

474
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because people are talking about</v>

475
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Kaepernick and politics instead of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports.</v>

476
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Does that make the ratings go down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really is the ratings down.</v>

477
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 3>The ratings are hugely down in the NFL</v>
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>

478
00:19:45.881 --> 00:19:48.450
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people are linking that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know it empirically,</v>

479
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people in this country</v>

480
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 3>just have zero tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

481
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like separation of church</v>
<v Speaker 3>and state.</v>

482
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.900
<v Speaker 3>They would like their sports to just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports and about sports.</v>

483
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

484
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:00.690
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of appreciate that in a certain</v>

485
00:20:00.691 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 3>way because it's like if you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching a comedy show and all of a</v>

486
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:06.020
<v Speaker 3>sudden during that comedy show they</v>
<v Speaker 3>started deeply discussing religion,</v>

487
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.650
<v Speaker 3>like really like discussing deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>intricacies of different faith based</v>

488
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 3>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

489
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck am I want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not comedy.</v>

490
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do is funny.</v>

491
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you heard that thing and now</v>

492
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something else right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a different thing but</v>

493
00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing,</v>

494
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.900
<v Speaker 3>you're doing race relations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing?</v>

495
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 3>But I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>

496
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.690
<v Speaker 3>they look at it as a platform for our</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and that's what Kaepernick did.</v>

497
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.351
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

498
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I have this platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in some ways I think what he did</v>

499
00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 3>kind of worked because a lot of kids in</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school now are doing that.</v>

500
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>They're taking knees and the national,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

501
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:43.010
<v Speaker 3>when they do the national anthem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

502
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.270
<v Speaker 3>it's strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also like the black,</v>

503
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people have the black fist at</v>

504
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those dudes that did that and the</v>

505
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.180
<v Speaker 2>1960,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

506
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 71,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 71,</v>

507
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that was.</v>

508
00:20:55.151 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that got people talk and this gets</v>

509
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 2>people talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe sometimes you need to kind of</v>

510
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:05.431
<v Speaker 2>inject some sort of something to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about during sporting events.</v>

511
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

512
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling them not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I would knit cabernet and</v>

513
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 2>wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

514
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Barkley and all they want it,</v>

515
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 2>if they're tnt bosses are okay with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>may go,</v>

516
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:15.191
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of talking about how many points</v>

518
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 2>to ran head then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so be it.</v>

519
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just saying what I think most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want from sports is an escape.</v>

520
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.480
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you for sure in the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>or three weeks at the NBA season,</v>

521
00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 2>it's been gone.</v>

522
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Every time I flipped by TNT and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

523
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I change it where I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love those guys.</v>

524
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that show in many ways is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible social experiment,</v>

525
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:38.610
<v Speaker 2>not just as a sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the show is.</v>

526
00:21:38.611 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the after show on TNT where they'll</v>

527
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 2>watch Barkley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's Barkley who's obviously</v>

528
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:46.810
<v Speaker 2>completely outspoken and an incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Kenny Smith who also is in shack,</v>

529
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.001
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

530
00:21:48.001 --> 00:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>and Ernie Johnson's the token white guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the white guys,</v>

531
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.040
<v Speaker 2>but they're all really great and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their rhythm with each other for four</v>

532
00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:00.100
<v Speaker 2>guys to sit there and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing it for probably 15</v>

533
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shacks newer to it.</v>

534
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

535
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I go to espn or tnt for sports and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hear,</v>

536
00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:09.780
<v Speaker 2>and there's so many to talk about in</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

537
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 2>It's all these players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these plays,</v>

538
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:14.440
<v Speaker 2>all these games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much is riding on each event.</v>

539
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not a grudging them any of the</v>

540
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 2>legitimate things that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

541
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Of course they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the athletes can do whatever they want</v>

542
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>to express themselves in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once that starts becoming more of</v>

543
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the sports,</v>

544
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 2>that's why people start tuning out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well again,</v>

545
00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:31.870
<v Speaker 2>the market's decided right and if their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ratings go down because of this,</v>

546
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:34.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe someone in the head office</v>
<v Speaker 2>will go,</v>

547
00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

548
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.033
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

549
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 2>and that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's absolutely how it should</v>

550
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:39.641
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

551
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:42.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating time and I think this</v>

552
00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 2>is a side effect of everyone having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

553
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Cause we all have voices now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

554
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:52.000
<v Speaker 2>This is the new world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new world we live in is anyone can</v>

555
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 2>broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone can get on periscope and just</v>

556
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 2>start talking.</v>

557
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Anybody don't tell everybody that anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

558
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can get on twitter and just make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a post about something.</v>

559
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been telling my people,</v>

560
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one that can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember that woman?</v>

561
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 2>What was her name again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman who wrote the post about aids</v>

562
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Africa.</v>

563
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Hope I don't get aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lol.</v>

564
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm white.</v>

565
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just a nobody pr person.</v>

566
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew who she was before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember her name.</v>

567
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Justine Sacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

568
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>

569
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

570
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.570
<v Speaker 2>that sort of event it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's the beginning.</v>

571
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 2>It's the first pop of the colonel when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start making popcorn and you hear</v>

572
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:30.990
<v Speaker 2>that first pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

573
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

574
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>pop up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah,</v>

575
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.200
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're culturally about to fucking Jiffy</v>

576
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 2>pop the fuck out of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's happening.</v>

577
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>You're going nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

578
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember when that sacco thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and so basically she said that</v>

579
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 2>she said that joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she gets on a plane,</v>

580
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>she disappears for what,</v>

581
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 4>eight 10 hours or something and then she</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets up late.</v>

582
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 4>Her life is destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has to leave her job,</v>

583
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.321
<v Speaker 4>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

584
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 4>She's publicly humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember and look,</v>

585
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:56.630
<v Speaker 4>I tweet all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love twitter and I love the way you</v>

586
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 4>can communicate through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I remember I didn't tweet anything</v>

587
00:23:59.301 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 4>about it intentionally cause I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

588
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 4>it's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

589
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:02.541
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

590
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

591
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Let me get this straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A woman who I've never heard of before</v>

592
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 4>who's not a public person per se,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeted a bad joke,</v>

593
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 4>basically really tasteless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid thought.</v>

594
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Her life is going to be the short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would I add to that?</v>

595
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.200
<v Speaker 4>So I really tried to make a conscious</v>
<v Speaker 4>decision to just be like,</v>

596
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I do that now and again,</v>

597
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 4>we're certain news things where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

598
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 4>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to sit out because we this</v>

599
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 4>gang mentality like no one had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd know you didn't know who that was</v>

600
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew who this woman was before.</v>

601
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 4>But so one random person said something</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I didn't like,</v>

602
00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:35.480
<v Speaker 4>we must destroy her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're right,</v>

603
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.880
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first pop and now they're,</v>

604
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 4>these pops are happening all over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

605
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is what I,</v>

606
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:45.320
<v Speaker 4>why I think what Peter Teal did with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hogan and Gawker is fucking phenomenal.</v>

607
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.890
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nominal.</v>

608
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

609
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.270
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there,</v>

610
00:24:48.271 --> 00:24:51.850
<v Speaker 5>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some violent and aggressive</v>

611
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:55.990
<v Speaker 5>invasion of privacy that's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 5>companies that are trying to make a lot</v>

612
00:24:55.991 --> 00:24:58.480
<v Speaker 5>of money by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the things that a lot</v>

613
00:24:58.481 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 5>of people thought about Gawker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

614
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 5>I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did read an incredible piece on Gawker</v>

615
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.290
<v Speaker 5>from May,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate to say this about donald trump's</v>

616
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:09.200
<v Speaker 5>hair or they are investigating donald</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump's hair is a very expensive,</v>

617
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.560
<v Speaker 4>I read it and they had like a diagram of</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing how beers around and like that</v>

618
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:16.140
<v Speaker 4>there's an office in trump tower</v>

619
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.560
<v Speaker 5>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one floor below his and the</v>

620
00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:23.080
<v Speaker 5>office doesn't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have a website anymore.</v>

621
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.590
<v Speaker 5>And they've been doing this procedure</v>
<v Speaker 5>for like a long time.</v>

622
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like they essentially,</v>

623
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:33.190
<v Speaker 5>they take a hair and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they find whatever hairs you have and</v>

624
00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:38.191
<v Speaker 5>they sort of tie this hair onto your</v>
<v Speaker 5>hair one hair at a time and it's like</v>

625
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:42.670
<v Speaker 5>some crazy eight hour procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the speculation is that the entire</v>

626
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 5>business revolves around maintaining his</v>
<v Speaker 5>hair in that manner.</v>

627
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:48.340
<v Speaker 5>Now as someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

628
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.220
<v Speaker 5>is bald,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his balls going to try to do thing</v>

629
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.580
<v Speaker 5>violently challenge hair transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to the</v>

630
00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:01.170
<v Speaker 5>big smile scar in the back of my head</v>
<v Speaker 5>from you chop out a piece of the back of</v>

631
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:02.920
<v Speaker 5>your head and they tried to put it up</v>
<v Speaker 5>front.</v>

632
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way I described it as like they take</v>

633
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.410
<v Speaker 5>some people that are really healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they move into a neighborhood where</v>

634
00:26:08.411 --> 00:26:09.250
<v Speaker 5>everyone's dying.</v>

635
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.490
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

636
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

637
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:14.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I did it,</v>

638
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 5>I was in my late twenties and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just on television and I was</v>

639
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:20.440
<v Speaker 5>panicking because my hair was falling</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

640
00:26:20.441 --> 00:26:21.240
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

641
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my career is just getting started and</v>

642
00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:28.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to lose it all because I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking very probably correctly that a</v>

643
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:30.910
<v Speaker 5>lot of my success is predicated on my</v>
<v Speaker 5>appearance.</v>

644
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.550
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if this goes like if I go bald,</v>

645
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:35.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want had shaved heads back then in</v>

646
00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:36.790
<v Speaker 5>the nineties either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they did,</v>

647
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:40.090
<v Speaker 5>it was very rare and a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I went through all this,</v>

648
00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 5>but it helped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It definitely gave me like thicker hair,</v>

649
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.733
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

650
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 2>it was too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was too much work and eventually I</v>

651
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 2>realized like it's so pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I shaved my head it was</v>

652
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 2>like the most freeing feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say I like it better like this.</v>

653
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had hair right now at fucking shave</v>

654
00:26:57.601 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

655
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm holding ground and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I looked wonderful,</v>

656
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go hard on your hair,</v>

657
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 2>but I used to have hair over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's what happens is as</v>

658
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 2>you age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know for sure there were times in</v>

659
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 2>my life when I was very stressed and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not kidding you.</v>

660
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you feel it when you were,</v>

661
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 2>when you were losing hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you feel it at times coming out?</v>

662
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a,</v>

663
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 2>not literally like each individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

664
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:23.930
<v Speaker 2>but almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could feel my tension there basically.</v>

665
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>And as I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just psychological.</v>

666
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

667
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your hair is completely connected</v>

668
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:30.650
<v Speaker 2>to your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're one of them.</v>

669
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.590
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't smoke pot anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's what I would think about.</v>

670
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I smoked pot and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

671
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 2>what's going on up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

672
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.950
<v Speaker 2>railing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

673
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

674
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 2>that's the rub on the pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

675
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 2>But it's fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

676
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:41.090
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just comes to this.</v>

677
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.330
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like the Sativa Endeca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like pop for that reason though to go</v>

678
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.600
<v Speaker 2>to fucking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

679
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like that old joke that Kennison</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to have about a,</v>

680
00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:53.040
<v Speaker 2>they say every man's got a homosexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy.</v>

681
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

682
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting around the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on through my fantasies.</v>

683
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Because if there's one on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know.</v>

684
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you find yours?</v>

685
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sorry for your people.</v>

686
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 2>So when you see someone that is shaved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels good about it,</v>

687
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:12.770
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a burning off all the time of</v>

688
00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:13.820
<v Speaker 2>the dudes are struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

689
00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:17.580
<v Speaker 2>just shave your fucking head so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't trump seem doubly ridiculous to</v>

690
00:28:17.581 --> 00:28:18.540
<v Speaker 2>you in a certain way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

691
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 2>he's more than doubly ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's ridiculous.</v>

692
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 2>In a million different wines just on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair front.</v>

693
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's cliche so we don't have to</v>

694
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:26.500
<v Speaker 2>spend too much time talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't that like if someone who</v>

695
00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:27.960
<v Speaker 2>shaved your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel good about it,</v>

696
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 2>that he does this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whatever the fuck he did.</v>

697
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 2>He always says it's my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my hair.</v>

698
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Which is sort of a cop cause yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably doing something by</v>

699
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

700
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>But doesn't it seem doubly ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to someone like you like knowing</v>

701
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 2>that you shaved and you feel good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>life goes on and then I get it from a</v>

702
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 2>psychological standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it also is a person who likes to</v>

703
00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 2>have control of their life.</v>

704
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

705
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 2>you feel like that's one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really freaks people out about their</v>

706
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like features and an appearance</v>

707
00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:57.990
<v Speaker 2>is very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

708
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know this woman who recently got</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nose job and uh,</v>

709
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.700
<v Speaker 2>she's beautiful and she decided that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like her nose and she got like a</v>

710
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:07.230
<v Speaker 2>little bit trimmed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy,</v>

711
00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

712
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.210
<v Speaker 2>But there's a weird thing where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that if my nose was one eighth of</v>

713
00:29:12.211 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 2>a millimeter smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would feel better about myself.</v>

714
00:29:15.601 --> 00:29:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I would feel better about my appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've met people that have big noses.</v>

715
00:29:20.581 --> 00:29:21.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't look any better.</v>

716
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 2>She looked great before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looks great now.</v>

717
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.930
<v Speaker 2>It's just a weird thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fixate.</v>

718
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 2>But what I was going to get at is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really strange,</v>

719
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.260
<v Speaker 2>like what we decide looks good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

720
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And that it's cultural and a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you go to something like,</v>

721
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.990
<v Speaker 2>how bout those think it's Sir Siri women</v>
<v Speaker 2>who decide,</v>

722
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 2>put those giant plates</v>

723
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.370
<v Speaker 5>in their lips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

724
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 5>And the bigger the plate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more cattle they're worth when they</v>

725
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 5>get married.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like fucking really bizarre</v>

726
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 5>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's an example of how human beings</v>

727
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 5>when isolated for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I mean,</v>

728
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 5>there's scar scarf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vacation rituals that many cultures go</v>

729
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 5>through with a cut pieces out of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin to appear to look like crocodiles.</v>

730
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 5>And you're seeing that where they do</v>
<v Speaker 5>their backs then do it.</v>

731
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

732
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:11.881
<v Speaker 5>They cut these chunks out of their back</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they develop these keloid scars</v>

733
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 5>that pop up and they see if you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>find that Janet men with crocodiles</v>

734
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 5>scarring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

735
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 5>there's so many different scarf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vacation rituals,</v>

736
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 5>and look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm covered in tattoos.</v>

737
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 5>There's like weird things that people do</v>
<v Speaker 5>to their body and weird appearances that</v>

738
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 5>people choose to enjoy or not enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it just gets,</v>

739
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 5>it gets very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

740
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is hair?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is that guy's back?</v>

741
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.421
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

742
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:38.960
<v Speaker 5>I have seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

743
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they just,</v>

744
00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 5>they cover their entire back with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it makes it look like,</v>

745
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.970
<v Speaker 5>like a crocodile skin.</v>

746
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.180
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

747
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.133
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

748
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.600
<v Speaker 4>joy bay heart used to say a phrase on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the view,</v>

749
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 4>dare I quote the view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but joy bay,</v>

750
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.560
<v Speaker 4>how are you saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always thought it was great.</v>

751
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:55.490
<v Speaker 4>It was really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She usually,</v>

752
00:30:55.491 --> 00:30:59.330
<v Speaker 4>they just say it's an inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everything really is just an inside</v>

753
00:30:59.331 --> 00:31:00.650
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're walking around,</v>

754
00:31:00.651 --> 00:31:03.110
<v Speaker 4>your friends walking around and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks that this little,</v>

755
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.870
<v Speaker 4>you're a beautiful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she thinks this little millimeters</v>

756
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:09.350
<v Speaker 4>so it bothers her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For some reason it's an inside job.</v>

757
00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Now she may still have that same</v>
<v Speaker 4>insecurity after,</v>

758
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 4>or maybe she exercised it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

759
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe it actually did do what it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to do.</v>

760
00:31:15.861 --> 00:31:19.730
<v Speaker 4>But most of us are walking around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ship that we're walking around with is</v>

761
00:31:19.731 --> 00:31:24.731
<v Speaker 4>just an inside job and it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your job as a human to to exercise</v>

762
00:31:25.131 --> 00:31:25.964
<v Speaker 4>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

763
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to do it every day that that's</v>

764
00:31:28.281 --> 00:31:29.900
<v Speaker 4>what you're trying to get better is all</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

765
00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:32.180
<v Speaker 4>And then we fail at it constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fail every day.</v>

766
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.620
<v Speaker 5>But there's also like a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of you that should be upset with the way</v>

767
00:31:38.181 --> 00:31:42.530
<v Speaker 5>you look so that you force yourself to</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the gym and he keeps you healthy.</v>

768
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 4>That'll west Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked about this last time I was</v>

769
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:47.400
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know where every guy is,</v>

770
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.110
<v Speaker 4>but they're disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're actually disgusting.</v>

771
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

772
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.630
<v Speaker 5>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they're just fucking each other</v>

773
00:31:52.631 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 5>in the street cause they're not dogs</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you don't want to go to the</v>

774
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 5>steam room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

775
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 5>I just left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lived in West Hollywood for three</v>

776
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:00.340
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>

777
00:32:00.341 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 5>I went to the Locker Room in that gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>24 hour fitness once cause I had to pee</v>

778
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 5>so bad as Hollywood is the one I always</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about.</v>

779
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 5>My friend used to be the manager there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to go to the 24 hour bastard.</v>

780
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I used to go to the 24 hour fitness and</v>
<v Speaker 5>woodland hills and there was a guy that</v>

781
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 5>worked there that was my friend who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>a manager.</v>

782
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.200
<v Speaker 5>They sent him over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was at another 24 hour fitness but he</v>

783
00:32:20.201 --> 00:32:22.450
<v Speaker 5>was like a really good well organized</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>

784
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 5>well liked and they sent him to West</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood to clean up and he said he got</v>

785
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:29.800
<v Speaker 5>there and dudes were just gone at it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sauna and they would have to mop it</v>

786
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:31.180
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said it was insane.</v>

787
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 5>He said it was basically just a gay</v>
<v Speaker 5>hookup spot.</v>

788
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.643
<v Speaker 5>The whole</v>

789
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.860
<v Speaker 4>frankly is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made it really real,</v>

790
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 4>but beyond just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the sex or whatever,</v>

791
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 4>this idea that you have to look perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's never enough.</v>

792
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:49.610
<v Speaker 4>And that's why for me it's like that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>why gay marriage was so important.</v>

793
00:32:49.611 --> 00:32:53.140
<v Speaker 4>Not because of the weather you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get married,</v>

794
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 4>not is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that all these people that</v>

795
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 4>could never get married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to stay in the rat race</v>

796
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that if you always felt like you</v>

797
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 4>had to stay in the rat race because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same equality of being in a relationship</v>

798
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 4>that was sanctioned by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as silly as that may all be in at some</v>

799
00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:11.780
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that you just had to stay</v>

800
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 4>in this race forever and then one day</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 50 and you're trying to look like</v>

801
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:19.820
<v Speaker 4>you're 20 because you're still in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>race because you never found someone,</v>

802
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.710
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a guy or a girl or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

803
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 4>that you can start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

804
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.680
<v Speaker 4>maturing into some other thing with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

805
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 4>And that's why your quality was</v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

806
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Equality was important to me,</v>

807
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 4>not whether someone actually gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>married and Milo and I have great</v>

808
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 4>debates on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

809
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.820
<v Speaker 4>but that you got to get out cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing sadder than,</v>

810
00:33:36.821 --> 00:33:39.080
<v Speaker 4>than those people that never stopped</v>

811
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.900
<v Speaker 5>to you on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if those people are on</v>

812
00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 5>antidepressants and cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might be having a great time,</v>

813
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.740
<v Speaker 5>but maybe they're happier than me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hash the expendable income.</v>

814
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

815
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.130
<v Speaker 4>they got her hair plugs and there 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond imagining they look good.</v>

816
00:33:54.131 --> 00:33:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying they don't look it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but actually they don't look that good</v>

817
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.600
<v Speaker 4>because their muscles are too big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

818
00:33:58.601 --> 00:34:00.550
<v Speaker 4>they all just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shirts are too tight.</v>

819
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.520
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like settle down everybody.</v>

820
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's,</v>

821
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.250
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

822
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to work out at Gold's gym on</v>

823
00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:09.820
<v Speaker 5>coal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

824
00:34:09.821 --> 00:34:11.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know where that is in West</v>

825
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.300
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like right down the street from</v>

826
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:17.920
<v Speaker 5>sunset and Gower Studios.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to do news radio at sunset and</v>

827
00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:19.690
<v Speaker 5>so there was a gold's gym down the</v>
<v Speaker 5>street and I'm like,</v>

828
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.990
<v Speaker 5>oh well I'll just make a membership</v>
<v Speaker 5>there that way over at lunch I can just</v>

829
00:34:22.991 --> 00:34:25.000
<v Speaker 5>shoot over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get a workout in real quick and get by.</v>

830
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Because I had just gotten used to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>set life,</v>

831
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.700
<v Speaker 5>like life on the set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a new sitcom,</v>

832
00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.750
<v Speaker 5>you're working at a minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If those sitcoms not going well,</v>

833
00:34:34.751 --> 00:34:38.050
<v Speaker 5>like Newsradio wasn't really going well</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like we're trying to find</v>

834
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.760
<v Speaker 5>its legs in the early days and we would</v>
<v Speaker 5>work 1214 hours a day and it was really</v>

835
00:34:42.761 --> 00:34:45.130
<v Speaker 5>hard to do stand up at night and it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>really hard to work out.</v>

836
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.060
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn man.</v>

837
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.340
<v Speaker 5>And same with like my hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

838
00:34:48.341 --> 00:34:49.630
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to stay in shape.</v>

839
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.230
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's a lot of scenes on news</v>

840
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:53.800
<v Speaker 5>radio where I had to take my shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like a kind of a part of who I</v>

841
00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:55.660
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want him to replace me.</v>

842
00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:58.660
<v Speaker 5>I better fucking keep going to the gym</v>
<v Speaker 5>and pus on vein.</v>

843
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.690
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went over to this gold's gym and I</v>

844
00:35:01.691 --> 00:35:05.410
<v Speaker 5>didn't know that that was exactly like</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 24 hour fitness West Hollywood.</v>

845
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.560
<v Speaker 5>It was just a gay disco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to feel like a tasty little</v>

846
00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:12.610
<v Speaker 5>morsel and a big homos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would walk in there like a wounded</v>

847
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:15.910
<v Speaker 5>antelope trailing up to the waterhole</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was all these dudes with like</v>

848
00:35:15.911 --> 00:35:18.700
<v Speaker 5>scrunchy socks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like from fucking Olivia Newton,</v>

849
00:35:18.701 --> 00:35:20.410
<v Speaker 5>John,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get physical and they would have</v>

850
00:35:20.411 --> 00:35:24.520
<v Speaker 5>timberlands on and cutoff Jimmy's we'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing animals.</v>

851
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.710
<v Speaker 5>It just fucking big yoked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>steroid up dudes just gay or than the</v>

852
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.350
<v Speaker 5>day is long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a,</v>

853
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.370
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was interesting because it made me</v>

854
00:35:33.371 --> 00:35:36.880
<v Speaker 5>feel like what it must feel like to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>woman who's not interested in getting</v>

855
00:35:36.881 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who goes to</v>

856
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 2>the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

857
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Well when I first moved to West</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>

858
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I first was intimidated by it because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

859
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at this gym with all these like huge</v>

860
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 2>muscly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

861
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And then as time went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started enjoying it because I was</v>

862
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually ridiculous.</v>

863
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 2>It really is a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take it just at that,</v>

864
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.230
<v Speaker 2>which that's the level you are taking it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

865
00:35:56.231 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 2>you walk in there and go look at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot and timber who worked out in</v>

866
00:35:58.411 --> 00:35:59.190
<v Speaker 2>timberlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

867
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 2>But you're not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually do with Jean shorts.</v>

868
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:05.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you building a log cabin or</v>

869
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 2>working out like spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sending rather a very clear</v>

870
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.290
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for some Dick and this</v>

871
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 2>is how you get it with Timberland's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw that flag up.</v>

872

<v Speaker 2>there's no like subtlety and daisy</v>

874
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Dukes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daisy dukes on whether you're a guy or a</v>

875
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:21.930
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

877
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 2>the universal flag of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for Dick,</v>

878
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 2>I got to get some new shorts.</v>

879
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Daisy did something about the daisy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dukes,</v>

880
00:36:30.841 --> 00:36:32.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

881
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.080
<v Speaker 2>and when guys started adopt them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

882
00:36:34.081 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right buddy.</v>

883
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all goes to like,</v>

884
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of this stuff about,</v>

885
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 2>what are we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay Marriage or any of the stuff.</v>

886
00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:43.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like enough already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>

887
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:45.390
<v Speaker 2>It exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like plot support,</v>

888
00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to say one thing.</v>

889
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I support you doing whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do.</v>

890
00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 2>If you want to wear a daisy dukes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck a bunch of dudes who cares,</v>

891
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:54.240
<v Speaker 2>go have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

892
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.520
<v Speaker 2>this is a short experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 49 years old,</v>

893
00:36:57.521 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 2>so I'm almost 50 which is if everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes great,</v>

894
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm halfway dead and it's probably not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go that great.</v>

895
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 2>All the accident pot and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a little faith in some of the</v>

896
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 2>robotics that are coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the gene stuff,</v>

897
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 2>but I mean realistically I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan on that.</v>

898
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 2>And then I also got some dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're on the good side of it,</v>

899
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:17.880
<v Speaker 2>but on the good side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also issues like fucking</v>

900
00:37:17.881 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 2>asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supervolcanoes Zombie invasion,</v>

901
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 2>alien attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the fuck's going to go</v>

902
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:24.750
<v Speaker 2>down in the next couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

903
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.560
<v Speaker 2>my point is this is a short ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that long.</v>

904
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.780
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's a long time when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>

905
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.530
<v Speaker 2>because when you're 22 you look at 81</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

906
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 2>it's so far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're 50 and you look at 80</v>

907
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 2>like Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's around the corner a year is not</v>

908
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems long when you've only gone</v>

909
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 2>through 20 of them in your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

910
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so long here.</v>

911
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait until I'm 21 you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all the sudden you look back</v>

912
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:52.591
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

913
00:37:52.591 --> 00:37:54.370
<v Speaker 2>this thing happened in the blink of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>

914
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 2>My from 30 to 40 which I turned this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year went so fast.</v>

915
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember my 30th birthday and I</v>

916
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.200
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now like I'm not a kid anymore.</v>

917
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I,</v>

918
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 2>you can push it into your twenties</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

919
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.040
<v Speaker 2>You can get through your 20s and still</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're somehow not an adult maybe</v>

920
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 2>or but 30 then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well shit,</v>

921
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.410
<v Speaker 2>now I'm kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's like wow,</v>

922
00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 2>I just turned 40 and it's like now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is real.</v>

923
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:19.860
<v Speaker 2>This is really real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in now.</v>

924
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think the key is to not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on that,</v>

925
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 2>to be aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to recognize it,</v>

926
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:28.290
<v Speaker 2>to address it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to concentrate on,</v>

927
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:30.030
<v Speaker 2>and this is such a fucking cliche</v>
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>

928
00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>but I tried to say it as much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

929
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 2>living in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just being here in the taking care of</v>

930
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>your</v>

931
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.180
<v Speaker 5>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

932
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 5>respect your meet vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take care of that thing,</v>

933
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 5>but try to enjoy this thing and live in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moment.</v>

934
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 5>And the more you don't live in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment,</v>

935
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 5>the more you get caught up in bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more it gets away from you.</v>

936
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 5>And then anxiety and nonsense and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>this stupidity and that kind of goes</v>

937
00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 5>back to trump with his fucking wacky</v>
<v Speaker 5>hair like you not living in the moment.</v>

938
00:38:56.351 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 5>If you're a 70 year old guy and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>spraying your hair down with a fucking</v>

939
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 5>gallon of aquanet before you go out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows what you're doing,</v>

940
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.830
<v Speaker 5>everybody knows what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the piece.</v>

941
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:08.170
<v Speaker 5>That's the piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like everyone knows some shame,</v>

942
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 5>that fucking head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're worth $18 billion,</v>

943
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe he's not really worth that much.</v>

944
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing we have no freaking clue</v>

945
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to do with them.</v>

946
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Come on and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it.</v>

947
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 5>He did that today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if he did it today,</v>

948
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 5>one day before the election he went in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>landslide.</v>

949
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 5>He would get there would be such</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive real towards him.</v>

950
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Like you guys would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's wonderful.</v>

951
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>David would endorse him.</v>

952
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean it would be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

953
00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious as to the backlash against</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump,</v>

954
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 5>not the current backlash against trump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when it's going to come from other</v>

955
00:39:41.741 --> 00:39:45.640
<v Speaker 5>people because people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when whenever someone is perceived to be</v>

956
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 5>a bully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether he is or not,</v>

957
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 5>you can make your own choice decision</v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

958
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 5>But I think he is and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>think he is and I think that's also</v>

959
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:56.830
<v Speaker 5>probably one of the reasons why he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>been so successful is because he's so</v>

960
00:39:56.831 --> 00:40:00.940
<v Speaker 5>ruthlessly competitive and he thinks of</v>
<v Speaker 5>himself so highly and those sorts of</v>

961
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:05.020
<v Speaker 5>traits like narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>narcissistic traits are oftentimes very</v>

962
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 5>prevalent.</v>

963
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.030
<v Speaker 5>And people that are successful in</v>
<v Speaker 5>business,</v>

964
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 5>like really successful like he is when</v>
<v Speaker 5>he puts his name on everything and he's</v>

965
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 5>branded everything and everything's</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump this and trump that.</v>

966
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 5>He has no notion whatsoever staying low</v>
<v Speaker 5>key.</v>

967
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:20.700
<v Speaker 5>Well w when you fight against like he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>really mad at Alec Baldwin on Snl for</v>

968
00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:25.270
<v Speaker 5>doing what I think is hilarious and</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

969
00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really well done.</v>

970
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.880
<v Speaker 5>Like that thing that they do grab him by</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Bougie,</v>

971
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.823
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does that.</v>

972
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 5>Alec Baldwin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his best work I think since fucking</v>

973
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 5>beetle juice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

974
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well what is the one,</v>

975
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:39.160
<v Speaker 5>the one glengarry Glen Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably his best work since the coffee</v>

976
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:42.390
<v Speaker 5>is for closers line has been this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

977
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.460
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny and he gets angry.</v>

978
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.610
<v Speaker 5>Like Jon Stewart did a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was doing this,</v>

979
00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

980
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 5>stand up for veterans for some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit and he did this bit where he</v>

981
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 5>started reading off these twitter</v>
<v Speaker 5>exchanges between him and Donald Trump</v>

982
00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 5>that Donald Trump just started tweeting</v>
<v Speaker 5>at him in the,</v>

983
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.080
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a tweet from one 30 in the morning.</v>

984
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

985
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.091
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

986
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:08.620
<v Speaker 5>probably have seen some of the brand</v>
<v Speaker 5>new,</v>

987
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 5>it's brand new,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this standup bit.</v>

988
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.061
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should watch.</v>

989
00:41:11.061 --> 00:41:11.780
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't seen it.</v>

990
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 5>So let's pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

991
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 5>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Jon Stewart,</v>

992
00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.660
<v Speaker 5>I think we could actually play this</v>
<v Speaker 5>unused.</v>

993
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm friends with John Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure he would let us play it cause</v>

994
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he'd also agree that this is</v>

995
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 5>kind of important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it just shows you,</v>

996
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.310
<v Speaker 5>it's not whether or not Donald Trump's</v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative approach and make America</v>

997
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:32.140
<v Speaker 5>great again and not letting in terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all that stuff.</v>

998
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 5>All the things you may or not agree</v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

999
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 5>We're just talking about from a</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological standpoint,</v>

1000
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.370
<v Speaker 5>from looking at him as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

1001
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 5>there's some thing off here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something incorrect about his</v>

1002
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 5>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's,</v>

1003
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 5>you're hitting a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of this stuff.</v>

1004
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:48.164
<v Speaker 5>So we can look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

1005
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 5>let's watch this because it's pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking funny</v>

1006
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 1>to find out somebody was tweeting weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit about me.</v>

1007
00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.803
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1008
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>So on April 24 2013 at 11:00 AM someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into my office and says,</v>

1009
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump just tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you I'm much smarter than</v>

1010
00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Leibowitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1011
00:42:16.531 --> 00:42:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way is totally overrated.</v>

1012
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.573
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1013
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.140
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to say something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is real,</v>

1014
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.093
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1015
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And I don't necessarily disagree with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1016
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.193
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

1017
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>

1018
00:42:37.511 --> 00:42:41.830
<v Speaker 1>as you might say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that about?</v>

1019
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

1020
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.790
<v Speaker 1>so we're not quite sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't quite figure it out.</v>

1021
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days later,</v>

1022
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.860
<v Speaker 1>he tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've said many times before,</v>

1023
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart is highly overrated.</v>

1024
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:02.540
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

1025
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I swear this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tweets again if John Stewart is so</v>

1026
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 1>above it all and legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did he change his name from Jonathan</v>

1027
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Liebowitz?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should be proud of his heritage.</v>

1028
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1029
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy wants to be president.</v>

1030
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:18.651
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

1031
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:19.484
<v Speaker 1>let me keep going.</v>

1032
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1033
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Then he tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jon Stewart,</v>

1034
00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a total phony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should cherish his past,</v>

1035
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.260
<v Speaker 1>not run from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I start to think to myself like,</v>

1036
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this guy's trying to let people</v>

1037
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:38.771
<v Speaker 1>know I'm a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think to myself like does it my</v>

1038
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:43.544
<v Speaker 1>face to do that.</v>

1039
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.530
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1040
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where have you seen this face other</v>

1041
00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:52.090
<v Speaker 1>than a poster for Yentl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What world are people like Stewart?</v>

1043
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a Scottish name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about that fella.</v>

1044
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.580
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1045
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.250
<v Speaker 1>That looks a little shmear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be funny if it wasn't so</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxically fucking crude and horrible,</v>

1047
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:17.030
<v Speaker 1>but so I decided to tweet back at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have any people don't know this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people on twitter picked up on the name</v>

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>radio silence.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I shit you not</v>

1071
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 1>greatest country in the world at one 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mall.</v>

1072
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.143
<v Speaker 6>Morning</v>

1073
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.070
<v Speaker 1>tweeted little Jon Stewart is a pussy.</v>

1074
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:45.963
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1075
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Hopeless in a debate with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vote wisely this November.</v>

1076
00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Well that that line at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1077
00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.550
<v Speaker 2>really says it all right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wisely this November,</v>

1078
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:04.570
<v Speaker 2>because this is where we're at now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Stewart is a pussy,</v>

1079
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.440
<v Speaker 2>is that that speaks volumes too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who fucking tweet?</v>

1080
00:47:08.441 --> 00:47:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's what?</v>

1081
00:47:10.001 --> 00:47:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Seven year old tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that was running for</v>

1082
00:47:12.341 --> 00:47:13.750
<v Speaker 2>President John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do something.</v>

1083
00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:15.520
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1084
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to defend Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second on this,</v>

1085
00:47:18.881 --> 00:47:23.140
<v Speaker 2>which is he is using the system against</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1086
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.750
<v Speaker 2>So he's using the trolling tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew what,</v>

1087
00:47:26.751 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 2>what is his ultimately?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1088
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 2>That's all insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all completely,</v>

1089
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 4>utterly insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strange like antisemetic dog whistling.</v>

1090
00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:36.000
<v Speaker 4>Although it's as if John Stewart hiding</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that he's Jewish.</v>

1091
00:47:36.001 --> 00:47:39.070
<v Speaker 4>It talks about being Jewish everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's so much bizarre lunacy in</v>

1092
00:47:39.071 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 4>there in the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what my best defense of him is not</v>

1093
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 4>that he look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy's obviously a narcissist.</v>

1094
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 4>He obviously has some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>personality disorder and all kinds of</v>

1095
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 4>other shit and and shady business</v>
<v Speaker 4>practices and we don't know the taxes</v>

1096
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:53.380
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The defense I can give of him is that</v>

1097
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 4>he's using the system against itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all of this corrupt media bullshit,</v>

1098
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:59.560
<v Speaker 4>all of this political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of this,</v>

1099
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.840
<v Speaker 4>the outrage culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the stuff we've been talking about,</v>

1100
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 4>he purposely does it just to keep his</v>
<v Speaker 4>name out there.</v>

1101
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 4>So these idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1102
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 4>the lapdog media just keeps giving him</v>
<v Speaker 4>free attention.</v>

1103
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.050
<v Speaker 4>And then by giving him free attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have to spend the money,</v>

1104
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 4>but all the other candidates do.</v>

1105
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Hillary's outspending him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the numbers are,</v>

1106
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:22.030
<v Speaker 4>but I bet you it's something like 20 to</v>
<v Speaker 4>one and it's like he's just using it.</v>

1107
00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 4>So does he believe any of this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's saying and is that morally wrong</v>

1108
00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:27.520
<v Speaker 4>and ethically gross?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1109
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 4>But he's just using the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

1110
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people are saying,</v>

1111
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:32.141
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1112
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 4>if it had only been rubio and although a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of Democrats,</v>

1113
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 4>whenever we'd only been rubio or Romney</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Jeb Bush,</v>

1114
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.580
<v Speaker 4>it would have been so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the shit,</v>

1115
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:42.140
<v Speaker 4>whether they're calling him anti women</v>
<v Speaker 4>are anti gay or Antioch,</v>

1116
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.290
<v Speaker 4>they would have been saying it about</v>
<v Speaker 4>them too because they did it.</v>

1117
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember what they were saying about</v>

1118
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 4>Romney four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had binders of women,</v>

1119
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:49.480
<v Speaker 4>he hates women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hates him.</v>

1120
00:48:49.481 --> 00:48:52.210
<v Speaker 4>Or like I would probably vote for Romney</v>
<v Speaker 4>at this point.</v>

1121
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.410
<v Speaker 4>He did say binders of women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1122
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.880
<v Speaker 4>But it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they took it out of context.</v>

1123
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 4>There's a talking point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what politics is all</v>

1124
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's important to know?</v>

1125
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.440
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you and I think his use of</v>

1126
00:49:05.441 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 4>really ridiculous statements and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>is brilliant because he does force the</v>

1127
00:49:08.711 --> 00:49:10.450
<v Speaker 4>media to report on some of the things he</v>
<v Speaker 4>says.</v>

1128
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.560
<v Speaker 4>But that was 2013 he was running for</v>
<v Speaker 4>president then,</v>

1129
00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1130
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.840
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has always used it for his own</v>

1131
00:49:16.841 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 4>purposes just to keep his own celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

1132
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everything he's done from,</v>

1133
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:26.320
<v Speaker 4>from any point that I can remember him</v>
<v Speaker 4>from in the 80s to forward has been to</v>

1134
00:49:26.321 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 4>further his own brand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his own empire,</v>

1135
00:49:29.051 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 4>his own money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that stuff.</v>

1136
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 4>And now he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing exactly what the media has</v>

1137
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:35.890
<v Speaker 4>demanded in a weird way.</v>

1138
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the media doesn't even wait for us</v>

1139
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:39.910
<v Speaker 4>to get outraged anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1140
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 4>they're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these people at all of these,</v>

1141
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>daily beast,</v>

1142
00:49:43.991 --> 00:49:47.090
<v Speaker 4>all these sites that somehow we're all</v>
<v Speaker 4>considered legit and nothing personal</v>

1143
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:48.220
<v Speaker 4>against daily beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just picking one,</v>

1144
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:52.300
<v Speaker 4>but like they're literally just waiting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for him to tweet so that they can write</v>

1145
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 4>the article about the outrage that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweet,</v>

1146
00:49:54.461 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 4>because they don't even wait for us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be outraged.</v>

1147
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 4>They just start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like he's just feeding them.</v>

1148
00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 4>He's feeding the monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knowing it keeps getting more clicks.</v>

1149
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.880
<v Speaker 4>The more clicks and views he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more they'll want to talk about him.</v>

1150
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 4>The more money it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the networks.</v>

1151
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:11.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like he really is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just playing the game really well.</v>

1152
00:50:11.711 --> 00:50:14.080
<v Speaker 4>He's playing the game brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a great,</v>

1153
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 4>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does a great job at it.</v>

1154
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:16.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1155
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 4>he loves wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he used to do stuff with the WWF</v>

1156
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 4>b because he gets that and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are missing here.</v>

1157
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.530
<v Speaker 4>So we can talk all about all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>policies and whether he actually has a</v>

1158
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>personality</v>

1159
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 5>disorder and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in terms of the tactics,</v>

1160
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 5>he's just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>

1161
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they invited me to go on celebrity</v>

1162
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 5>apprentice back when we did the second</v>
<v Speaker 5>version of fear factor,</v>

1163
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 5>which I guess was like 2011 or 12 or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1164
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 5>I forget what year it was and I should</v>
<v Speaker 5>have done it.</v>

1165
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to do it cause I would</v>
<v Speaker 5>have had to move to New York for like</v>

1166
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:48.584
<v Speaker 5>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1167
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 5>But my family was down when they are</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1168
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 5>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1169
00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:54.080
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe fuck that.</v>

1170
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 5>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1171
00:50:56.091 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just this,</v>

1172
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like showers.</v>

1173
00:50:58.741 --> 00:50:59.574
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1174
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 5>maybe if it was a show that I've watched</v>
<v Speaker 5>and joy,</v>

1175
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 5>but I'd never watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wish I did now because I wanted</v>

1176
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have some insight.</v>

1177
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:10.400
<v Speaker 5>I love to be around that guy and pick</v>
<v Speaker 5>his brain because Jeff Ross was around</v>

1178
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.670
<v Speaker 5>him when they roasted him for comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>central and he said the guy was very</v>

1179
00:51:13.671 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is when they roasted him.</v>

1180
00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:17.960
<v Speaker 5>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he signed up for the roast and Jeff had</v>

1181
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 5>a conversation with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1182
00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:20.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they turn to you and they're saying</v>

1183
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.180
<v Speaker 5>jokes about you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should laugh because it looks bad if</v>

1184
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:24.430
<v Speaker 5>you're just sitting there like you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>upset,</v>

1185
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:25.540
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or make you look better if you like.</v>

1186
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.780
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1187
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 5>Like he like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he seemed very reasonable.</v>

1188
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.540
<v Speaker 5>I think there's something about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's very concerned with perception,</v>

1189
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 5>hence the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1190
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 5>Like he's very concerned with control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very concerned with all these</v>

1191
00:51:36.561 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like in a lot of ways,</v>

1192
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.840
<v Speaker 5>this is sort of a psychological profile</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as it is a presidential race.</v>

1193
00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like we're watching two different</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are extremely flawed.</v>

1194
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 5>Like she is not honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

1195
00:51:50.871 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very dishonest person.</v>

1196
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 5>There's an incredible amount of data to</v>
<v Speaker 5>point that she is incredibly dishonest.</v>

1197
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's dishonest about the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 5>Foundation,</v>

1198
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:03.680
<v Speaker 5>dishonest about the emails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dishonest,</v>

1199
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 5>completely about Bengazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when they were trying to</v>

1200
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 5>say Bengazi was all in response to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube video,</v>

1201
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 5>which she knew it wasn't the proven</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1202
00:52:11.721 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1203
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.020
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

1204
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:17.630
<v Speaker 5>very disturbing when you consider the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that it's not,</v>

1205
00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.210
<v Speaker 5>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't disqualify you from running</v>

1206
00:52:20.211 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 5>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't like if you're going to have</v>

1207
00:52:22.701 --> 00:52:24.830
<v Speaker 5>someone who represents the people of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1208
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 5>as John Stuart said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I agree the greatest country in the</v>

1209
00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:30.470
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should have someone who's honest.</v>

1210
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.080
<v Speaker 5>And he look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even Barack Obama's turned out through</v>

1211
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Speaker 5>these wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1212
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>releases that he lied about not knowing</v>

1213
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:39.530
<v Speaker 5>that Valerie Clinton had that email</v>
<v Speaker 5>server.</v>

1214
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had,</v>

1215
00:52:40.521 --> 00:52:42.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had commented on it and he had</v>

1216
00:52:42.081 --> 00:52:44.690
<v Speaker 5>emailed her on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's not true.</v>

1217
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing is very,</v>

1218
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:48.560
<v Speaker 5>very sorted in many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

1219
00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 5>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1220
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Gary Johnson keeps fucking out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had him on the podcast before and I</v>

1221
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:55.430
<v Speaker 5>enjoyed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked talking to him,</v>

1222
00:52:55.431 --> 00:53:00.130
<v Speaker 5>but how do you not know what Aleppo is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know where to Aleppo the way,</v>

1223
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 5>but I knew what was going on in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't know the name of the city</v>

1224
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:04.220
<v Speaker 5>that was getting bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1225
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.010
<v Speaker 5>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1226
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.810
<v Speaker 5>the media is disingenuous when they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they find that Aleppo moment with</v>

1227
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 5>Gary Johnson and suddenly that's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>lead story all over the place or for 24</v>

1228
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:13.430
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all over twitter cause it's like</v>

1229
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.930
<v Speaker 5>you guys ignored everything he says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now he screwed up once and now that's</v>

1230
00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:20.890
<v Speaker 5>the way you discredit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I've had Gary Johnson on my show,</v>

1231
00:53:20.891 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 5>so I chatted with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1232
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.950
<v Speaker 5>he was going on Larry King when I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>over at or,</v>

1233
00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 5>and we had about a half hour before</v>

1234
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.190
<v Speaker 4>we went on air in the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy is,</v>

1235
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 4>he's a perfectly decent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lovely human being.</v>

1236
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 4>He's not dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a nice guy.</v>

1237
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to smoke pot with them and</v>

1238
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 4>go skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

1239
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that said in August,</v>

1240
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 4>I did a video on my channel where I</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1241
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 4>I will support this guy to get to 15% to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get him in the,</v>

1242
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.210
<v Speaker 4>in the debates because we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you like him or not,</v>

1243
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 4>we desperately need another voice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talk about limited government,</v>

1244
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 4>talk about why uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taxes should be low or whatever it is.</v>

1245
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I failed at that.</v>

1246
00:53:57.661 --> 00:54:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I tried but from that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from about mid August to the debate,</v>

1247
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 4>he had about 10 horrific moments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I actually think as much as I like</v>

1248
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 4>him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's done the libertarians,</v>

1249
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:10.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in a certain way the country a major</v>

1250
00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 4>disservice by being so ill prepared for</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1251
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 4>So many people would have been excited</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have heard an actual imagine if there</v>

1252
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:20.040
<v Speaker 4>was a libertarian right now obviously</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to win like a Ross Perot</v>

1253
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 4>type character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ross Perot type or just someone who had</v>

1254
00:54:22.831 --> 00:54:24.840
<v Speaker 4>a certain command of the issues because</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary,</v>

1255
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:26.760
<v Speaker 4>he's googling all of the reasons that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>like him,</v>

1256
00:54:26.761 --> 00:54:28.930
<v Speaker 4>but he's kind of goofy and silly and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1257
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.010
<v Speaker 4>he stammers a lot and he speaks in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny way in his body.</v>

1258
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Language is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1259
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 4>slide in a slippery or I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point is,</v>

1260
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 4>this was the year if there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're ever going to have a third</v>

1261
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a third choice,</v>

1262
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was the year where it could have</v>

1263
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 4>made a real dent the way Ross Perot did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Gary could have,</v>

1264
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 4>it should have been the libertarian</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate more than,</v>

1265
00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.571
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jill Stein,</v>

1266
00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1267
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:57.230
<v Speaker 4>But Gary just at every opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>show that he knows what he's doing can,</v>

1268
00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.360
<v Speaker 4>can speak clearly about the issues he</v>
<v Speaker 4>failed.</v>

1269
00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:01.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not,</v>

1270
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:04.350
<v Speaker 4>he's for having the government forced</v>
<v Speaker 4>the India,</v>

1271
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.520
<v Speaker 4>Indiana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1272
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Baker to bake the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you not?</v>

1273
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:09.630
<v Speaker 4>He's a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of these,</v>

1274
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 4>forcing them to bake a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he isn't even a great,</v>

1276
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.720
<v Speaker 4>but I even said this in my video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1277
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:17.250
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy's not a great libertarian.</v>

1278
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's a great candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a republican and he wouldn't get</v>

1279
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 4>in New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a republican and he was a good</v>

1280
00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 4>two term governor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Weld,</v>

1281
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:24.320
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 4>This is running mate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the former governor of</v>

1283
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:30.060
<v Speaker 4>So if they're both decent fellows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1285
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 4>They're both decent fellows and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just not what makes you the</v>

1286
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:33.150
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

1287
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 4>But this was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they missed a huge opportunity.</v>

1288
00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:40.610
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if there just been a well-spoken</v>
<v Speaker 4>libertarian who could just have elicited</v>

1289
00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 4>what the points of libertarianism is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it would look,</v>

1290
00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:49.280
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to flip the election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it could have done something and,</v>

1291
00:55:49.281 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 4>and I think he was the wrong guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a dirty business,</v>

1292
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.340
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons why</v>

1293
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton is good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a dirty person.</v>

1294
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I say that with no ill will.</v>

1295
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't hate that lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What she does is dirty.</v>

1296
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 4>And if you look at what the DNC did to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders,</v>

1297
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 4>that's dirty and what she did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as that woman got fired from the</v>

1298
00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:11.610
<v Speaker 4>DNC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she hires her immediately.</v>

1299
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's so incredibly transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think how corrupt really how corrupt</v>

1300
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is again why I talk about the</v>

1301
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:21.060
<v Speaker 4>left a lot because they need to call out</v>
<v Speaker 4>their side.</v>

1302
00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 4>We will be very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be very easy for us,</v>

1303
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.590
<v Speaker 2>for us to sit here and just mock the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right the whole time and we can get</v>

1304
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:29.340
<v Speaker 2>further into trump and mock the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and talk about problem is,</v>

1305
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in a left and a right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1306
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just within the way we have to</v>

1307
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 2>sort of frame the discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1308
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:36.551
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1309
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:38.980
<v Speaker 2>the labels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all ridiculous at this point.</v>

1310
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 2>But think about how corrupt the DNC is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the head of</v>

1311
00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:46.300
<v Speaker 2>the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find out she's rigging it for</v>

1312
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She steps down in shame,</v>

1313
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.010
<v Speaker 2>literally the same day or the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

1314
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 2>then we'll start same day she starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>working for the Hillary campaign.</v>

1315
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Then Donna Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>

1316
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 2>who's a democratic super delegate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1317
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.400
<v Speaker 2>She's a democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super dope.</v>

1318
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Who CNN had on is a contributor as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>she could possibly give you any,</v>

1319
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:05.801
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:08.170
<v Speaker 2>remotely honest answer on anything.</v>

1321
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:13.270
<v Speaker 2>She then becomes the head of the DNC and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then now it's of course come out on Wiki</v>

1322
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:16.600
<v Speaker 2>leaks in the last week that she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding Hillary questions for the</v>

1323
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:19.750
<v Speaker 2>debates so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you may hate the Republicans for all</v>

1324
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your fans out there that hate the</v>

1325
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still got to acknowledge that there</v>

1326
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:27.420
<v Speaker 2>is something deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply corrupt with the Democrats and</v>

1327
00:57:27.421 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's the head of that simply simply</v>

1328
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:33.220
<v Speaker 2>put deeply corrupt against Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanders who's also a democrat.</v>

1329
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Hillary Clinton is is a hustler and</v>

1330
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:40.360
<v Speaker 2>she knows how to put it all together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got,</v>

1331
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 2>and the both of the Clintons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hustlers,</v>

1332
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.270
<v Speaker 2>they keep these people close to them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1333
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 2>they make sure that everyone is taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of.</v>

1334
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's people from other countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>that donate money to the Clinton can</v>

1335
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.760
<v Speaker 2>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's all these different people,</v>

1336
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 2>like when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she hired that woman for her</v>

1337
00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not unusual like standard</v>

1338
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 2>operational procedure for the Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

1339
00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like how she's conducted business</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1340
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 2>that's what we don't like about</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

1341
00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 2>What we don't like about politics is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cronyism and the established roots that</v>

1342
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 2>they have developed over 30 plus years</v>
<v Speaker 2>in government.</v>

1343
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's happening right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because of wikileaks,</v>

1344
00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to see how the sausage is</v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

1345
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:25.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a theory anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the last couple of years where,</v>

1346
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.390
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of online people would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming about the government's</v>

1347
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:29.890
<v Speaker 2>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media is in bed with them,</v>

1348
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1349
00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 2>they are pitching softball interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So well now we're seeing that it's</v>

1350
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 2>actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's actual evidence in email</v>

1351
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>saying yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give softball stories too easy.</v>

1352
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Reporters at the New York Times don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to this person,</v>

1353
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:43.024
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

1354
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing all of it now and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to a head and then you throw</v>

1355
00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 2>trump into it and you throw trolling and</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet culture and you get all of that</v>

1356
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:50.290
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

1357
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:55.270
<v Speaker 2>And back to that popcorn that we started</v>
<v Speaker 2>with now it's all bubbling at once and</v>

1358
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all comes down to tomorrow.</v>

1359
00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And I also think there's waves of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1360
00:58:59.441 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 2>There's waves of outrage and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people sort of get resigned to it all</v>

1361
00:59:03.221 --> 00:59:06.070
<v Speaker 2>because they get their own life calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1362
00:59:06.071 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 2>like if you really wanted to delve deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the Clintons or delve deep into</v>

1363
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:14.970
<v Speaker 2>trump and just that would absorb every</v>
<v Speaker 2>second of your day for decades really,</v>

1364
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:19.120
<v Speaker 2>really would with both of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to live and it's always</v>

1365
00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:21.030
<v Speaker 2>been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember Jeff Gannon?</v>

1366
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember who he is?</v>

1367
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 5>It sounds familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gimme a little shop again and was a</v>

1368
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 5>embedded reporter in the White House who</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually spent time sleeping at the</v>

1369
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:32.300
<v Speaker 5>White House.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had slept in the White House and more</v>

1370
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 5>than one occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this was during the Bush</v>

1371
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:37.490
<v Speaker 5>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he would ask the most ridiculous</v>

1372
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:39.560
<v Speaker 5>questions that you would never think</v>
<v Speaker 5>that a reporter would ask.</v>

1373
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1374
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 5>like mister president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when are the Democrats going to wake up</v>

1375
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 5>and come to their senses?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like those kind of questions,</v>

1376
00:59:47.361 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 5>like just completely ridiculous leading</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions.</v>

1377
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 5>Complete softballs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1378
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it turned out that he,</v>

1379
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 5>this is like when the Internet was just</v>
<v Speaker 5>starting to emerge,</v>

1380
00:59:57.741 --> 00:59:59.120
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was during the Bush administration.</v>

1381
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:04.450
<v Speaker 5>It turned out that he was a gay escort</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he ran an all military gay escort</v>

1382
01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:10.520
<v Speaker 5>service any more like fucking dog tags</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a towel over his dick.</v>

1383
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:13.440
<v Speaker 5>And he was straddled on the ground with</v>
<v Speaker 5>combat boots on his,</v>

1384
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.880
<v Speaker 5>in his online ad that I've seen him at</v>
<v Speaker 5>24 hour fitness.</v>

1385
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.570
<v Speaker 5>And he's the manager that's the guy with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mop.</v>

1386
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:24.020
<v Speaker 5>So they realize that this fucking guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1387
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:27.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean this was how they got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1388
01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:31.280
<v Speaker 5>this is how they got the questions that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to be asked and presented the,</v>

1389
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the narrative that they wanted to push.</v>

1390
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 5>But this has always been the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always been ridiculous.</v>

1391
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:42.041
<v Speaker 5>People who are almost like vampire</v>
<v Speaker 5>familiars who stay close to the master</v>

1392
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 5>and so they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1393
01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:49.580
<v Speaker 5>in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>feed off of whatever power that he has</v>

1394
01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:50.930
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and capitalize on it,</v>

1395
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:52.880
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Debbie Wasserman Schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's,</v>

1396
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does a woman's name that's the</v>

1397
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 5>attorney general that Clinton met on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tarmac and his jet.</v>

1398
01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lynch.</v>

1399
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.760
<v Speaker 5>Loretta Lynch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That story.</v>

1400
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a private meeting.</v>

1401
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump's been hitting that over the head</v>

1402
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:08.690
<v Speaker 5>and he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time he says it,</v>

1403
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:09.021
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1404
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:09.470
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

1405
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.230
<v Speaker 5>They had a meeting in the plane for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple minutes right before the</v>

1406
01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 5>indictment didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1407
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.290
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why people like Scott Adams,</v>

1408
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:18.470
<v Speaker 5>who was a very reasonable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's coming on soon.</v>

1409
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:19.770
<v Speaker 5>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He will.</v>

1410
01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.010
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of what I said before about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trump tactics,</v>

1411
01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 5>he came on my show and he laid it out so</v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly,</v>

1412
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:25.941
<v Speaker 5>and he at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at that point,</v>

1413
01:01:25.941 --> 01:01:28.040
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't supporting trump really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think,</v>

1414
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 5>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think now he officially his,</v>

1415
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 5>but his whole point was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not the policy.</v>

1416
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.470
<v Speaker 5>Understand what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trolling,</v>

1417
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 5>understand the leading that he does and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then comes in after all of that.</v>

1418
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 5>He fully gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

1419
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:42.620
<v Speaker 5>you're going to love talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1420
01:01:42.621 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like what trump represents to a</v>

1421
01:01:45.561 --> 01:01:47.870
<v Speaker 5>lot of people that are supporting him is</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll,</v>

1422
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.190
<v Speaker 5>they're willing to look past all of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>flaws and all the bullshit and the</v>

1423
01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:57.191
<v Speaker 5>bullying and the craziness because he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>something completely unique that has</v>

1424
01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.950
<v Speaker 5>never run for president before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What he is he,</v>

1425
01:01:59.951 --> 01:02:04.951
<v Speaker 5>what he represents is a guy who has been</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside but is also outside.</v>

1426
01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:10.550
<v Speaker 5>He is independent in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 5>financially and he's also independent in</v>

1427
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 5>terms of his connections and his</v>
<v Speaker 5>obligations to them.</v>

1428
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 5>One of the things about him being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>narcissist and one the things about him</v>

1429
01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 5>being a guy who probably have a whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of friends</v>

1430
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.940
<v Speaker 3>is that in establishing that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming the super successful guy who's</v>

1431
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 3>really concerned only about himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's immune to all that cronyism</v>

1432
01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:32.880
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to do that and you're</v>

1433
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 3>seeing that like the way he's hammering</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary on all these different things,</v>

1434
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 3>the way he's attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he got paid to be at Hillary's</v>

1435
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 3>fucking wedding or hillary rather got</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid to be at his wedding.</v>

1436
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 3>He paid</v>
<v Speaker 3>her donation for her to show up at his</v>

1437
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:51.440
<v Speaker 3>wedding or fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1438
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy that's been deeply</v>

1439
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:54.900
<v Speaker 3>embedded in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1440
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 3>in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to his credit then he points that</v>

1441
01:02:57.301 --> 01:02:57.721
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1442
01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:00.870
<v Speaker 3>in the first debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first republican debate,</v>

1443
01:03:00.871 --> 01:03:02.790
<v Speaker 3>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said it within the first 10 minutes.</v>

1444
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1445
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I gave her money and she showed up to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>wedding.</v>

1446
01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 3>That's how corrupt the system is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're totally right.</v>

1447
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 3>What's happening is people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so frustrated,</v>

1448
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 3>they're frustrated about language and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the bullshit and seeing all the</v>

1449
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 3>nonsense between the media and the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House correspondence dinner where,</v>

1450
01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:20.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it nerd prom and all the,</v>

1451
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.700
<v Speaker 3>they're supposed to be guarding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians and instead they're having</v>

1452
01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:26.040
<v Speaker 3>dinner with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could go through the list of the</v>

1453
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 3>amount of people that are on CNN that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are married to public.</v>

1454
01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:31.170
<v Speaker 3>People are work for campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1455
01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I just mentioned the Donna Brazil thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a good Jew,</v>

1456
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Paul Begala for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he runs a hillary SUPERPAC.</v>

1457
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:38.620
<v Speaker 3>He's on CNN as an analyst like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

1458
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 3>everyone is now seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was the idea of it.</v>

1459
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 3>But now because of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing all of it and people have</v>

1460
01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 3>just had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>

1461
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.850
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants to be close to power in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain way.</v>

1462
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 3>So if you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had Barack Obama,</v>

1463
01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you're the president in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can probably in your first interview</v>

1464
01:03:55.771 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 3>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time you met him might go a</v>

1465
01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:01.230
<v Speaker 3>little easier hoping that he might come</v>
<v Speaker 3>back again because you'd like to be</v>

1466
01:04:01.231 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 3>around it a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Man Dude,</v>

1467
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 3>I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope not.</v>

1468
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:07.630
<v Speaker 3>You go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would show up drunk and high and I had</v>

1469
01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 3>to go like let's kill it says do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1470
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Let's just do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what's up.</v>

1471
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>But he gets a chance to give you the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

1472
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

1473
01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but likely there would be like some</v>

1474
01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 3>serious consequences if I didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1475
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1476
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 3>so that's the real concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's two things.</v>

1477
01:04:23.221 --> 01:04:26.880
<v Speaker 3>There's one is that he won't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ask if you are going to demand a</v>

1478
01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:29.130
<v Speaker 3>really hard interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a really,</v>

1479
01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:29.790
<v Speaker 3>really high degree.</v>

1480
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 3>They'd be a hard interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would do if I had a chance to sit</v>

1481
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:36.150
<v Speaker 3>down with Barack Obama because he's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>much older than me.</v>

1482
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's only a couple of years older than</v>

1483
01:04:37.531 --> 01:04:39.060
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had essentially could hang out</v>

1484
01:04:39.061 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 3>with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in a lot of ways,</v>

1485
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.950
<v Speaker 3>let's forget about what he's done and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drones and the attacks on whistle</v>

1486
01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 3>blowers and the attacks on the freedom</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the press.</v>

1487
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 3>There's been a lot of horrible things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have occurred during this</v>

1488
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:52.500
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been one of the wars</v>

1489
01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:55.020
<v Speaker 3>administrations in terms of freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the press.</v>

1490
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem to say much about</v>

1491
01:04:57.421 --> 01:04:58.350
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all,</v>

1492
01:04:58.570 --> 01:04:59.940
<v Speaker 3>cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bullshit.</v>

1493
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.860
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't believe in this left</v>
<v Speaker 3>and right thing.</v>

1494
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:03.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like the raiders versus the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins.</v>

1495
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 3>You pick a team and your team can do no</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1496
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would talk to him about is what</v>

1497
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 3>does it like being a human being under</v>
<v Speaker 3>that immense amount of pressure.</v>

1498
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 3>And is that job even manageable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

1499
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 3>is it possible for one person to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>be for 300</v>

1500
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 4>and whatever million people there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>

1501
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:22.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's right,</v>

1502
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.010
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's donald trump's got to put it</v>

1503
01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 4>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think we're voting for a cane.</v>

1504
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 4>They don't realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1505
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:30.910
<v Speaker 4>there's simple civics things that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to know that they don't know</v>

1506
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:32.050
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff that you should have learned in</v>

1507
01:05:32.051 --> 01:05:35.020
<v Speaker 4>seventh grade social studies that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have three branches of government.</v>

1508
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 4>The president is one branch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the executive branch.</v>

1509
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 4>All he is supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president doesn't write laws,</v>

1510
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:42.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All he is supposed to do is sign the</v>

1511
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:44.730
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congress writes the law that the</v>

1512
01:05:44.731 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 4>legislative branch and then the judicial</v>
<v Speaker 4>branch and the courts actually make sure</v>

1513
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:51.490
<v Speaker 4>that they're legal and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>separation of powers in a balance so</v>

1514
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:52.241
<v Speaker 4>that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1515
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:55.000
<v Speaker 4>checks and balances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they make sure no branch gets too</v>

1516
01:05:55.001 --> 01:05:56.440
<v Speaker 4>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you think about it,</v>

1517
01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.780
<v Speaker 4>think about what the last two years have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been like for this election.</v>

1518
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.630
<v Speaker 4>People think we're voting on a king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Hillary,</v>

1519
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:03.460
<v Speaker 4>I can solve this and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1520
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:05.050
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can do all these shit,</v>

1521
01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.300
<v Speaker 4>why didn't you tell brock these last</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight years?</v>

1522
01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I'll bring all the jobs back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1523
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 4>you were on his team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so maybe you should have mentioned that.</v>

1524
01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all bullshit.</v>

1525
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.600
<v Speaker 4>And then when trump says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only one that can solve</v>

1526
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 4>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only one that can make the</v>

1527
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:17.791
<v Speaker 4>economy grading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1528
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1529
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.830
<v Speaker 4>you're just a part of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1530
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:24.250
<v Speaker 4>You're a big part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we fetishize the president in a way</v>

1531
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 4>that we don't the other branches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a problem.</v>

1532
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

1533
01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 4>they're not a king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we have to remind ourselves of that.</v>

1534
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Speaker 4>And for the people that are really ready</v>
<v Speaker 4>to jump off the bridge tomorrow if</v>

1535
01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 4>they're a guy loses or gal or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Gal.</v>

1536
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for those people,</v>

1537
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 4>the hope is that the system is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be stronger than either one of these</v>

1538
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 4>two people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Ha if,</v>

1539
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're not at that point,</v>

1540
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.040
<v Speaker 4>then we're really in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You already established so that the</v>

1541
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:50.150
<v Speaker 4>system itself is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1542
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 4>it's just busted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just busted.</v>

1543
01:06:52.151 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 4>But that's why they're voting trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing,</v>

1544
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.800
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think about trump,</v>

1545
01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 4>what of progressive hated all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

1546
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:01.510
<v Speaker 4>they hate Christian conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what?</v>

1547
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Trump's not a Christian conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't give a fuck he had,</v>

1548
01:07:04.631 --> 01:07:07.330
<v Speaker 4>they're all supporting him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've oddly at the highest numbers,</v>

1549
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think trump really cares about</v>

1550
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.530
<v Speaker 4>abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an old school pussy grabber.</v>

1551
01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:15.320
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an old school pussy grabber.</v>

1552
01:07:15.321 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 4>O.</v>
<v Speaker 4>S.</v>

1553
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:20.120
<v Speaker 4>P.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't care about abortion each</v>

1554
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 4>Jesus tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

1555
01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:23.524
<v Speaker 4>You can have that one.</v>

1556
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 4>But he doesn't care about abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't care about gay rights.</v>

1557
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.010
<v Speaker 4>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gave the,</v>

1558
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:31.000
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the RNC at the convention,</v>

1559
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:33.370
<v Speaker 4>he talked about gay rights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It got out of pause,</v>

1560
01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:35.260
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He brought Peter Teal up there to talk</v>

1561
01:07:35.261 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 4>about being openly gay and they loved</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1562
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:39.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a lot of ways stablish that</v>

1563
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:44.560
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton was anti gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 4>until 2013 when it became convenient.</v>

1564
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 4>She is on record many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many times of saying that she believes</v>

1565
01:07:47.741 --> 01:07:49.390
<v Speaker 4>in a marriage between a man and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1566
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.090
<v Speaker 4>But that's what just incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>regressive of,</v>

1567
01:07:52.091 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 4>well that's what they all do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wait now,</v>

1568
01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 4>even Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like he waited,</v>

1569
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:56.830
<v Speaker 4>waited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waited until Obama,</v>

1570
01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.173
<v Speaker 4>Obama.</v>

1571
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even Obama didn't do it until Biden</v>

1572
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:04.960
<v Speaker 4>was on meet the press and he like kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of slipped.</v>

1573
01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:06.670
<v Speaker 4>And then the next day Obama was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me too,</v>

1574
01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying Mo Bama,</v>

1575
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Michelle Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she ran,</v>

1576
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.140
<v Speaker 4>she could probably fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you want to talk about a woman who</v>

1577
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:19.141
<v Speaker 4>has been in the White House who has</v>
<v Speaker 4>shown an incredible resolve at her,</v>

1578
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 4>the way she speaks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>

1579
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 4>she's like a very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very articulate,</v>

1580
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:27.830
<v Speaker 4>very composed person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she could win.</v>

1581
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does it tell you though,</v>

1582
01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 4>that I have heard than Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

1583
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably rather have 100% yeah,</v>

1584
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.790
<v Speaker 4>100% so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what she thinks it,</v>

1585
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.600
<v Speaker 4>but he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a president is,</v>

1586
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:42.523
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here.</v>

1587
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting here talking about I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know she's not as compromised.</v>

1588
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she would be if she got that job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is that ultimately where we're at is</v>

1589
01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:54.410
<v Speaker 4>that the system is so corrupt that all</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could choke out all the two years</v>

1590
01:08:54.411 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 4>of this bullshit could give us at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>end was these two.</v>

1591
01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Like I kind of think they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they perfectly deserve each other,</v>

1592
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.900
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to look and find out</v>
<v Speaker 4>what went wrong,</v>

1593
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:05.690
<v Speaker 4>you got to look in the mirror because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>all have to look at ourselves and say,</v>

1594
01:09:05.691 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 4>how did we all allow this to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a joke at first.</v>

1595
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 4>The trump thing was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1596
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 4>I'll fully own up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when he first got in,</v>

1597
01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 4>I said he's going to be in three debates</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's it.</v>

1598
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.530
<v Speaker 4>And he was definitely in three debates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1599
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he stayed for the fourth and I</v>

1600
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:21.374
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>

1601
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.070
<v Speaker 4>he's better at talking to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's used to being on camera and he's</v>

1602
01:09:25.071 --> 01:09:28.160
<v Speaker 4>used to insulting people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when Marco Rubio tried to insult</v>

1603
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was terrible.</v>

1604
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:30.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1605
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 4>he's not good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not something you just pick</v>

1606
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 4>up on.</v>

1607
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.110
<v Speaker 4>It was like watching an open mic comic</v>
<v Speaker 4>half to like headline the biggest show</v>

1608
01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:37.944
<v Speaker 4>of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1609
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 4>he just couldn't get the words out</v>
<v Speaker 4>properly.</v>

1610
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to that point maybe so far for all</v>

1611
01:09:44.361 --> 01:09:47.390
<v Speaker 4>the things that we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that trump,</v>

1612
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the best sales job I could give her a</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump would be that he has a lot,</v>

1613
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.480
<v Speaker 4>his family has a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have everything to live for.</v>

1614
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:54.870
<v Speaker 4>They have everything that most of us</v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

1615
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.530
<v Speaker 4>material assets and what all of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1616
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he really people that are like,</v>

1617
01:09:59.391 --> 01:10:01.010
<v Speaker 4>he's going to start world war three or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1618
01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:03.680
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fight North Korea are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that a real concern though</v>

1619
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 4>that with his hubris and the way he</v>
<v Speaker 4>treats opponents in business and the way</v>

1620
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:11.150
<v Speaker 4>he treats opponents socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Rosie O'donnell,</v>

1621
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I go the way he does sort of conduct</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself that that is not something that</v>

1622
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 4>you can do if you want to talk to some</v>
<v Speaker 4>foreign leader.</v>

1623
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a con for sure.</v>

1624
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not diminishing that.</v>

1625
01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:25.370
<v Speaker 4>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I say on the show with him,</v>

1626
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what his moral center is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1627
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I just have no sense of is this really</v>
<v Speaker 4>all about him or is this,</v>

1628
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 4>does he really feel does like in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>truest moment of him,</v>

1629
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:40.520
<v Speaker 4>does he feel that the country really has</v>
<v Speaker 4>been derailed and is he just using the</v>

1630
01:10:40.521 --> 01:10:44.660
<v Speaker 4>trolling tactics to just get something</v>
<v Speaker 4>good out of it?</v>

1631
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 4>My point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he has,</v>

1632
01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:50.090
<v Speaker 4>well I was saying he has a lot to lose</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like maybe he,</v>

1633
01:10:50.091 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 4>this is the moment where he finally like</v>
<v Speaker 4>came around and was like,</v>

1634
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 4>I have no one's going to stop this</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>

1635
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 4>this corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this awful shit that you're talking</v>

1636
01:10:59.031 --> 01:11:00.680
<v Speaker 4>about with Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe he's like,</v>

1637
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only one that can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1638
01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.910
<v Speaker 4>that's the best way I can frame it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling you that's,</v>

1639
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.380
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a really fantasy based view of it</v>

1640
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.790
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not based on his actual words,</v>

1641
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's impossible to base any of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

1642
01:11:13.401 --> 01:11:13.990
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1643
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.570
<v Speaker 3>So how do we base any of this on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>words?</v>

1644
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 3>We know that is lying left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1645
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've seen the thing,</v>

1646
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:23.010
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the s the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 3>director giving the description of what</v>

1647
01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Hillary did and then her saying what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>FBI had said.</v>

1648
01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean it is so horrifically</v>

1649
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 3>inaccurate and dishonest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

1650
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:35.760
<v Speaker 3>how does that not immediately disqualify</v>
<v Speaker 3>you in any other time?</v>

1651
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:37.680
<v Speaker 3>It would because she was running</v>
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>

1652
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 3>let's put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she was running against Obama and</v>

1653
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:41.760
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

1654
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:44.130
<v Speaker 3>this was the Hillary Clinton that we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been exposed to.</v>

1655
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like our standards have dropped so</v>
<v Speaker 3>low,</v>

1656
01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:49.620
<v Speaker 3>but the media would have been all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>her because they liked Obama.</v>

1657
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's what's happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump has been the great unifier to take</v>

1658
01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:55.290
<v Speaker 3>all of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressives and liberals,</v>

1659
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:56.630
<v Speaker 3>and we'll all these people and even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1660
01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.470
<v Speaker 3>the never trump conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people,</v>

1661
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.720
<v Speaker 3>they're all unified in just their hatred</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trump.</v>

1662
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.570
<v Speaker 3>And then that gets them to ignore all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horrible shit about Hillary.</v>

1663
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 3>So like the stuff with the emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she,</v>

1664
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 3>when the guy basically call me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out and he was like,</v>

1665
01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:09.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't negligent with sort of,</v>

1666
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.950
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's basically an idiot.</v>

1667
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know what she was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't negligent.</v>

1668
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's grounds to be fired at most jobs</v>

1669
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.780
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't screw up something really,</v>

1670
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 3>really important and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1671
01:12:19.981 --> 01:12:22.250
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it in purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just an idiot who's not.</v>

1672
01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even that it's illegal and illegal.</v>

1673
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Who would go to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1674
01:12:26.861 --> 01:12:28.860
<v Speaker 3>What everything she did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she was a sailor,</v>

1675
01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the story about the,</v>

1676
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the naval officer who took photos and</v>

1677
01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even an officer as an enlisted</v>

1678
01:12:36.651 --> 01:12:39.450
<v Speaker 3>guy who took photos of the inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear cockpit.</v>

1679
01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 3>He's facing 10 years in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just took photos on his phone.</v>

1680
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Top secret shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1681
01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 3>did you see this in last two days that</v>
<v Speaker 3>hillary was having her cleaning lady</v>

1682
01:12:46.831 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 3>print emails?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Classified emails there.</v>

1683
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Wikileaks is showing things where she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying have her print it,</v>

1684
01:12:51.931 --> 01:12:54.030
<v Speaker 3>have her print deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll over Anthony Wiener thing that</v>

1685
01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:54.870
<v Speaker 3>she had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huma,</v>

1686
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:59.370
<v Speaker 3>huma forwarded her fucking classified</v>
<v Speaker 3>emails to Anthony Wiener's account and</v>

1687
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:03.420
<v Speaker 3>then printed them up because I guess his</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer was hooked up to the fucking</v>

1688
01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 3>printer in the house so he could print</v>
<v Speaker 3>his dick pics.</v>

1689
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>

1690
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 3>well he was he printing them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you send them once you find the</v>

1691
01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 3>large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm otherwise you get no traction.</v>

1692
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 3>You can't send actual size dick pics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say ask you this before we get any</v>

1693
01:13:15.751 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 3>further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you want?</v>

1694
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Either one of them to win and if you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a preference or a you like Iti,</v>

1695
01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 3>want to step back and watch this nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>explosion.</v>

1696
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Go off and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of those three options.</v>

1697
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't want this thing to blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1698
01:13:29.651 --> 01:13:30.930
<v Speaker 3>one of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I say on the show all</v>

1699
01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 3>the time is that our country is still so</v>
<v Speaker 3>good and we don't realize it.</v>

1700
01:13:34.681 --> 01:13:37.950
<v Speaker 3>We think that it's just this endless</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting and this awfulness.</v>

1701
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.870
<v Speaker 3>There's so much good here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wake up.</v>

1702
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I know we're a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a little different as as public</v>

1703
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the average person wakes up here.</v>

1704
01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.830
<v Speaker 3>They can say what they want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>

1705
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.830
<v Speaker 3>you can say what you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get a decent job.</v>

1706
01:13:49.831 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we go to New York City and go on a</v>

1707
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:57.030
<v Speaker 3>subway and be with literally every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single person from every part of the</v>

1708
01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:58.140
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from every,</v>

1709
01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.810
<v Speaker 3>every ethnicity and nationality and</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and race and sexuality,</v>

1710
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.730
<v Speaker 3>and we're all here and we're not killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1711
01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:05.190
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that we could do a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1712
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that the system's</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken.</v>

1713
01:14:06.871 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still pretty damn good here.</v>

1714
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Almost everyone in the world still wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come here.</v>

1715
01:14:11.381 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>

1716
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 4>How many of your friends are leaving</v>
<v Speaker 4>America?</v>

1717
01:14:13.601 --> 01:14:15.340
<v Speaker 4>I know Lena Dunham's going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be all right.</v>

1718
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 4>She's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if trump wins,</v>

1719
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:18.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she said that yeah,</v>

1720
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 4>she'd going to Mexico or Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a lot of problems of her own.</v>

1721
01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1722
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Let's not waste that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1723
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.680
<v Speaker 4>so I was at her butt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1724
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 4>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my overriding point would be I don't</v>

1725
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:32.740
<v Speaker 4>want to blow the system up to that level</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's really like,</v>

1726
01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:34.880
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I didn't say,</v>

1727
01:14:34.881 --> 01:14:37.190
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean like watch this nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 5>explosion go off.</v>

1728
01:14:37.191 --> 01:14:41.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm at an event like this isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow's and event and we're going to</v>

1729
01:14:41.151 --> 01:14:43.460
<v Speaker 5>sit back and watch how this event plays</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1730
01:14:43.461 --> 01:14:44.630
<v Speaker 5>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you want to say?</v>

1731
01:14:44.631 --> 01:14:44.860
<v Speaker 5>Who you are</v>

1732
01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.320
<v Speaker 4>voting for him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>

1733
01:14:46.321 --> 01:14:47.430
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in California,</v>

1734
01:14:47.431 --> 01:14:48.840
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I haven't said this publicly.</v>

1735
01:14:48.841 --> 01:14:50.700
<v Speaker 4>I figured I would sort of wait until</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

1736
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:53.700
<v Speaker 4>So we're in California here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know Hillary's Wayne in</v>

1737
01:14:53.701 --> 01:14:56.160
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the two of us have a little bit of a</v>

1738
01:14:56.161 --> 01:15:00.170
<v Speaker 4>luxury to do something that might be</v>
<v Speaker 4>more principled than what that</v>

1739
01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.513
<v Speaker 4>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1740
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Then what the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in Ohio or you're in Florida</v>

1741
01:15:04.861 --> 01:15:06.600
<v Speaker 4>or Colorado or whatever your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your votes,</v>

1742
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally every single person's vote</v>

1743
01:15:09.361 --> 01:15:13.740
<v Speaker 4>match highlights how fucking goofy this</v>
<v Speaker 4>system is so completely does.</v>

1744
01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I now there are people that trading</v>

1745
01:15:15.571 --> 01:15:17.730
<v Speaker 4>votes over state lines and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy things.</v>

1746
01:15:17.731 --> 01:15:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my biggest thing this time is that the</v>

1747
01:15:20.521 --> 01:15:23.730
<v Speaker 4>system is just mangled and we need more</v>
<v Speaker 4>voices.</v>

1748
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.750
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1749
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:27.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm not totally sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My gut feeling is I'm going to vote for</v>

1750
01:15:27.571 --> 01:15:32.571
<v Speaker 4>Gary Johnson for all the wrong reasons</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I just want somebody to realize</v>

1751
01:15:32.671 --> 01:15:34.890
<v Speaker 4>down the road that four years from now</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should have somebody else.</v>

1752
01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:40.130
<v Speaker 4>But I think you can make equally strong</v>
<v Speaker 4>cases for trump and for Hillary and</v>

1753
01:15:40.171 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 4>equally wrong cases for both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1754
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.070
<v Speaker 4>because everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it's funny,</v>

1755
01:15:44.071 --> 01:15:45.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll ask you the same question,</v>

1756
01:15:45.661 --> 01:15:47.250
<v Speaker 4>but just from what we've talked about</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1757
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:52.700
<v Speaker 4>my sense is you're going to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hillary in the most begrudging possible</v>

1758
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:54.870
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I am.</v>

1759
01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.730
<v Speaker 4>If I was going to vote for Hillary,</v>

1760
01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 5>so think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have to,</v>

1761
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.970
<v Speaker 5>I would have to have a way that I could</v>
<v Speaker 5>justify supporting her.</v>

1762
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Not just a way that I didn't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump should be the president.</v>

1763
01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 5>It's all in my mind for the system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1764
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.221
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1765
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:16.930
<v Speaker 5>it's far better if</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not even done,</v>

1766
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.720
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1767
01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:23.680
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think my options are either</v>
<v Speaker 5>voting for Gary Johnson or writing</v>

1768
01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:26.630
<v Speaker 5>someone in and I don't think Gary</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnson should be pressing.</v>

1769
01:16:26.631 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1770
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not going to be,</v>

1771
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:29.960
<v Speaker 5>so you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And clean coach,</v>

1772
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 5>he was president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1773
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:34.120
<v Speaker 5>the guy did a great job as a governor of</v>
<v Speaker 5>New Mexico and I mean,</v>

1774
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:39.160
<v Speaker 5>what would I find disagreeable about him</v>
<v Speaker 5>is so much different than what I found</v>

1775
01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:42.340
<v Speaker 5>disagreeable about George Bush and</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Bush was president for eight</v>

1776
01:16:42.341 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I find disagreeable about him,</v>

1777
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.020
<v Speaker 5>like his only,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his lack of preparedness,</v>

1778
01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:50.710
<v Speaker 5>but I think he's a very disciplined guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think he prepared well</v>

1779
01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:53.110
<v Speaker 5>enough about foreign policy and about a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of other issues.</v>

1780
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:56.500
<v Speaker 5>And I also think the pressure of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>national media and the spotlight of that</v>

1781
01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.030
<v Speaker 5>uniquely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1782
01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:01.420
<v Speaker 5>the Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Journalism is something unique that he</v>

1783
01:17:01.421 --> 01:17:04.180
<v Speaker 5>had not experienced before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think how depressing</v>

1784
01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.450
<v Speaker 4>that is with everything going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for as much as you and I are in this</v>

1785
01:17:07.451 --> 01:17:08.550
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in it in a,</v>

1786
01:17:08.551 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 4>in a public way that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we both may be will begrudgingly the</v>

1787
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:15.410
<v Speaker 4>day before the election kind of be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ad we're going to vote for the guy that</v>

1788
01:17:15.411 --> 01:17:16.970
<v Speaker 4>definitely can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1789
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:21.140
<v Speaker 4>think about the shit that you've just</v>
<v Speaker 4>said about Hillary that is seriously</v>

1790
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:23.840
<v Speaker 4>damning shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really Damn Shit.</v>

1791
01:17:23.841 --> 01:17:24.770
<v Speaker 4>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris,</v>

1792
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 4>who is one of my heroes who I know</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've had on a zillion times and I've</v>

1793
01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:29.780
<v Speaker 4>had him on and he did the best sell job</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could on Hillary.</v>

1794
01:17:29.781 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's supporting her.</v>

1795
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:32.870
<v Speaker 4>And I think it just is not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1796
01:17:32.871 --> 01:17:36.330
<v Speaker 4>it's mostly trump's of funny little</v>
<v Speaker 4>article about the,</v>

1797
01:17:36.331 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the war,</v>

1798
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the best of two evils or I mean,</v>

1799
01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.410
<v Speaker 4>not a whole article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whole podcast about it.</v>

1800
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think he makes some good points</v>

1801
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:46.160
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1802
01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 4>he absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look,</v>

1803
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 4>I hold him as high as I can hold</v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

1804
01:17:49.911 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 4>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1805
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:57.100
<v Speaker 4>but I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the best way this could go down is</v>

1806
01:17:57.261 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 4>that if you don't want the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're really afraid of what could</v>

1807
01:17:59.601 --> 01:18:00.434
<v Speaker 4>happen with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1808
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 4>that it's just like the rules have just</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed forever and it just doesn't</v>

1809
01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:05.980
<v Speaker 4>sound right that trump would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

1810
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.430
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this reality TV star.</v>

1811
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 4>If you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really afraid of that.</v>

1812
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:13.940
<v Speaker 4>I think the best argument for Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 4>then would be that get her in the system</v>

1813
01:18:13.941 --> 01:18:18.941
<v Speaker 4>basically keeps chugging along and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>good liberals and decent conservatives</v>

1814
01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:23.150
<v Speaker 4>and Libertarians and the people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>really aren't on the fringes that are</v>

1815
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:25.100
<v Speaker 4>dragging everybody apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1816
01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Like the real regressive left people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real outright people.</v>

1817
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.220
<v Speaker 4>But everyone else kind of comes together</v>
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

1818
01:18:31.221 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 4>we're going to change things over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next couple of years.</v>

1819
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:33.531
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1820
01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm giving you a real like kind of pie</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the sky.</v>

1821
01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1822
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:39.430
<v Speaker 4>let's try to spin this positively stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>ABC after school special.</v>

1823
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Like that's really what I'm giving you</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1824
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:43.820
<v Speaker 4>Cause I got nothing left with one day to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go in this fucking thing.</v>

1825
01:18:43.821 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what I would say is that it's</v>

1826
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:47.990
<v Speaker 4>become obvious to me over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1827
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 4>the average conservative who I may</v>
<v Speaker 4>disagree with on taxes or abortion or</v>

1828
01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:54.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not my enemy.</v>

1829
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 4>They're not as a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not my enemy.</v>

1830
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:00.830
<v Speaker 4>And we can find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to find room to be okay with</v>

1831
01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:01.880
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1832
01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:05.480
<v Speaker 4>all this whole election is just a result</v>
<v Speaker 4>of not being okay if demonizing</v>

1833
01:19:05.481 --> 01:19:07.040
<v Speaker 4>everybody to the point that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil.</v>

1834
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.040
<v Speaker 4>And then what did we end up with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got this.</v>

1835
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.400
<v Speaker 4>So the best argument for Hillary I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>is let her have for years,</v>

1836
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:14.900
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing is going to be scandal</v>
<v Speaker 4>written.</v>

1837
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:19.490
<v Speaker 4>No matter what she's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is about not letting people just do</v>

1838
01:19:19.491 --> 01:19:20.720
<v Speaker 4>their own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>

1839
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:22.530
<v Speaker 4>that's a big part of what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1840
01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.720
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain,</v>

1841
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 4>explain what you just said about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole reason why we're in this.</v>

1842
01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.270
<v Speaker 4>We're in this position because we've got</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause over the last however long because</v>

1843
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:33.830
<v Speaker 4>of cable news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because a twitter,</v>

1844
01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:36.410
<v Speaker 4>because of all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all everyone caters their news to</v>

1845
01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 4>themselves and then demonizes everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1846
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:42.260
<v Speaker 4>So everyone on the right will tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're all lived hard,</v>

1847
01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:44.480
<v Speaker 4>left socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist,</v>

1848
01:19:44.481 --> 01:19:46.700
<v Speaker 4>Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everyone on the left will tell you</v>

1849
01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:49.190
<v Speaker 4>that they're all racist white</v>
<v Speaker 4>supremacist Nazis.</v>

1850
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's like neither one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are true.</v>

1851
01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there could be,</v>

1852
01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when,</v>

1853
01:19:53.691 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people argue about abortion and it's</v>

1854
01:19:55.581 --> 01:19:58.910
<v Speaker 4>like everyone on the left will say that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people on the right,</v>

1855
01:19:58.911 --> 01:20:00.410
<v Speaker 4>they're against abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hate women.</v>

1856
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:03.560
<v Speaker 4>And people on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll say that people on the left are</v>

1857
01:20:03.561 --> 01:20:05.180
<v Speaker 4>for abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they hate babies.</v>

1858
01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 4>And guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not really true either.</v>

1859
01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 4>One of those,</v>

1860
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 3>you got to realize that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's much more in common that we all</v>

1861
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:12.031
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1862
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:14.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like obviously like that's not</v>

1863
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.400
<v Speaker 3>rocket science and we have to realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people can have different political</v>

1864
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 3>opinions and that way you can still find</v>
<v Speaker 3>some room.</v>

1865
01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:23.990
<v Speaker 3>There is some place Democrats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans used to work together so</v>

1866
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civility and just common,</v>

1867
01:20:27.541 --> 01:20:32.340
<v Speaker 3>the common bond of being American and</v>
<v Speaker 3>being so incredibly fortunate to be born</v>

1868
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 3>on this awesome patch of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1869
01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:37.170
<v Speaker 3>that's really what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the lottery winners when it comes</v>

1870
01:20:37.171 --> 01:20:38.880
<v Speaker 3>to the world and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree.</v>

1871
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of does better.</v>

1872
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.160
<v Speaker 3>And it was a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1873
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 3>there be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just ignore them.</v>

1874
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose that's where I would live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't live here.</v>

1875
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:48.450
<v Speaker 3>I live in Canada or Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are my two spots.</v>

1876
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Will Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a couple of Australians on</v>

1877
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Shit,</v>

1878
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:56.310
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love us to get the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the people over there.</v>

1879
01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It's such a fucking great place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.760
<v Speaker 3>I Melbourne is fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sydney is awesome sister.</v>

1881
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have their problems too.</v>

1882
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:07.880
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had read up and [inaudible],</v>

1883
01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.690
<v Speaker 3>who's a writer for the Herald Sun in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

1884
01:21:09.691 --> 01:21:10.870
<v Speaker 3>she's at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>born in Iran,</v>

1885
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 3>moved to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

1886
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:16.200
<v Speaker 3>and now she's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's on the right in that she's,</v>

1887
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:17.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would be considered a republican</v>

1888
01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:21.030
<v Speaker 3>here and she's actually fighting against</v>
<v Speaker 3>immigration the way they're doing it</v>

1889
01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:23.610
<v Speaker 3>there because she realized how good that</v>
<v Speaker 3>country is.</v>

1890
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:25.770
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia is the most tolerant nation on</v>

1891
01:21:25.771 --> 01:21:29.400
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're now a unfurling that tolerance</v>

1892
01:21:29.401 --> 01:21:32.670
<v Speaker 3>by allowing everybody and even if even</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't believe the things we</v>

1893
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:34.440
<v Speaker 3>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if they don't want to integrate</v>

1894
01:21:34.441 --> 01:21:36.030
<v Speaker 3>and assimilate properly and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1895
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.400
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very hard on illegal immigrants.</v>

1896
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:41.050
<v Speaker 3>They tend to illegal immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put them on a boat and the ship</v>

1897
01:21:41.051 --> 01:21:43.710
<v Speaker 3>into a fucking island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is happening all over the place</v>

1898
01:21:43.711 --> 01:21:44.850
<v Speaker 3>and they're sinking boats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1899
01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:47.610
<v Speaker 3>there are videos of boats trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Greece and they're just literally</v>

1900
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:48.444
<v Speaker 3>sinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1901
01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1902
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:52.320
<v Speaker 3>but Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

1903
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:53.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some other places that are,</v>

1904
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.120
<v Speaker 3>that are pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fight against people who</v>

1905
01:21:57.121 --> 01:22:00.240
<v Speaker 3>disagree and the demonization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree with you on.</v>

1906
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:03.540
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have a real problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>teams.</v>

1907
01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 3>We have a really real tribal mentality</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's a team of the ride or a team</v>

1908
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:09.630
<v Speaker 3>of the left or even a team of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>independence.</v>

1909
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.080
<v Speaker 3>I've been seeing so many people and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been so disappointed with so many people</v>

1910
01:22:13.081 --> 01:22:18.081
<v Speaker 3>ignoring all the things that Clinton has</v>
<v Speaker 3>done and using that Hashtag I'm with</v>

1911
01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:20.610
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially my friends that are women</v>

1912
01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:24.390
<v Speaker 3>that are really excited about having the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first woman president and like this one,</v>

1913
01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the one you want like this is,</v>

1914
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.660
<v Speaker 3>this is like if you wanted to have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first woman president,</v>

1915
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.790
<v Speaker 3>like wouldn't you want to have a woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was like Obama when he ran for</v>

1916
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:40.380
<v Speaker 3>president was a perfect candidate and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways and a perfect response to</v>

1917
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:41.214
<v Speaker 3>George Bush.</v>

1918
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean take away all the things that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do that he had offered in his</v>

1919
01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:50.550
<v Speaker 3>whole hope and change campaign and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much that he went against,</v>

1920
01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 3>especially really disturbing stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whistle blower thing,</v>

1921
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:57.490
<v Speaker 3>like he was offering support for</v>
<v Speaker 3>whistleblowers and saying that people</v>

1922
01:22:57.491 --> 01:23:00.690
<v Speaker 3>were doing illegal activity and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>expose that there'd be protected,</v>

1923
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:04.350
<v Speaker 3>which has been absolutely not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's to me is like super disturbing</v>

1924
01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>and I think as many</v>

1925
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.110
<v Speaker 4>people said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be on the wrong side of</v>

1926
01:23:08.111 --> 01:23:10.810
<v Speaker 4>history when it comes to that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know how much control or</v>

1927
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:12.550
<v Speaker 4>power they really have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1928
01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:15.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what kind of influences the</v>
<v Speaker 4>president really has in that position,</v>

1929
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.940
<v Speaker 4>but my point is he was a great</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate.</v>

1930
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton is not a great</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate.</v>

1931
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 4>She's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a scary person in a lot of ways.</v>

1932
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:28.480
<v Speaker 4>All this shit that she's been saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Russia being a part of the attack</v>

1933
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:31.240
<v Speaker 4>and the hacks on her email server and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the DNC,</v>

1934
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:33.310
<v Speaker 4>that's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well think about improving,</v>

1935
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:38.080
<v Speaker 4>but she keeps saying that she's offered</v>
<v Speaker 4>up the fact that she would respond</v>

1936
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:43.150
<v Speaker 4>militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>militarily against Russia for her</v>

1937
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:46.540
<v Speaker 4>writing a bunch of fucked up shit in</v>
<v Speaker 4>emails and getting caught for it.</v>

1938
01:23:46.570 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the way you know that it's actual</v>

1939
01:23:48.851 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 4>bullshit and you're not just giving</v>
<v Speaker 4>hyperbole there is that if they were</v>

1940
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 4>doing the things that now the hillary</v>
<v Speaker 4>campaign is claiming and they do it very</v>

1941
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:57.730
<v Speaker 4>caring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very careful with their words</v>

1942
01:23:57.731 --> 01:24:00.720
<v Speaker 4>where they never flat out condemn them</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

1943
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's both.</v>

1944
01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.120
<v Speaker 4>It has to be coming from the road room</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's all,</v>

1945
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:04.841
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1946
01:24:04.841 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a magic trick to keep you off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>topics of the emails,</v>

1947
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 4>which is really the stuff we should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

1948
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.900
<v Speaker 4>But the way you know it's really not</v>
<v Speaker 4>real is that if it was real,</v>

1949
01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:17.370
<v Speaker 4>let's say there was real evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the CIA or the FBI or NSA or whatever</v>

1950
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 4>had real evidence that Russia was</v>
<v Speaker 4>genuinely rigging our elections either</v>

1951
01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:23.920
<v Speaker 4>with trump or without trump or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1952
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:26.650
<v Speaker 4>that would truly be an act of war at</v>
<v Speaker 4>this point.</v>

1953
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.470
<v Speaker 4>That would be an act of war and Obama</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have to be talking about it</v>

1954
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.090
<v Speaker 4>endlessly because that's an alley that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the term rigging the elections and</v>

1955
01:24:34.091 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 4>interfering with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you say Russia,</v>

1956
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:38.080
<v Speaker 4>do you mean a guy in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1957
01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:41.840
<v Speaker 4>cause that's like a guy in America could</v>
<v Speaker 4>have hacked into that sheet.</v>

1958
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean Putin directly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government or do you mean Russian</v>

1959
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:46.230
<v Speaker 4>hackers?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russian citizen.</v>

1960
01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.910
<v Speaker 4>The person who has no connection</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever to the Russian governor who</v>

1961
01:24:48.911 --> 01:24:50.970
<v Speaker 4>may have gotten your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 4>So what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you thought about this?</v>

1963
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:55.550
<v Speaker 4>So all this stuff comes out wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go on the assumption that Hillary</v>

1964
01:24:55.551 --> 01:24:57.670
<v Speaker 4>is going to win tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if,</v>

1965
01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.210
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know I say this with a,</v>

1966
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:02.770
<v Speaker 4>I always quote Carl Sagan on this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was extraordinary.</v>

1967
01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:07.771
<v Speaker 4>Claims require extraordinary evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what if wikileaks or the Russian</v>

1968
01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:12.850
<v Speaker 4>government or whoever it is is right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if they're saving the real shit</v>

1969
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.010
<v Speaker 4>until she's president when they release</v>
<v Speaker 4>it today?</v>

1970
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:15.941
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not.</v>

1971
01:25:15.941 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 4>If you really want it to blackmail the</v>
<v Speaker 4>president of the United States,</v>

1972
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:20.230
<v Speaker 4>black male.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1973
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:23.020
<v Speaker 4>if they wanted to look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want money or something or they</v>

1974
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:25.720
<v Speaker 4>want some [inaudible] global trade</v>
<v Speaker 4>agreements or whatever.</v>

1975
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:25.931
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1976
01:25:25.931 --> 01:25:26.181
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1977
01:25:26.181 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 4>that you release enough so that she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>damaged.</v>

1978
01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Now she gets into the White House and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then either you start continually</v>

1979
01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 4>leaking more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I suspect they've got plenty more.</v>

1980
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 4>You continually leak more to hamper her</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you actually then have some shit</v>

1981
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what if there's some real shit,</v>

1982
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:42.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she was,</v>

1983
01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 4>she facilitated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1984
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:48.250
<v Speaker 4>something worse in Libya or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some other thing and then they</v>

1985
01:25:48.251 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 4>could potentially have some shit on her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which then could actually lead to a war</v>

1986
01:25:52.211 --> 01:25:52.931
<v Speaker 4>with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1987
01:25:52.931 --> 01:25:57.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm just that fully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fully throw the Carl Sagan caveat out</v>

1988
01:25:57.101 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 4>there when I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to think like they have a</v>

1989
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:02.080
<v Speaker 4>political motive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not,</v>

1990
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 4>they're not an a organization.</v>

1991
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Clearly they want to damage hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's something there.</v>

1992
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 3>You're giving me the skeptical eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I,</v>

1993
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1994
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a lot of speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1995
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:13.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is for sure.</v>

1996
01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:15.290
<v Speaker 3>It had anything big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would've already been out.</v>

1997
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody got a couple of hours left.</v>

1998
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they would have released it</v>

1999
01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 3>yesterday or well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not on Sunday.</v>

2000
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just think that there's no way</v>

2001
01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 3>they would've waited this long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2002
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:30.470
<v Speaker 3>the FBI saying that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>reopen the investigation was one of the</v>

2003
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:34.040
<v Speaker 3>most damaging things and that came from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the investigation of Anthony Wiener and</v>

2004
01:26:34.041 --> 01:26:35.510
<v Speaker 3>had nothing to do with wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2005
01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:40.780
<v Speaker 3>It came from just them looking into this</v>
<v Speaker 3>other creep and finding out that he's</v>

2006
01:26:40.941 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 3>sending his dick pics to some 15 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old girl or whatever the fuck he was</v>

2007
01:26:44.001 --> 01:26:44.834
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2008
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think there's anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2009
01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I think what we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've already seen,</v>

2010
01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:50.330
<v Speaker 3>so we have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really have,</v>

2011
01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I think the most damaging thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

2012
01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:54.200
<v Speaker 3>was Colin Powell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his impression of her.</v>

2013
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:56.960
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was horrific because Colin Powell is</v>

2014
01:26:56.961 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 3>such a respected person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You very rarely hear anything negative</v>

2015
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:03.440
<v Speaker 3>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he essentially said that she's a</v>

2016
01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:06.260
<v Speaker 3>moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean or not not a moron and</v>

2017
01:27:06.261 --> 01:27:08.600
<v Speaker 3>intelligent person who's Hubris fucks up</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

2018
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:12.920
<v Speaker 3>which is a way of being a moron and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know hill.</v>

2019
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.210
<v Speaker 3>The thing about bill out dicking Bimbos</v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious,</v>

2020
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he still is.</v>

2021
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 3>And then when Donald Trump brought those</v>
<v Speaker 3>women than he,</v>

2022
01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's allegedly sexually assaulted and he</v>

2023
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 3>brought them and even raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2024
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly brought them to the debate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had them sit there.</v>

2025
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:31.460
<v Speaker 3>There's a photo of a bill looking over</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2026
01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Those women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that?</v>

2027
01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What in the holy fuck was on his mind</v>

2028
01:27:36.081 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 3>when he took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the impression,</v>

2029
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's giving while he's looking over</v>

2030
01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 3>at those women like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So doesn't that go to why people are</v>

2031
01:27:43.671 --> 01:27:44.950
<v Speaker 3>voting for trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2032
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:47.510
<v Speaker 3>One of my best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I'm four years old,</v>

2033
01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.110
<v Speaker 3>he does not care about politics at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could not care less.</v>

2034
01:27:51.111 --> 01:27:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know that he could name the</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice president.</v>

2035
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:56.810
<v Speaker 3>He has been all in on trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never talked more politics with him</v>

2036
01:27:56.811 --> 01:27:59.630
<v Speaker 3>ever in our entire lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My best friends is a right wing guy.</v>

2037
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:02.930
<v Speaker 3>He's completely a political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not big on the government in</v>

2038
01:28:02.931 --> 01:28:04.190
<v Speaker 3>general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't care if you,</v>

2039
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:06.170
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't care what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't hurt him.</v>

2040
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.820
<v Speaker 3>He live and let live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his whole,</v>

2041
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:09.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's ever voted.</v>

2042
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that he just has nothing to do with</v>

2043
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:14.180
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been all about trump because his</v>

2044
01:28:14.181 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 3>whole thing is the system is so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know it and now the guy's</v>

2045
01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:22.820
<v Speaker 3>exposing it and he's willing to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>that risk of what that might mean.</v>

2046
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that sort of what Scott Adams and</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that that's basically the thrust</v>

2047
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:28.460
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are just saying,</v>

2048
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.210
<v Speaker 3>we all knew it was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now someone's showing it to you and</v>

2049
01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't like how he behaves.</v>

2050
01:28:33.861 --> 01:28:36.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't like how he talks about pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like that.</v>

2051
01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:37.940
<v Speaker 3>He says mean things to Rosie old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

2052
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.270
<v Speaker 3>truly gross things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not defending any of those things,</v>

2053
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 3>but like when someone's actually pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>the curtain and showing you the wizard</v>

2054
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:48.040
<v Speaker 3>and now the wizards a little weirder</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you like and they go,</v>

2055
01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget that.</v>

2056
01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's pull the curtain back and get</v>

2057
01:28:50.691 --> 01:28:53.060
<v Speaker 3>another curtain and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what they were all afraid of.</v>

2058
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:56.420
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid of this is their chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they blow it,</v>

2059
01:28:56.930 --> 01:29:00.620
<v Speaker 3>it'll never that the machine will just</v>
<v Speaker 3>swallow everybody up.</v>

2060
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think machine swole and</v>

2061
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what we're seeing is the</v>

2062
01:29:03.991 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 5>inevitable demise of a system that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>wholly incompatible with the Internet.</v>

2063
01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

2064
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:11.610
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that's what's happening.</v>

2065
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This system,</v>

2066
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:18.410
<v Speaker 5>you cannot exist in a world where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think all communication within the next</v>

2067
01:29:19.531 --> 01:29:23.910
<v Speaker 5>20 years is going to be transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your emails to Jamie,</v>

2068
01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your tweets to your mom,</v>

2069
01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:28.050
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's all going to be</v>

2070
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 5>transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

2071
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.990
<v Speaker 5>I think what the Internet is providing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what modern,</v>

2072
01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.740
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>communication is providing is almost</v>

2073
01:29:37.741 --> 01:29:42.741
<v Speaker 5>instantaneous access to data and to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way people feel and express themselves.</v>

2074
01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:45.840
<v Speaker 5>And what we were talking about earlier</v>
<v Speaker 5>with these little pops of popcorn,</v>

2075
01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.090
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're going to boil up to a</v>

2076
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:48.980
<v Speaker 5>gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2077
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 5>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology's not going to stop here.</v>

2078
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:56.100
<v Speaker 5>It's not like what we can do now is as</v>
<v Speaker 5>much as we're going to be able to do in</v>

2079
01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:56.430
<v Speaker 5>the future.</v>

2080
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to continue to progress and</v>

2081
01:29:58.351 --> 01:29:59.940
<v Speaker 5>it's going to get to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not going to be,</v>

2082
01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 5>the deception is going to be impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what it is.</v>

2083
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.340
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cable News is deceiving everyone we</v>

2084
01:30:05.341 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're deceiving everyone.</v>

2085
01:30:06.691 --> 01:30:08.880
<v Speaker 5>They're sleeping with the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're supposed to be taken care of.</v>

2086
01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 5>All you know what you're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching.</v>

2087
01:30:10.291 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now we're exposing it.</v>

2088
01:30:12.571 --> 01:30:13.920
<v Speaker 5>So think about just what we've done</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

2089
01:30:13.921 --> 01:30:16.920
<v Speaker 5>whether if we got one decent point and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the in the however long we've been</v>

2090
01:30:16.921 --> 01:30:19.590
<v Speaker 5>sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we got one thing out 15 years ago,</v>

2091
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 5>you could not do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could not have two people fully</v>

2092
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 5>unfiltered for this amount of time doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're doing.</v>

2093
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.270
<v Speaker 5>So if we manage one cogent point in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole thing,</v>

2094
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:33.150
<v Speaker 5>that's more than you could have got out</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 years ago.</v>

2095
01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:34.710
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely more than you're ever</v>

2096
01:30:34.711 --> 01:30:39.090
<v Speaker 5>going to see on networks because</v>
<v Speaker 5>networks have an obligation and they</v>

2097
01:30:39.091 --> 01:30:41.580
<v Speaker 5>have an agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was going back and forth and I</v>

2098
01:30:41.581 --> 01:30:44.070
<v Speaker 5>tweeted about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was going back and forth between</v>

2099
01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:47.670
<v Speaker 5>Fox News and CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One night I just sat in front of the TV.</v>

2100
01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:51.390
<v Speaker 5>My wife and kids were out and so I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>just sitting in front of the TV.</v>

2101
01:30:51.391 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Stone is fuck flipping through the</v>
<v Speaker 5>channels going back and forth between</v>

2102
01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:57.250
<v Speaker 5>CNN and Fox and I was Goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 5>bewildered.</v>

2103
01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:59.100
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching two different worlds,</v>

2104
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.320
<v Speaker 5>two different plants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's two different parallel</v>

2105
01:31:01.321 --> 01:31:04.860
<v Speaker 5>universes in a one parallel universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hillary Clinton is,</v>

2106
01:31:04.861 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the savior of the world and the other</v>

2107
01:31:06.811 --> 01:31:08.790
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a monster and Bill Clinton is a</v>

2108
01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:13.260
<v Speaker 5>rapist and a sexual Predator and these</v>
<v Speaker 5>women are a bunch of Bimbos or just came</v>

2109
01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:17.900
<v Speaker 5>out against Donald Trump and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 5>puppets and Gloria all reds in on it and</v>

2110
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 5>all this craziness.</v>

2111
01:31:19.290 --> 01:31:20.190
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2112
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:23.070
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would a person think if they had,</v>

2113
01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 5>this is their first exposure to human</v>
<v Speaker 5>beings.</v>

2114
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:28.680
<v Speaker 5>If an alien came here from another</v>
<v Speaker 5>planet and there's first exposure to</v>

2115
01:31:28.681 --> 01:31:33.681
<v Speaker 5>human beings was looking at this process</v>
<v Speaker 5>to decide who controls the button,</v>

2116
01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:38.940
<v Speaker 5>then that has all the nuclear weapons of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world pointed at various countries.</v>

2117
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:42.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is insanity and this is an insane</v>

2118
01:31:42.391 --> 01:31:44.700
<v Speaker 5>way to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how do,</v>

2119
01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:49.110
<v Speaker 5>how do we then as as the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the neos of this,</v>

2120
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 5>of this matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2121
01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:53.160
<v Speaker 5>How do we then keep emboldening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2122
01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:54.850
<v Speaker 5>I guess we just have to keep doing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the building.</v>

2123
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.320
<v Speaker 5>There's an inevitable process going on</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

2124
01:31:57.321 --> 01:31:59.870
<v Speaker 5>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

2125
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 3>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to overwhelm what we consider</v>

2126
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:07.960
<v Speaker 3>to be normal communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to overwhelm that and right</v>

2127
01:32:07.961 --> 01:32:12.670
<v Speaker 3>now I think we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're at a very early stage of this</v>

2128
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.490
<v Speaker 3>technological progression and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at,</v>

2129
01:32:15.491 --> 01:32:18.790
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the Internet and devices and</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones and laptops and shit,</v>

2130
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.500
<v Speaker 3>but I think new technology is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>emerge that's going to foot look.</v>

2131
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 3>No one would have ever thought that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have people addicted to a phone.</v>

2132
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Just 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one would've ever even considered the</v>

2133
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 3>idea of being addicted to a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would go to a restaurant and</v>

2134
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:37.990
<v Speaker 3>80% of the people would just be on their</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and no one likes it when you bring</v>

2135
01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 3>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you say to them,</v>

2136
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to get off your phone?</v>

2137
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck dude,</v>

2138
01:32:41.981 --> 01:32:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I got important emails coming through.</v>

2139
01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Everybody gets mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2140
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like saying,</v>

2141
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:47.560
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you really need that drink?</v>

2142
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I fuck him off that track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same goddamn feeling.</v>

2143
01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 3>People were responding to an addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is just step one man.</v>

2144
01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:58.180
<v Speaker 3>This is step one of an ultimate complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>invasiveness.</v>

2145
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be some new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a neural implant or whether</v>

2146
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Speaker 3>there's some other device that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to wear,</v>

2147
01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:10.510
<v Speaker 3>but there's going to be something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>connects us far more intimately with</v>

2148
01:33:10.511 --> 01:33:12.190
<v Speaker 3>each other than what we're experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2149
01:33:12.191 --> 01:33:13.900
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty God damn intimate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:33:13.901 --> 01:33:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be nice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy who was running for the</v>

2151
01:33:16.931 --> 01:33:20.330
<v Speaker 3>transhumanist party [inaudible].</v>

2152
01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what we talked.</v>

2153
01:33:22.071 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean we spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I'm sure you did,</v>

2154
01:33:23.261 --> 01:33:25.330
<v Speaker 3>we spent the hour basically talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about all that,</v>

2155
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:27.430
<v Speaker 3>that think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about it this look,</v>

2156
01:33:27.431 --> 01:33:29.200
<v Speaker 3>it's not that this shit's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>

2157
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:32.200
<v Speaker 3>but instead of talking about grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy and emails,</v>

2158
01:33:32.201 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 3>we should be talking about some of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2159
01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:39.970
<v Speaker 3>some of these actual things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to shape our lives and we don't</v>

2160
01:33:39.971 --> 01:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>talk about any of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the shit just happens.</v>

2161
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.430
<v Speaker 3>And then instead of talking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>preparing ourselves,</v>

2162
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:48.310
<v Speaker 3>we react.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we need to do a little legwork so</v>

2163
01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>that when this stuff comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

2164
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 3>we have to be ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't.</v>

2165
01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:55.150
<v Speaker 3>So one day the robots will be here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be bound down to him</v>

2166
01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:57.170
<v Speaker 3>because we didn't do the Legwork to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

2167
01:33:57.171 --> 01:33:58.390
<v Speaker 3>you know what they were gonna turn on</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2168
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:59.340
<v Speaker 3>We should have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2169
01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily know if the robots</v>

2170
01:34:02.171 --> 01:34:04.720
<v Speaker 3>are gonna turn on us like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big concern that a lot of</v>

2171
01:34:04.721 --> 01:34:06.820
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk,</v>

2172
01:34:06.821 --> 01:34:10.000
<v Speaker 3>the artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think before then we're going to</v>

2173
01:34:10.001 --> 01:34:10.781
<v Speaker 3>integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2174
01:34:10.781 --> 01:34:14.320
<v Speaker 3>I think before virtual reality you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have augmented reality and I</v>

2175
01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:17.980
<v Speaker 3>think that augmented human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings that are augmented with</v>

2176
01:34:17.981 --> 01:34:20.460
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really going to be what's going</v>

2177
01:34:20.461 --> 01:34:24.700
<v Speaker 3>to separate us from what we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially the monkey holding</v>

2178
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:26.800
<v Speaker 3>the device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the device is going to be in the</v>

2179
01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 3>monk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at all ten's got the chip in</v>

2180
01:34:28.721 --> 01:34:31.580
<v Speaker 3>him and he can open his garage door and</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength and he's,</v>

2181
01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:32.940
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2182
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:36.190
<v Speaker 3>he knows a guy that wants to chop his</v>
<v Speaker 3>arm off to get the bionic arm to be</v>

2183
01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:36.671
<v Speaker 3>able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2184
01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:39.490
<v Speaker 3>and get Wifi in your arm and Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2185
01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:42.040
<v Speaker 3>And then somebody hacks into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians are going to hack his arm.</v>

2186
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:46.470
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna jerk his own dick off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leaders going to do with this robotic.</v>

2187
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2188
01:34:47.651 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 3>You think we're in shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should go into stand up.</v>

2189
01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying that for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good public speaker.</v>

2190
01:34:52.321 --> 01:34:54.370
<v Speaker 3>He's obviously fucked off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got all the traits,</v>

2191
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got everything going on.</v>

2192
01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 3>They get them in stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's</v>

2193
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.650
<v Speaker 2>probably pretty fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks,</v>

2194
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 2>he looks funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.260
<v Speaker 2>He's a great face for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:07.880
<v Speaker 2>The wrong line of business politics are</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially show business for ugly</v>

2197
01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what sounds comedy,</v>

2198
01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

2199
01:35:11.150 --> 01:35:14.540
<v Speaker 2>you knows there's been some really not</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good looking people that have done</v>

2200
01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:15.890
<v Speaker 2>a wonderful job of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2201
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.880
<v Speaker 2>telling jokes and becoming famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we look pretty good relative,</v>

2202
01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:19.930
<v Speaker 2>relative Max.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been doing stand up much in</v>

2204
01:35:21.501 --> 01:35:23.600
<v Speaker 2>the last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think relatively speaking,</v>

2205
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.990
<v Speaker 2>we gotta be on the higher end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking.</v>

2206
01:35:25.991 --> 01:35:28.640
<v Speaker 2>And tosh is probably number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that handsome bastard bastard.</v>

2207
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful Hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck beautiful man.</v>

2208
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.630
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of them like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sebastian,</v>

2209
01:35:32.631 --> 01:35:35.780
<v Speaker 2>he's a good looking goddamn guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a few,</v>

2210
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 2>but now more so than ever in the past</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was happened to the fat slob and</v>

2211
01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Lee comedian I would know.</v>

2212
01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:45.760
<v Speaker 2>But I'm talking to Lucy Kay embraces it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lou Anderson,</v>

2213
01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.560
<v Speaker 2>and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was happy that he wanted that.</v>

2214
01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That he won the Ralphie May,</v>

2215
01:35:49.891 --> 01:35:50.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Ralphie may takes us to the whole new</v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

2217
01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like a Bruce Lee of,</v>

2218
01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

2219
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Something you wouldn't say in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2220
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.923
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2221
01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:05.960
<v Speaker 2>he knows what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not the worst thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2223
01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 2>well whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2224
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I honestly believe that we're at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tipping point in,</v>

2225
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:16.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in human civilization.</v>

2226
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what this election is</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposing is how ridiculous our processes</v>

2227
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 2>that our process was created by people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who used to write with feathers.</v>

2228
01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:24.681
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2229
01:36:24.681 --> 01:36:27.110
<v Speaker 2>it really was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was created by people who rode horses</v>

2230
01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:30.350
<v Speaker 2>to get around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they needed a representative government</v>

2231
01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 2>cause there was no fucking way are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be able to talk to someone in</v>

2232
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2233
01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.270
<v Speaker 2>It would take forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they needed someone to talk to</v>

2234
01:36:35.271 --> 01:36:37.340
<v Speaker 2>those people and then get the word back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Washington.</v>

2235
01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.920
<v Speaker 2>We don't need that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an archaic system.</v>

2236
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:42.980
<v Speaker 2>And then an archaic system is in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways being exposed.</v>

2237
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a tweet recently or an instagram</v>

2238
01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:47.390
<v Speaker 2>post about this guy that was going over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the electoral map,</v>

2239
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:50.210
<v Speaker 2>like a storm was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like [inaudible] and all the</v>

2240
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:51.500
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2241
01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:54.220
<v Speaker 2>this guy is like talking about storms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about,</v>

2242
01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 2>he's doing a forecast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is so bizarre what we're</v>

2243
01:36:58.191 --> 01:36:59.160
<v Speaker 2>seeing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're,</v>

2244
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:01.280
<v Speaker 2>you're so right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just on the technology front and</v>

2245
01:37:01.281 --> 01:37:03.620
<v Speaker 2>how we vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like every state has two senators.</v>

2246
01:37:03.621 --> 01:37:07.340
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they did it back then was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they wanted to make sure that</v>

2247
01:37:07.341 --> 01:37:10.220
<v Speaker 2>the states like Montana that have nobody</v>
<v Speaker 2>living there had some sort of</v>

2248
01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:11.270
<v Speaker 2>representations.</v>

2249
01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.210
<v Speaker 2>So they needed to make sure that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>train with the president campaigning</v>

2250
01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:16.820
<v Speaker 2>would actually make it there or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse and buggy or whatever it was.</v>

2251
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And it's like now it's all changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything being equal,</v>

2252
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.690
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm not for changing a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2253
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wouldn't be for changing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

2254
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 2>but like the fact that Montana has two</v>
<v Speaker 2>senators and California has two</v>

2255
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:31.710
<v Speaker 2>senators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California has like that.</v>

2256
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:33.770
<v Speaker 2>What is it like the 10th biggest economy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world?</v>

2257
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

2258
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:36.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

2259
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.161
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2260
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:39.620
<v Speaker 2>technology has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not necessary anymore.</v>

2261
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 2>The people in Montana can hear all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same shit that the people in California</v>

2262
01:37:43.131 --> 01:37:45.200
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are things that are happening</v>

2263
01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:48.980
<v Speaker 2>now that the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so ingrained and because</v>

2264
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:51.260
<v Speaker 2>the people that control it and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

2265
01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that's a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just the way things work.</v>

2266
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:55.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so grained.</v>

2267
01:37:55.690 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what</v>

2268
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v Speaker 5>we love about the constitution has</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially already been violated by the</v>

2269
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:03.750
<v Speaker 5>Patriot Act,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Patriot Act to the NDA.</v>

2270
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of weird shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>already in place that kind of takes away</v>

2271
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:11.430
<v Speaker 5>from the things that the founding</v>
<v Speaker 5>fathers had set up to make sure that</v>

2272
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.330
<v Speaker 5>tyranny was never embraced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That we,</v>

2273
01:38:14.331 --> 01:38:15.031
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2274
01:38:15.031 --> 01:38:20.031
<v Speaker 5>we have these things that we established</v>
<v Speaker 5>a long time ago that we think of when we</v>

2275
01:38:21.691 --> 01:38:23.760
<v Speaker 5>think of what the United States is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freedom of speech,</v>

2276
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:25.350
<v Speaker 5>freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2277
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.530
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a right to a fair trial when</v>

2278
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:31.620
<v Speaker 5>you don't anymore with the Patriot Act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And with indefinite detention that was</v>

2279
01:38:31.621 --> 01:38:34.800
<v Speaker 5>provided by the NDA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could kind of put you in jail for</v>

2280
01:38:34.801 --> 01:38:36.960
<v Speaker 5>whatever they decide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put you in jail because you</v>

2281
01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:41.430
<v Speaker 5>represent a threat or that you are on a</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrorist watch list or whatever.</v>

2282
01:38:41.431 --> 01:38:43.410
<v Speaker 5>And if they decide that you're a threat</v>
<v Speaker 5>to America,</v>

2283
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:45.570
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really don't have the right to a</v>

2284
01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:47.220
<v Speaker 5>trial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can just lock you up.</v>

2285
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at what the fuck they did to</v>

2286
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Chelsea manning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2287
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:52.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to this day she just tried to commit</v>

2288
01:38:52.801 --> 01:38:54.780
<v Speaker 5>suicide again apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2289
01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:56.520
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole,</v>

2290
01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:00.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean not to me disturbs me almost as</v>
<v Speaker 5>much as anything.</v>

2291
01:39:00.121 --> 01:39:05.121
<v Speaker 5>The Way Julian assange just like trapped</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a house in London and can't leave.</v>

2292
01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 5>He's in an embassy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what does that tell you then about</v>

2293
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:10.200
<v Speaker 5>the progressive's that we're all about</v>
<v Speaker 5>this right?</v>

2294
01:39:10.201 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 5>They were all about Chelsea manning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were all about getting all the</v>

2295
01:39:12.931 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 5>information when it was all breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was completely with them.</v>

2296
01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.021
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm all,</v>

2297
01:39:16.021 --> 01:39:16.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like look,</v>

2298
01:39:16.831 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 5>I believe that governments should be</v>
<v Speaker 5>transparent,</v>

2299
01:39:19.231 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 5>but there is some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you with me on this?</v>

2300
01:39:21.271 --> 01:39:24.120
<v Speaker 5>That some shit has to go down that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't know of.</v>

2301
01:39:24.121 --> 01:39:24.871
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2302
01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's when people want</v>

2303
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 5>everything to be fully transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like put it,</v>

2304
01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:34.260
<v Speaker 5>the problem is who gets to keep those</v>
<v Speaker 5>secrets and why the regular folks as a</v>

2305
01:39:34.261 --> 01:39:37.140
<v Speaker 5>regular person get to keep those secrets</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the American people?</v>

2306
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:39.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

2307
01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:42.840
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno what the right answer to that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>other than there has to be,</v>

2308
01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:45.450
<v Speaker 5>you can't have everyone walking around</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all the knowledge.</v>

2309
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 5>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think someday that's going to be</v>

2310
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:49.920
<v Speaker 5>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying about technology</v>

2311
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:51.870
<v Speaker 5>that eventually it'll just unfurl the</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole thing.</v>

2312
01:39:51.871 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 5>It's a bottleneck is there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I also think the bottleneck is going</v>

2313
01:39:55.441 --> 01:39:59.370
<v Speaker 5>to occur with money because I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>money right now is really just numbers</v>

2314
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.270
<v Speaker 5>mean money isn't backed by gold anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just numbers.</v>

2315
01:40:03.271 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 5>It's just numbers on a well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that means it's data.</v>

2316
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:09.540
<v Speaker 5>So that means it's information and</v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

2317
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.830
<v Speaker 5>It's going in the direction that</v>
<v Speaker 5>information is eventually going to be</v>

2318
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:16.170
<v Speaker 5>completely transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna be able to share</v>

2319
01:40:16.171 --> 01:40:19.200
<v Speaker 5>information back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if we're going to be able</v>

2320
01:40:19.201 --> 01:40:22.470
<v Speaker 5>to hold onto this concept of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the concept of money that we</v>

2321
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:26.730
<v Speaker 5>have in our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's connected to civilization and that</v>

2322
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.520
<v Speaker 5>in itself is only a few thousand years</v>
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>

2323
01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:32.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you look at the invention of</v>
<v Speaker 5>money before that,</v>

2324
01:40:32.551 --> 01:40:35.310
<v Speaker 5>it was sort of like trading in goods and</v>
<v Speaker 5>services or whatever it was.</v>

2325
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.950
<v Speaker 5>You're going back what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20,000 years,</v>

2326
01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:39.990
<v Speaker 5>30,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human beings have been around for a long</v>

2327
01:40:39.991 --> 01:40:42.540
<v Speaker 5>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Culture's been around for a long time.</v>

2328
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:47.570
<v Speaker 5>I thought like 10,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human beings in this current state are</v>

2329
01:40:47.971 --> 01:40:51.750
<v Speaker 5>incredibly recent where we're not even</v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with gold anymore.</v>

2330
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 5>Now we're just dealing with numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the</v>

2331
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.010
<v Speaker 3>next step is that you can't keep track</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that anymore.</v>

2332
01:40:57.190 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 3>The next step is going to be a resource</v>
<v Speaker 3>based economy,</v>

2333
01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.420
<v Speaker 3>meaning that people are just going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing and trading and resources and</v>

2334
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:07.630
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to figure out some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to quantify those resources and</v>

2335
01:41:07.631 --> 01:41:11.620
<v Speaker 3>quantify your value and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be the way it is now where</v>

2336
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 3>you have these hedge fund managers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these Bernie Madoff twats that are</v>

2337
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:20.191
<v Speaker 3>fucking just essentially moving numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and making ungodly sums of money.</v>

2338
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:22.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the Hamptons,</v>

2339
01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.380
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those fucking people that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>these castles out there and then in the</v>

2340
01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:30.250
<v Speaker 3>castles in Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have these people that have just</v>

2341
01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:31.830
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way to move numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

2342
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:34.480
<v Speaker 3>That's all they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're moving playing tricks with the</v>

2343
01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 3>system basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2344
01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:37.840
<v Speaker 3>They're extracting money from a broken</v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

2345
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I think that,</v>

2346
01:41:38.771 --> 01:41:40.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when people come after trump on the</v>

2347
01:41:40.721 --> 01:41:43.750
<v Speaker 3>money stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the whole thing with the $918</v>

2348
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:44.930
<v Speaker 3>million in the write off and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2349
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>

2350
01:41:45.851 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 3>We haven't seen his taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made it the election tomorrow.</v>

2351
01:41:48.401 --> 01:41:51.700
<v Speaker 3>He made it without John's talk city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do that because again,</v>

2352
01:41:51.701 --> 01:41:54.040
<v Speaker 3>it's just trolling the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you remember when,</v>

2353
01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 3>when Howard stern was running for</v>
<v Speaker 3>governor and they were forcing him to</v>

2354
01:41:57.191 --> 01:41:58.900
<v Speaker 3>reveal his taxes and he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

2355
01:41:58.901 --> 01:42:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2356
01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that what happened to drop?</v>

2357
01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 3>Basically?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard's a very wise guy.</v>

2358
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:06.850
<v Speaker 3>So I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that he knew that was</v>

2359
01:42:06.851 --> 01:42:09.010
<v Speaker 3>going to happen and didn't really want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be governor anyway,</v>

2360
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:11.680
<v Speaker 3>but when he was running for governor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the heart.</v>

2361
01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 3>That was a hurdle that they told him he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to expose his taxes to Howard's</v>

2362
01:42:15.881 --> 01:42:16.150
<v Speaker 3>credit.</v>

2363
01:42:16.150 --> 01:42:16.841
<v Speaker 3>And I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

2364
01:42:16.841 --> 01:42:18.280
<v Speaker 3>love Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2365
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:20.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see a couple of weeks ago they</v>

2366
01:42:20.441 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were asking him to release all</v>

2367
01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:24.940
<v Speaker 3>the trump interviews from all the years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the 20 years,</v>

2368
01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:25.751
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2369
01:42:25.751 --> 01:42:29.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when people came and come to my</v>

2370
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:30.880
<v Speaker 3>studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2371
01:42:30.881 --> 01:42:33.710
<v Speaker 3>we're playing a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of we're talking about women were,</v>

2372
01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.500
<v Speaker 3>and it would add nothing to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2373
01:42:36.501 --> 01:42:38.350
<v Speaker 3>and Donald Trump is a good sport about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2374
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:41.170
<v Speaker 3>So for me to betray that it would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>betraying my own self.</v>

2375
01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a pretty great</v>
<v Speaker 3>principled statement by him.</v>

2376
01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:47.140
<v Speaker 3>That is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also taking it out of context,</v>

2377
01:42:47.141 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 3>the context of being on the stern show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but didn't do,</v>

2378
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:51.030
<v Speaker 3>they did use some of the stuff that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2379
01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:54.640
<v Speaker 3>so they got supporting the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think somebody else had that video.</v>

2380
01:42:54.641 --> 01:42:58.780
<v Speaker 3>But I guess there's apparently archive</v>
<v Speaker 3>full of stuff that I guess he owns or,</v>

2381
01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2382
01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is of,</v>

2383
01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a time and a place for things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also,</v>

2384
01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:09.460
<v Speaker 3>you have to think that this guy was not</v>
<v Speaker 3>running for president back when he was</v>

2385
01:43:09.461 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 3>saying those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just being a silly man on a silly</v>

2386
01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:15.700
<v Speaker 3>show where it's all about humor and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2387
01:43:15.701 --> 01:43:18.550
<v Speaker 3>being a good sport and playing a role as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard put it.</v>

2388
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're paraphrasing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's,</v>

2389
01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:22.620
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2390
01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.520
<v Speaker 3>so he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2391
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:24.730
<v Speaker 3>he was playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was,</v>

2392
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:25.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2393
01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:28.090
<v Speaker 3>he would've had an opportunity to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>him in the mix again.</v>

2394
01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:28.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>may,</v>

2395
01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more publicity for him.</v>

2396
01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:30.430
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2397
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:32.740
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what the purpose of what I've</v>

2398
01:43:32.741 --> 01:43:36.280
<v Speaker 3>built here for the last 40 years is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to throw in on this</v>

2399
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 3>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought it was pretty good.</v>

2400
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:39.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2401
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:44.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he probably realizes that if he</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever decided to run for government in</v>

2402
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:46.450
<v Speaker 3>the form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the same thing would be used against</v>

2403
01:43:46.451 --> 01:43:48.200
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what does that say about an std?</v>

2404
01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Not Him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know who he is,</v>

2405
01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:53.690
<v Speaker 3>is you ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are your well considered opinions</v>

2406
01:43:53.691 --> 01:43:55.520
<v Speaker 3>on things right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2407
01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:58.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woe in 1989 you've said,</v>

2408
01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:01.380
<v Speaker 3>you know that this person's a monkey and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2409
01:44:01.381 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 3>and like think how fucking dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>

2410
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 3>So from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the limited amount that I know you,</v>

2411
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you seem to me to be an extremely</v>

2412
01:44:09.981 --> 01:44:12.080
<v Speaker 3>principled person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a code that you live by,</v>

2413
01:44:12.081 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you care about honesty and being</v>

2414
01:44:14.451 --> 01:44:16.280
<v Speaker 3>forthright and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of that stuff,</v>

2415
01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:18.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of all the things that you've said</v>

2416
01:44:18.081 --> 01:44:19.960
<v Speaker 3>here about doing drugs or sex or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2417
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:20.481
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2418
01:44:20.481 --> 01:44:20.960
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2419
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Someone like you would never want to run</v>
<v Speaker 3>for president ever.</v>

2420
01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.060
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you even possibly fathom running five</v>

2421
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.390
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't want the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I did,</v>

2422
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:30.970
<v Speaker 3>if I did run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2423
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I did,</v>

2424
01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:33.780
<v Speaker 3>they would definitely use all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

2425
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:36.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's why context is so incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

2426
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:40.070
<v Speaker 3>And this is also an incredibly new thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with human beings.</v>

2427
01:44:40.071 --> 01:44:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Being able to extract little soundbites</v>
<v Speaker 3>from things that you've said and whether</v>

2428
01:44:44.301 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 3>it's a tweet from justine sacco or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2429
01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 3>And then say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this defines you this moment.</v>

2430
01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:53.210
<v Speaker 3>This one moment defines you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one moment where someone cuts you</v>

2431
01:44:53.211 --> 01:44:55.370
<v Speaker 3>off and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking cunt,</v>

2432
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:59.510
<v Speaker 3>and you lay on your horn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Dave Rubin that you want Dave</v>

2433
01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Ruben running your country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if that was your mom that cutoff?</v>

2434
01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Dave Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if that woman was headed to the</v>

2435
01:45:05.151 --> 01:45:05.984
<v Speaker 3>hospital?</v>

2436
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:09.910
<v Speaker 3>What if her baby was dying in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>backseat and Dave Ruben called her con?</v>

2437
01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2438
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to,</v>

2439
01:45:14.871 --> 01:45:16.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm just throwing little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>

2440
01:45:16.731 --> 01:45:17.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2441
01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I just think that that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem that you can't think</v>

2442
01:45:21.731 --> 01:45:23.000
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even I'm not,</v>

2443
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:26.210
<v Speaker 3>all I'm doing right now is saying what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think as it comes out of my brain,</v>

2444
01:45:26.211 --> 01:45:27.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not freaking me out.</v>

2445
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2446
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:28.461
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's wild.</v>

2447
01:45:28.461 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 3>But it's all freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's all we're doing here.</v>

2448
01:45:30.531 --> 01:45:33.290
<v Speaker 3>But anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone that doesn't like us or wanted to</v>

2449
01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:36.380
<v Speaker 3>discredit us or anything and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to bring it back to Sam again,</v>

2450
01:45:36.381 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the types of things that people with</v>

2451
01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:42.630
<v Speaker 3>really awful intentions have done with</v>
<v Speaker 3>misquoting him and all that stuff and</v>

2452
01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:47.770
<v Speaker 3>that thing needs to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That outrage monster that we'll find one</v>

2453
01:45:48.441 --> 01:45:53.000
<v Speaker 3>thing that you did or said once to then</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy every other piece of goodness</v>

2454
01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:55.130
<v Speaker 3>that you've put out there must end.</v>

2455
01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:57.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a big piece of what's happening</v>

2456
01:45:57.021 --> 01:45:59.090
<v Speaker 3>here too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think discourse in particular</v>

2457
01:45:59.091 --> 01:46:02.750
<v Speaker 3>like discourse against Sam is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what a lot of people are doing.</v>

2458
01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 3>They're playing a game and Sam has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>high profile and they're using their</v>

2459
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:09.950
<v Speaker 3>voice to attack that high profile to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a move on the castle.</v>

2460
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're moving chess pieces</v>

2461
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:14.150
<v Speaker 3>around and they're using strategy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying,</v>

2462
01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:15.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said this about Islam,</v>

2463
01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do you understand how many billions</v>

2464
01:46:18.081 --> 01:46:22.010
<v Speaker 3>of people or a peaceful Muslims and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive this is to say that they,</v>

2465
01:46:22.011 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's what they're doing</v>

2466
01:46:23.361 --> 01:46:25.490
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're taking these positions and</v>

2467
01:46:25.491 --> 01:46:29.390
<v Speaker 3>they're also taking these positions in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird way because there's something</v>

2468
01:46:29.391 --> 01:46:33.320
<v Speaker 3>about writing a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very cowardly thing when you're</v>

2469
01:46:33.321 --> 01:46:35.510
<v Speaker 3>attacking someone because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>respond.</v>

2470
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:36.860
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2471
01:46:36.861 --> 01:46:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you want someone to respond back in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>blog,</v>

2472
01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 3>you're requiring an incredible amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their time sitting there and formulate</v>

2473
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:44.210
<v Speaker 3>another blog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you know that,</v>

2474
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:47.480
<v Speaker 3>that it's a one way dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if someone writes an attack blog on</v>

2475
01:46:47.481 --> 01:46:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Dave Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2476
01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very cowardly</v>

2477
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:54.240
<v Speaker 5>thing because what they're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're sort of forcing you to respond</v>

2478
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:59.420
<v Speaker 5>by establishing a false narrative are by</v>
<v Speaker 5>portraying you in an unfavorable light</v>

2479
01:47:00.061 --> 01:47:02.490
<v Speaker 5>by taking things out of context and</v>
<v Speaker 5>using them.</v>

2480
01:47:02.491 --> 01:47:04.080
<v Speaker 5>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do people do it against me.</v>

2481
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.250
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost,</v>

2482
01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 5>it's funny when you read,</v>

2483
01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.191
<v Speaker 4>you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2484
01:47:07.191 --> 01:47:08.300
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is weird.</v>

2485
01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Or that someone split,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spent so much thought on extrapolating</v>

2486
01:47:12.141 --> 01:47:14.960
<v Speaker 4>something that you said that you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>either mean or it's like,</v>

2487
01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:17.180
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really went deep on my psyche in a</v>

2488
01:47:17.181 --> 01:47:18.850
<v Speaker 4>way that had nothing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

2489
01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:20.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Guy Mike Cernovich by any chance?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can't smoked the sativa.</v>

01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Really appreciate it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2502
01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

2503
01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:45.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>w from having him on,</v>

2504
01:47:45.711 --> 01:47:48.650
<v Speaker 4>I got more shit than I've had than</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone else that I've had on because you</v>

2505
01:47:48.651 --> 01:47:51.110
<v Speaker 4>had them on because I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was sort of a cause he's</v>

2506
01:47:51.111 --> 01:47:52.670
<v Speaker 4>thought of as part of the alt right.</v>

2507
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:56.900
<v Speaker 4>He apparently he had tweeted like three</v>
<v Speaker 4>years before I had him on the show.</v>

2508
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:59.300
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know who he was until</v>
<v Speaker 4>about two weeks before I had him on.</v>

2509
01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:02.660
<v Speaker 4>But about three years before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had tweeted something that sounded</v>

2510
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:06.710
<v Speaker 4>like he was a rape apologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was either a bad joke or it was a</v>

2511
01:48:06.711 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 4>little unclear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rewarded clumsily or whatever.</v>

2512
01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:10.480
<v Speaker 4>Remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2513
01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.020
<v Speaker 4>it can put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can probably find it pretty quick,</v>

2514
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:13.850
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember exactly what it was.</v>

2515
01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.100
<v Speaker 4>But then suddenly I got all these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2516
01:48:16.110 --> 01:48:19.970
<v Speaker 4>you see Ruben had a rape apologist on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he must hate women or you know,</v>

2517
01:48:19.971 --> 01:48:21.290
<v Speaker 4>something to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2518
01:48:21.291 --> 01:48:24.740
<v Speaker 4>what you guys are doing is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're picking,</v>

2519
01:48:24.741 --> 01:48:27.050
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so should I let you pick who I talked</v>

2520
01:48:27.051 --> 01:48:27.771
<v Speaker 4>to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2521
01:48:27.771 --> 01:48:29.930
<v Speaker 4>and that's like you should have the guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2522
01:48:29.931 --> 01:48:31.400
<v Speaker 4>you'll get a certain amount of hate for</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2523
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:33.650
<v Speaker 4>but you'll have an a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation with him,</v>

2524
01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.880
<v Speaker 4>haven't you had</v>

2525
01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:39.230
<v Speaker 5>people that you've communicated with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you thought were one way and as you</v>

2526
01:48:39.231 --> 01:48:42.200
<v Speaker 5>got to know them better and better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you found out some stuff they had said</v>

2527
01:48:42.201 --> 01:48:43.070
<v Speaker 5>and you might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

2528
01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.470
<v Speaker 5>I'll call it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some things that people say that</v>

2529
01:48:45.471 --> 01:48:50.471
<v Speaker 5>is just absolutely are inarguable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

2530
01:48:51.230 --> 01:48:52.580
<v Speaker 5>you can't support it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2531
01:48:52.581 --> 01:48:54.110
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain things that people have</v>

2532
01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:55.640
<v Speaker 5>said that inexcusable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2533
01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.580
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>

2534
01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:00.890
<v Speaker 5>you might come across those two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I could see the point of taking some</v>

2535
01:49:00.891 --> 01:49:04.850
<v Speaker 5>things and maybe they might be even out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of context and using that to sort of</v>

2536
01:49:04.851 --> 01:49:07.460
<v Speaker 5>like say at the very least consider</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2537
01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as an,</v>

2538
01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:10.450
<v Speaker 4>as an interviewer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

2539
01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.030
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you or I are not held to.</v>

2540
01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:18.780
<v Speaker 4>If we had to basically vet every person</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we ever sat down with for every</v>

2541
01:49:18.821 --> 01:49:20.920
<v Speaker 4>thought that they had three years ago on</v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>

2542
01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:23.230
<v Speaker 4>we would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a pretty Brooke and lonely life.</v>

2543
01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm out some pretty offensive people on</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2544
01:49:25.691 --> 01:49:27.430
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten a lot of shit for the Milo</v>
<v Speaker 4>interviews.</v>

2545
01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten a lot of shift for some</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people that have so do you,</v>

2546
01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:30.530
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Milo,</v>

2547
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I really like my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had him over for dinner.</v>

2548
01:49:32.621 --> 01:49:34.780
<v Speaker 4>I've gone out with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a good guy.</v>

2549
01:49:34.781 --> 01:49:37.420
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he say shit that I would not say it's</v>

2550
01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:39.310
<v Speaker 4>working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're talking about a much</v>

2551
01:49:39.311 --> 01:49:40.144
<v Speaker 4>like trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:42.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's why trump has done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2553
01:49:42.071 --> 01:49:43.690
<v Speaker 4>And then when they ban Milo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>

2554
01:49:43.690 --> 01:49:45.270
<v Speaker 4>You make him stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The strategy effect.</v>

2555
01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:46.900
<v Speaker 4>You make him stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spoke,</v>

2556
01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I did a speech at a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at Ucla with Milo were just a little</v>

2557
01:49:50.981 --> 01:49:53.920
<v Speaker 4>back and forth chat thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had all of these kids out.</v>

2558
01:49:53.921 --> 01:49:55.930
<v Speaker 4>So first of all there were hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids trying to get in.</v>

2559
01:49:55.931 --> 01:49:59.660
<v Speaker 4>But then there was this loud 200 kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to literally block people.</v>

2560
01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 4>So they're not against walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

2561
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:02.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't like trump's wall,</v>

2562
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:04.480
<v Speaker 4>but they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But blocking a wall for other people to</v>

2563
01:50:04.481 --> 01:50:07.780
<v Speaker 4>exercise their free speech and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>dumping garbage cans and spitting on</v>

2564
01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 4>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting in cops faces with cameras,</v>

2565
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:13.300
<v Speaker 4>like just begging them to just flip in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>

2566
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.280
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this great chat.</v>

2567
01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really funny actually,</v>

2568
01:50:17.321 --> 01:50:20.080
<v Speaker 4>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl in the audience,</v>

2569
01:50:20.110 --> 01:50:22.300
<v Speaker 4>she just busted about halfway through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>starts screaming.</v>

2570
01:50:22.301 --> 01:50:23.260
<v Speaker 4>She got an a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2571
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.820
<v Speaker 4>people weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know she was a protestor.</v>

2572
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.230
<v Speaker 4>She gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she starts screaming,</v>

2573
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:27.750
<v Speaker 4>I hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate you,</v>

2574
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:30.220
<v Speaker 4>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I stopped and I said,</v>

2575
01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.560
<v Speaker 4>I bet you actually we were going to do a</v>
<v Speaker 4>q and a at the end,</v>

2576
01:50:32.561 --> 01:50:35.530
<v Speaker 4>but I bet you right now if you ask my</v>
<v Speaker 4>little one question that you really have</v>

2577
01:50:35.531 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 4>burning or make one point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you he'll respond to you.</v>

2578
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.820
<v Speaker 4>So I stopped the show ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

2579
01:50:40.821 --> 01:50:42.800
<v Speaker 4>do you have one point?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the girl</v>

2580
01:50:42.970 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 5>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey yo.</v>

2581
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:45.880
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2582
01:50:45.881 --> 01:50:48.210
<v Speaker 5>she's a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's how stupid these people,</v>

2583
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:52.210
<v Speaker 5>are they stupid or are they just kids?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're talking about these</v>

2584
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:56.230
<v Speaker 5>kids that are protesting and stopping</v>
<v Speaker 5>people from going into lectures or some</v>

2585
01:50:56.231 --> 01:50:58.960
<v Speaker 5>of these crazy feminists that have uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2586
01:50:58.961 --> 01:51:00.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scene from the University of</v>

2587
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:02.350
<v Speaker 5>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very famous thing where they had this</v>

2588
01:51:02.351 --> 01:51:04.120
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they completely misrepresented his</v>

2589
01:51:04.121 --> 01:51:09.121
<v Speaker 5>opinions on things and they had painted</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy out to be anti female and anti</v>

2590
01:51:09.131 --> 01:51:11.920
<v Speaker 5>woman and as some sort of a men's rights</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

2591
01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:14.920
<v Speaker 5>which is a very bizarre thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to deny that men's rights</v>

2592
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:16.720
<v Speaker 5>are applicable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it can't,</v>

2593
01:51:17.110 --> 01:51:19.960
<v Speaker 5>if you can't be a feminist and also</v>
<v Speaker 5>recognize men's rights,</v>

2594
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.190
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

2595
01:51:21.191 --> 01:51:26.191
<v Speaker 5>very bizarre of a thing going on where</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's as much as trying to get back at</v>

2596
01:51:28.361 --> 01:51:31.360
<v Speaker 5>the perceived winners of the world when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel like you've been a loser of the</v>

2597
01:51:31.361 --> 01:51:31.870
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

2598
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:34.900
<v Speaker 5>That's where I think white privilege is</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming from and a lot of this stuff,</v>

2599
01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:39.580
<v Speaker 5>not to deny that white people have it</v>
<v Speaker 5>easier than black people in terms of</v>

2600
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:42.400
<v Speaker 5>dealing with racism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't mean that those white</v>

2601
01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:44.410
<v Speaker 5>people are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of white people that are</v>

2602
01:51:44.411 --> 01:51:45.790
<v Speaker 5>your allies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>

2603
01:51:45.791 --> 01:51:47.380
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real problem is the racist</v>

2604
01:51:47.381 --> 01:51:49.990
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not people who aren't victim of the</v>

2605
01:51:49.991 --> 01:51:53.170
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like saying that these people are</v>

2606
01:51:53.171 --> 01:51:54.070
<v Speaker 5>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2607
01:51:54.071 --> 01:51:56.860
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But painting it this some sort of a way</v>

2608
01:51:57.130 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 5>like where these privileged people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're assholes for for allowing this</v>

2609
01:52:02.111 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 5>privilege to even take place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the problem is always singular.</v>

2610
01:52:06.230 --> 01:52:09.560
<v Speaker 5>The problem is racism itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the racist themselves,</v>

2611
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 5>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that people aren't victim of the</v>

2612
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:14.110
<v Speaker 5>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the collective and this is what the</v>

2613
01:52:14.111 --> 01:52:17.700
<v Speaker 5>left is doing that is literally</v>
<v Speaker 5>destroying culture and it destroyed.</v>

2614
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:21.610
<v Speaker 5>We've man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to pull back just</v>

2615
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:24.190
<v Speaker 5>like waves always do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's cycles to things.</v>

2616
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:27.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that's why we went from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the 60 to the seventies in the 70s to</v>

2617
01:52:27.851 --> 01:52:29.920
<v Speaker 5>the 80s I mean I think this is what I</v>
<v Speaker 5>mean.</v>

2618
01:52:29.921 --> 01:52:34.921
<v Speaker 5>It also responds to the condemnation of</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychedelic drugs and sweeping schedule.</v>

2619
01:52:34.961 --> 01:52:38.980
<v Speaker 5>One Act that passed in 1970 which was</v>
<v Speaker 5>directly attributable to the Richard</v>

2620
01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.800
<v Speaker 5>Nixon realizing that a lot of what was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on while the people are coming</v>

2621
01:52:41.801 --> 01:52:43.840
<v Speaker 5>after him or part of the psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 5>movement,</v>

2622
01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.820
<v Speaker 5>all these Republicans started like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got to stop this.</v>

2623
01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:49.730
<v Speaker 5>The psychedelic movement will destroy</v>
<v Speaker 5>our culture.</v>

2624
01:52:49.731 --> 01:52:53.570
<v Speaker 5>You go from this gold water republican</v>
<v Speaker 5>era to all the sudden you're dealing</v>

2625
01:52:53.571 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 5>with freaks and hippies and Jimi Hendrix</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Janice Joplin,</v>

2626
01:52:56.481 --> 01:52:59.280
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop the fucking fire.</v>

2627
01:52:59.310 --> 01:53:01.730
<v Speaker 5>They just threw as much water on it as</v>
<v Speaker 5>they could.</v>

2628
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 5>It locked a bunch of people in jail and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they created laws that made marijuana in</v>

2629
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 5>particular and all these other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They demonize them so that they could go</v>

2630
01:53:09.981 --> 01:53:12.770
<v Speaker 5>after the civil rights movement that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that were in charge of it,</v>

2631
01:53:12.771 --> 01:53:16.400
<v Speaker 5>they got them for drugs and so they</v>
<v Speaker 5>would go after all these different anti</v>

2632
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:19.460
<v Speaker 5>war protest movements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would go after them for drugs too.</v>

2633
01:53:19.461 --> 01:53:23.990
<v Speaker 5>And that schedule one classification of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things that weren't dangerous or</v>

2634
01:53:23.991 --> 01:53:28.340
<v Speaker 5>deadly or killing anyone was directly</v>
<v Speaker 5>attributable to a strategy where they</v>

2635
01:53:28.341 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 5>were going after people that opposed the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vietnam war going after people that</v>

2636
01:53:33.141 --> 01:53:36.860
<v Speaker 5>impose the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly lying to them about all sorts of</v>

2637
01:53:36.861 --> 01:53:38.750
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was before they even knew that</v>

2638
01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:42.860
<v Speaker 5>the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The original thing that got us into</v>

2639
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:45.260
<v Speaker 5>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's so many,</v>

2640
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:50.320
<v Speaker 5>there's so much evidence that that this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this way that people behave when they</v>

2641
01:53:52.011 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 5>suppress things that it has.</v>

2642
01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 5>There's a direct response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all.</v>

2643
01:53:55.821 --> 01:53:56.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you attack someone,</v>

2644
01:53:56.931 --> 01:53:58.370
<v Speaker 5>they're wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're damaged,</v>

2645
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:01.520
<v Speaker 5>and then they rise up and they'd go</v>
<v Speaker 5>after that attack.</v>

2646
01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.710
<v Speaker 5>And that's what you're seeing with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>alt right.</v>

2647
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.500
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know if there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't agree with him on a lot of</v>

2648
01:54:06.501 --> 01:54:10.390
<v Speaker 5>things they stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I recognize it almost as if I,</v>

2649
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:11.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm not objective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2650
01:54:11.541 --> 01:54:12.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm a person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a human being.</v>

2651
01:54:12.651 --> 01:54:14.210
<v Speaker 5>Like all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have my own shit.</v>

2652
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:17.180
<v Speaker 5>But if I was outside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to look at it objectively,</v>

2653
01:54:17.181 --> 01:54:17.601
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2654
01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 5>this thing goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it goes like that and it goes</v>

2655
01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:21.260
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a fucking swing.</v>

2656
01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.690
<v Speaker 5>It's like a pendulum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a Yin and a Yang.</v>

2657
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 5>It comes in and it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think one of the things that's</v>

2658
01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:31.430
<v Speaker 5>happening with this alt right movement</v>
<v Speaker 5>and these people that are really super</v>

2659
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:35.120
<v Speaker 5>conservative and the build that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>wall build a fucking wall,</v>

2660
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:39.020
<v Speaker 5>what you're dealing with is a response</v>
<v Speaker 5>to what they perceive to be.</v>

2661
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.270
<v Speaker 5>Too much openness from the Obama</v>
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>

2662
01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 5>This fucking look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama care,</v>

2663
01:54:44.301 --> 01:54:46.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2664
01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:49.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't know enough about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I have friends that are doctors who</v>

2665
01:54:49.311 --> 01:54:50.600
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2666
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:53.050
<v Speaker 5>I got a friend in docker in Texas a and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2667
01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:58.010
<v Speaker 5>and they spit when they talk to you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get red in the face and then they</v>

2668
01:54:58.011 --> 01:54:59.960
<v Speaker 5>have to stand back and take a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2669
01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:03.620
<v Speaker 5>I know people that lost a practice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a chiropractor lost his practice</v>

2670
01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:05.600
<v Speaker 5>because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think there's,</v>

2671
01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:09.410
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people that are upset</v>
<v Speaker 5>at anyone who's the president.</v>

2672
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:12.710
<v Speaker 5>Anyone who's the president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't get fucking shot.</v>

2673
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:14.720
<v Speaker 5>Miss is a joke that I have for my last</v>
<v Speaker 5>special.</v>

2674
01:55:14.721 --> 01:55:16.850
<v Speaker 5>Who Do we like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy and Lincoln.</v>

2675
01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:19.350
<v Speaker 5>That's what you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you didn't get shot in the head.</v>

2676
01:55:19.351 --> 01:55:20.960
<v Speaker 5>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking sell out.</v>

2677
01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.860
<v Speaker 5>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that that is just the natural</v>

2678
01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:27.470
<v Speaker 5>reaction when we always have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's why we go left,</v>

2679
01:55:27.471 --> 01:55:27.951
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Left,</v>

2680
01:55:27.951 --> 01:55:30.260
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a coincidence that we</v>

2681
01:55:30.261 --> 01:55:35.261
<v Speaker 5>go right from George Bush to Bill</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clinton to George W.</v>

2682
01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's a coincidence.</v>

2683
01:55:37.971 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that's a very clear</v>

2684
01:55:39.981 --> 01:55:40.910
<v Speaker 5>response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or The com,</v>

2685
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:42.650
<v Speaker 5>the government's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

2686
01:55:42.651 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 5>now we're this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the people like,</v>

2687
01:55:44.191 --> 01:55:46.380
<v Speaker 5>well that doesn't fucking work either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's try this.</v>

2688
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:49.350
<v Speaker 5>And then they swing back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then what do you make of what's</v>

2689
01:55:49.351 --> 01:55:51.610
<v Speaker 5>happening now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] she's very hockey.</v>

2690
01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.490
<v Speaker 5>So you think it actually is a swing</v>
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>

2691
01:55:53.491 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's two factors here.</v>

2692
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 5>There's the woman factor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is gigantic cause there's a lot of</v>

2693
01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:01.450
<v Speaker 5>women that vote and a lot of men are</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck ups right there.</v>

2694
01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 5>They're probably going to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine that women out vote men,</v>

2695
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I really think they probably do.</v>

2696
01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:07.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just totally guessing.</v>

2697
01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:10.920
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would say that there's a slight</v>

2698
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:14.040
<v Speaker 5>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that maybe it'd be like 46</v>

2699
01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:17.250
<v Speaker 5>54 for women in favor of women that more</v>
<v Speaker 5>women vote.</v>

2700
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:21.330
<v Speaker 5>But I think that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have also is,</v>

2701
01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.420
<v Speaker 5>there's no good choice here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is a very unique situation.</v>

2702
01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:32.480
<v Speaker 5>You have this really strong anti woman</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling that a lot of these gals get</v>

2703
01:56:32.881 --> 01:56:34.500
<v Speaker 5>from Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially now.</v>

2704
01:56:34.501 --> 01:56:35.490
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that.</v>

2705
01:56:35.850 --> 01:56:39.810
<v Speaker 5>There's the the again and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation that he had on that bus,</v>

2706
01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:44.100
<v Speaker 5>I've heard way worse for some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I love and cherish very deeply and</v>

2707
01:56:44.101 --> 01:56:46.920
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to be funny and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying fucked up things that are totally</v>

2708
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:49.440
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He grows and a lot of them are saying it</v>

2709
01:56:49.441 --> 01:56:52.590
<v Speaker 5>because it's just you and me and you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and we'll just talk some shit.</v>

2710
01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:54.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I run a bus.</v>

2711
01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Words are not action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what people need.</v>

2712
01:56:56.821 --> 01:56:58.770
<v Speaker 5>Understand if he died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>

2713
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:01.590
<v Speaker 5>Women voted higher rates than men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might help Clinton in November.</v>

2714
01:57:01.591 --> 01:57:02.490
<v Speaker 5>See what the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2715
01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:06.450
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it doesn't say it has different</v>

2716
01:57:06.451 --> 01:57:08.170
<v Speaker 5>numbers here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2717
01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:10.170
<v Speaker 5>There's not an overall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2718
01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:12.780
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the idea though,</v>

2719
01:57:12.781 --> 01:57:16.110
<v Speaker 5>that words are in action,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not defending the grab them by</v>

2720
01:57:16.111 --> 01:57:16.921
<v Speaker 5>the Pussy and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

2721
01:57:16.921 --> 01:57:18.360
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was sort of saying that he had</v>

2722
01:57:18.361 --> 01:57:19.240
<v Speaker 5>done it in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if,</v>

2723
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:23.610
<v Speaker 5>if there had been evidence that he had</v>
<v Speaker 5>done those actions actually assaulted,</v>

2724
01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.700
<v Speaker 5>which is no evidence unless you know a</v>
<v Speaker 5>women's vaginas not made out of</v>

2725
01:57:26.770 --> 01:57:28.760
<v Speaker 5>playdough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like fingerprints that are</v>

2726
01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 5>permanent forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2727
01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:32.430
<v Speaker 5>so that's fully legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can't prosecute him for just</v>

2728
01:57:32.431 --> 01:57:34.950
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my point is that words he said</v>

2729
01:57:34.951 --> 01:57:36.210
<v Speaker 5>some shit that was gross.</v>

2730
01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:37.740
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it might have been true.</v>

2731
01:57:37.810 --> 01:57:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

2732
01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 5>So words and actions are two different</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2733
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:43.980
<v Speaker 5>Now maybe you can't prove those things</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause yeah,</v>

2734
01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:48.390
<v Speaker 5>they're not made out of play dough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's still until it's provable.</v>

2735
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:51.360
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can get outraged by it.</v>

2736
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:53.460
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see your point with the problem is</v>

2737
01:57:53.461 --> 01:57:57.780
<v Speaker 5>that just relying completely on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>burden of evidence being like physical</v>

2738
01:57:57.781 --> 01:58:00.240
<v Speaker 5>proof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with an act of people</v>

2739
01:58:00.241 --> 01:58:02.250
<v Speaker 5>touching each other's bodies and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2740
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:04.080
<v Speaker 5>there's not a whole lot of proof when it</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes to that.</v>

2741
01:58:04.081 --> 01:58:06.450
<v Speaker 5>So I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then what do you do and where does</v>

2742
01:58:06.451 --> 01:58:09.690
<v Speaker 5>that put us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we know that some people when</v>

2743
01:58:09.691 --> 01:58:12.930
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they give a a rape allegation,</v>

2744
01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:16.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that there's gonna be a lot of</v>

2745
01:58:16.411 --> 01:58:19.510
<v Speaker 5>people that are telling you the absolute</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth as they remember it.</v>

2746
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:22.620
<v Speaker 5>There's also going to be crazy people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that make things up.</v>

2747
01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be some spectrum in</v>
<v Speaker 5>between those two things.</v>

2748
01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Where are you going to have people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>exaggerate situations that I'm sure</v>

2749
01:58:29.011 --> 01:58:31.680
<v Speaker 5>you've had any conversations that you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>had with people that maybe you've had a</v>

2750
01:58:31.681 --> 01:58:34.590
<v Speaker 5>disagreement and they go to someone else</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they completely reframed a</v>

2751
01:58:34.591 --> 01:58:35.990
<v Speaker 5>disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're a piece of shit.</v>

2752
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:39.570
<v Speaker 5>It's a common thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We love to do it and we love to do it</v>

2753
01:58:39.571 --> 01:58:41.650
<v Speaker 5>for all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've been guilty of it and I'm sure</v>

2754
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:45.970
<v Speaker 5>you have and everybody listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing I'm sure as we are learning the</v>

2755
01:58:45.971 --> 01:58:49.720
<v Speaker 5>very complicated game of communication</v>
<v Speaker 5>with human beings and how much is</v>

2756
01:58:49.721 --> 01:58:53.140
<v Speaker 5>involved in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ego and personality conflicts and</v>

2757
01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:56.050
<v Speaker 5>where you are in your life and your own</v>
<v Speaker 5>stresses and frustrations and whenever</v>

2758
01:58:56.051 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 5>the fuck is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever is going on in this big</v>

2759
01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:00.670
<v Speaker 5>struggle that we're all involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2760
01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:05.920
<v Speaker 5>W there's not always a very clear</v>
<v Speaker 5>perception of how events went down.</v>

2761
01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So see you have to take that into</v>

2762
01:59:08.411 --> 01:59:10.610
<v Speaker 5>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You also have to take any consideration</v>

2763
01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:11.860
<v Speaker 5>the fact they might be telling the</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>

2764
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:15.520
<v Speaker 5>We do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not that there's no evidence</v>

2765
01:59:15.610 --> 01:59:18.070
<v Speaker 5>because there's people that are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2766
01:59:18.071 --> 01:59:22.300
<v Speaker 5>it's nothing you can put on a scale and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know how to read minds yet.</v>

2767
01:59:22.301 --> 01:59:24.280
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is if you read minds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2768
01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:26.770
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find some fucking memories of things.</v>

2769
01:59:26.771 --> 01:59:29.480
<v Speaker 5>Then I went back and looked at them</v>
<v Speaker 5>again like a video or something.</v>

2770
01:59:29.481 --> 01:59:30.131
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2771
01:59:30.131 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know when to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2772
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:35.590
<v Speaker 5>we just went over that the other day I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was talking about Tommy hearns versus</v>

2773
01:59:35.591 --> 01:59:36.910
<v Speaker 5>Marvin Hagler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

2774
01:59:36.911 --> 01:59:39.460
<v Speaker 5>one of my all time favorite fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have swore it was a second round</v>

2775
01:59:39.461 --> 01:59:40.170
<v Speaker 5>knockout.</v>

2776
01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:41.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they went to a third round.</v>

2777
01:59:41.590 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 5>Hagwon knocked him out in the third</v>
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>

2778
01:59:42.881 --> 01:59:44.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck did it in my mind,</v>

2779
01:59:44.591 --> 01:59:47.140
<v Speaker 5>I would have told you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll bet you $1,000.</v>

2780
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 5>It was the second round and I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remembered it.</v>

2781
01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:52.900
<v Speaker 5>I remembered it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was moments in the fight with the</v>

2782
01:59:52.901 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 5>fights playing out and this is something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't have any attachment to me</v>

2783
01:59:56.741 --> 01:59:57.910
<v Speaker 5>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously.</v>

2784
01:59:57.911 --> 02:00:01.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm not like saying that someone's going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to throw in memory.</v>

2785
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:04.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially someone who is involved in</v>

2786
02:00:04.001 --> 02:00:06.490
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a violent crime where the</v>
<v Speaker 5>victim,</v>

2787
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:09.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know because I think it's gotta</v>

2788
02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:13.660
<v Speaker 5>be absolutely horrific and it's entirely</v>
<v Speaker 5>possible that some people can go through</v>

2789
02:00:13.661 --> 02:00:16.870
<v Speaker 5>an assault or a crime like that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember everything.</v>

2790
02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:20.590
<v Speaker 5>And then there's other people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>cannot cause people that even black out</v>

2791
02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:25.000
<v Speaker 5>horrible things because the memory is so</v>
<v Speaker 5>disturbing to them that they have to,</v>

2792
02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:26.950
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they blocked them out.</v>

2793
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Especially molestations a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>go through that later in life when they</v>

2794
02:00:31.061 --> 02:00:33.280
<v Speaker 5>realize like what they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>suppress.</v>

2795
02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.930
<v Speaker 5>Your brain is like literally trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>save you from these memories because</v>

2796
02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:40.810
<v Speaker 5>they're too fucking painful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what it does is it buries them,</v>

2797
02:00:41.170 --> 02:00:42.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't understand it,</v>

2798
02:00:42.911 --> 02:00:45.100
<v Speaker 5>but this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then people suddenly at 40 they go,</v>

2799
02:00:45.101 --> 02:00:47.440
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute is a proven effect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a proven effect.</v>

2800
02:00:47.441 --> 02:00:49.870
<v Speaker 5>So there's all these things that we need</v>
<v Speaker 5>to take into consideration.</v>

2801
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 5>I think there's also the very real</v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural benefit of having our first</v>

2802
02:00:54.731 --> 02:00:57.210
<v Speaker 5>woman president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think culturally what I do,</v>

2803
02:00:57.211 --> 02:01:00.970
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think that she's a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>representative in terms of like her need</v>

2804
02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:05.971
<v Speaker 5>for financial compensation for speeches</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Goldman Sachs connection and the</v>

2805
02:01:07.181 --> 02:01:11.080
<v Speaker 5>connection to the Saudis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also don't have a fucking clue as to</v>

2806
02:01:11.081 --> 02:01:13.850
<v Speaker 5>what it's like to deal with foreign</v>
<v Speaker 5>policy and foreign leaders.</v>

2807
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:16.060
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's even a voidable</v>

2808
02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:17.200
<v Speaker 5>but that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2809
02:01:17.201 --> 02:01:17.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people will say,</v>

2810
02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:19.990
<v Speaker 5>well the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the she's in bed with the Saudis or</v>

2811
02:01:19.991 --> 02:01:20.771
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well guess what?</v>

2812
02:01:20.771 --> 02:01:22.300
<v Speaker 5>The Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether we like it or not,</v>

2813
02:01:22.301 --> 02:01:25.630
<v Speaker 5>who do horrific things and explored all</v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of Wahhabi Islam and real</v>

2814
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:29.950
<v Speaker 5>extremism and or bombing the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yemen and with our weapons and all kinds</v>

2815
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:32.110
<v Speaker 5>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well she also took $1 million from</v>

2816
02:01:32.111 --> 02:01:36.010
<v Speaker 5>Qatar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Qatar right now is using slave labor to</v>

2817
02:01:36.011 --> 02:01:39.200
<v Speaker 5>build their World Cup stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which there may not even get the World</v>

2818
02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 5>Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2819
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.920
<v Speaker 4>it's like every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did they give her $1 million?</v>

2820
02:01:42.921 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 4>It's for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2821
02:01:44.331 --> 02:01:47.390
<v Speaker 4>It's not for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't give $1 million for no reason.</v>

2822
02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:49.190
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that again goes to like,</v>

2823
02:01:49.191 --> 02:01:51.440
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing how all this shit is made</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2824
02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:54.980
<v Speaker 4>And the simple fact is if you're upset</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she has a close relationship with</v>

2825
02:01:54.981 --> 02:01:57.740
<v Speaker 4>the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you got to hate Obama for it to</v>

2826
02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:00.020
<v Speaker 4>where I think a lot of these people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>letting that slide.</v>

2827
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even making a judgment call on</v>

2828
02:02:01.911 --> 02:02:05.210
<v Speaker 4>it as much to say is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are things that are going on at</v>

2829
02:02:05.211 --> 02:02:09.170
<v Speaker 4>extremely high levels for governments</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that we just have to try to decipher</v>

2830
02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:11.930
<v Speaker 4>some truth to it because we're not going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get another way.</v>

2831
02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women can't drive.</v>

2832
02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:15.710
<v Speaker 4>They can barely go out without men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are stuck in,</v>

2833
02:02:15.711 --> 02:02:18.620
<v Speaker 4>as Bill Maher says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beekeeper costumes in the Burkas,</v>

2834
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:20.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all of these things,</v>

2835
02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:22.760
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could they possibly be our ally if</v>

2836
02:02:22.761 --> 02:02:25.520
<v Speaker 4>we're for women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Barack Obama is for women,</v>

2837
02:02:25.521 --> 02:02:29.330
<v Speaker 4>if Hillary Clinton is for women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is Saudi Arabia one of our most</v>

2838
02:02:29.331 --> 02:02:32.180
<v Speaker 4>stable allies that we give a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 4>money too,</v>

2839
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:33.710
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's what it is.</v>

2840
02:02:33.810 --> 02:02:38.810
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that I would take into</v>
<v Speaker 5>consideration is that if I was trying to</v>

2841
02:02:39.091 --> 02:02:42.630
<v Speaker 5>figure this out as an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would see there's gotta be some</v>

2842
02:02:42.631 --> 02:02:47.631
<v Speaker 5>benefit to keeping people like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>connected to you and obligated to</v>

2843
02:02:48.241 --> 02:02:51.180
<v Speaker 5>communicate with you and oils and your</v>
<v Speaker 5>friend,</v>

2844
02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:54.630
<v Speaker 5>but not just the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also some other publishing,</v>

2845
02:02:54.690 --> 02:02:58.080
<v Speaker 5>a non combative relationship with a</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2846
02:02:58.081 --> 02:03:02.670
<v Speaker 5>very wealthy Middle East country that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're more could be done with honey</v>

2847
02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:03.840
<v Speaker 5>than with vinegar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2848
02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:06.030
<v Speaker 5>this idea of being connected with those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2849
02:03:06.031 --> 02:03:09.750
<v Speaker 5>there might be some sort of a benefit</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're so alien to us and</v>

2850
02:03:09.751 --> 02:03:12.120
<v Speaker 5>they're so dominant in their control</v>
<v Speaker 5>over their environment.</v>

2851
02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:15.000
<v Speaker 5>Like you look at these dictators in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>foreign,</v>

2852
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:17.670
<v Speaker 5>these foreign countries that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>supported for so many years and you can</v>

2853
02:03:17.671 --> 02:03:20.700
<v Speaker 5>make the argument that they're horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely terrible people that we</v>

2854
02:03:20.701 --> 02:03:21.720
<v Speaker 5>should have nothing to do with.</v>

2855
02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:26.160
<v Speaker 5>You could also make the argument that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that part of the world is so fucked up</v>

2856
02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:31.170
<v Speaker 5>that you have to somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 5>maintain some sort of friendly</v>

2857
02:03:31.171 --> 02:03:33.030
<v Speaker 5>connection to the people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

2858
02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:36.360
<v Speaker 5>And then that might be the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep everybody safe.</v>

2859
02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:38.970
<v Speaker 5>While we figured out a fucking strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to deal with religious</v>

2860
02:03:38.971 --> 02:03:40.960
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy people that literally have</v>

2861
02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:44.400
<v Speaker 5>trillions of dollars at their disposal</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do anything they want from the</v>

2862
02:03:44.401 --> 02:03:45.234
<v Speaker 5>Saudis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By yes,</v>

2863
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:49.200
<v Speaker 5>but not just from the Saudis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a gigantic chunk of the</v>

2864
02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.070
<v Speaker 5>Middle East that has so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's incomprehensible and not everyone,</v>

2865
02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.040
<v Speaker 5>just a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oligarchy,</v>

2866
02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:57.200
<v Speaker 5>monarchs and these people that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>looked at,</v>

2867
02:03:57.201 --> 02:04:00.000
<v Speaker 5>in Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make it rain every week.</v>

2868
02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.560
<v Speaker 5>They make it rain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>

2869
02:04:01.561 --> 02:04:06.390
<v Speaker 5>They literally see the sky to do cloud</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeding and they make it rain like it's</v>

2870
02:04:06.391 --> 02:04:09.090
<v Speaker 5>the desert and they use their money to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it rain.</v>

2871
02:04:09.091 --> 02:04:12.030
<v Speaker 5>Like not a strip club and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>using one</v>

2872
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:14.620
<v Speaker 4>is that wasn't hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was actual real well,</v>

2873
02:04:14.621 --> 02:04:17.380
<v Speaker 4>think about Egypt is the best example of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're talking about because Egypt</v>

2874
02:04:17.381 --> 02:04:19.390
<v Speaker 4>for 30 years had Mubarak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was a guy,</v>

2875
02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:22.030
<v Speaker 4>he was a military guy backed by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>

2876
02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Horrible on on a human rights and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that other stuff.</v>

2877
02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:29.260
<v Speaker 4>But he kept control of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically kept their borders,</v>

2878
02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:32.890
<v Speaker 4>kept peace with Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically kept things under control.</v>

2879
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:36.730
<v Speaker 4>I was in Egypt in 97 and it was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>disgusting actually.</v>

2880
02:04:36.731 --> 02:04:38.000
<v Speaker 4>Even go to the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the,</v>

2881
02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:40.390
<v Speaker 4>the pollution was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2882
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.590
<v Speaker 4>it was the people weren't friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I would love to go back.</v>

2883
02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.830
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend there now who I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2884
02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:49.020
<v Speaker 4>who's a youtube or this Guy Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who probably will show his face.</v>

2885
02:04:49.021 --> 02:04:51.450
<v Speaker 4>He's an atheist and a free thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2886
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 4>if I could ever get him to the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>

2887
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:53.250
<v Speaker 4>you should have me enter.</v>

2888
02:04:53.250 --> 02:04:54.450
<v Speaker 4>The guy's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's great.</v>

2889
02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Freely and openly and Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes he disappears for months and</v>

2890
02:04:59.281 --> 02:05:02.760
<v Speaker 4>then the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't really publicly say exactly</v>

2891
02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:05.340
<v Speaker 4>what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I had him on the show,</v>

2892
02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:06.151
<v Speaker 4>I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2893
02:05:06.151 --> 02:05:08.670
<v Speaker 4>if you want to wear a spiderman mask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to show your face.</v>

2894
02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:09.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do whatever you want.</v>

2895
02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.310
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2896
02:05:11.311 --> 02:05:13.140
<v Speaker 4>I want to show my face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

2897
02:05:13.141 --> 02:05:15.510
<v Speaker 4>they had Mubarak for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He kept the Muslim Brotherhood.</v>

2898
02:05:15.511 --> 02:05:18.090
<v Speaker 4>They were illegal under the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they have the Tahrir Square,</v>

2899
02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:20.070
<v Speaker 4>a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens?</v>

2900
02:05:20.071 --> 02:05:20.960
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we deposed,</v>

2901
02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:23.640
<v Speaker 4>we partly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they depose Mubarak,</v>

2902
02:05:23.641 --> 02:05:26.340
<v Speaker 4>they get the Muslim Brotherhood through</v>
<v Speaker 4>democracy,</v>

2903
02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:29.160
<v Speaker 4>and then a year later they realize these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys are way worse.</v>

2904
02:05:29.161 --> 02:05:31.560
<v Speaker 4>So what they got from democracy was way</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>

2905
02:05:31.561 --> 02:05:35.520
<v Speaker 4>So then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The military then steps in and then has</v>

2906
02:05:35.521 --> 02:05:39.720
<v Speaker 4>a coup overthrows the democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now they have a military leader</v>

2907
02:05:39.721 --> 02:05:42.090
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States the entire time to support</v>

2908
02:05:42.091 --> 02:05:42.924
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that.</v>

2909
02:05:43.170 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the problem with democracy.</v>

2910
02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:48.750
<v Speaker 4>And we know this from Iraq too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can give democracy,</v>

2911
02:05:48.751 --> 02:05:51.690
<v Speaker 4>but if the institutions aren't there</v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to support it,</v>

2912
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:54.600
<v Speaker 4>you could get a lot of bad people then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

2913
02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:59.670
<v Speaker 4>it's over like what the Hell's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you mentioned Bengazi before we got</v>

2914
02:05:59.671 --> 02:06:01.800
<v Speaker 4>rid of Qaddafi who was obviously a bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2915
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:03.980
<v Speaker 4>You have any idea what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>government there isn't it</v>

2916
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:06.280
<v Speaker 2>fear right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows is a scary state.</v>

2917
02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a state of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2918
02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>So it was a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're more aware of uh,</v>

2919
02:06:13.210 --> 02:06:18.210

<v Speaker 2>working for CNN and she did a piece on</v>

02:07:24.341 --> 02:07:26.710
<v Speaker 2>do you remember she got fired if she</v>
<v Speaker 2>went up resigning,</v>

2950
02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.810
<v Speaker 2>do you remember anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2951
02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.390
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a resigning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2952
02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't if she was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she resigned.</v>

2953
02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2954
02:07:37.991 --> 02:07:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

2955
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:42.790
<v Speaker 2>she came on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wrote a book.</v>

2956
02:07:43.150 --> 02:07:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2957
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:48.780
<v Speaker 2>she sort of explained like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would really go on when you tried</v>

2958
02:07:48.781 --> 02:07:50.620
<v Speaker 2>to put together these pieces and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2959
02:07:50.621 --> 02:07:51.060
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2960
02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.540
<v Speaker 2>in defense of CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2961
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I know they had a rebuttal to what she</v>
<v Speaker 2>said and they disagreed with her,</v>

2962
02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:57.790
<v Speaker 2>her framing of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her memory of it,</v>

2963
02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:58.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2964
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds to me like whatever stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she found that was very</v>

2965
02:08:02.801 --> 02:08:05.920
<v Speaker 2>questionable did not make the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably why.</v>

2966
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was the CIA's talked pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>openly about having people that work in</v>

2967
02:08:11.021 --> 02:08:14.320
<v Speaker 2>different news organizations where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of framed the news.</v>

2968
02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

2969
02:08:15.521 --> 02:08:17.620
<v Speaker 2>that goes to everything we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this,</v>

2970
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>it all seems to be coming back to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of the online world and the old</v>

2971
02:08:22.301 --> 02:08:25.240
<v Speaker 2>school thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like starting to have parody now</v>

2972
02:08:25.241 --> 02:08:27.700
<v Speaker 2>where what we're doing is as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>influential,</v>

2973
02:08:27.701 --> 02:08:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan is more influential than</v>

2974
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>anybody on CNN in reality.</v>

2975
02:08:32.170 --> 02:08:33.760
<v Speaker 2>In the reality of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2976
02:08:33.761 --> 02:08:36.670
<v Speaker 2>but not a Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That man,</v>

2977
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:38.180
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Megan Kelly,</v>

2978
02:08:38.181 --> 02:08:39.280
<v Speaker 2>so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't gay,</v>

2979
02:08:39.281 --> 02:08:40.390

<v Speaker 2>She's so something violent about her.</v>

2982
02:08:45.550 --> 02:08:47.740
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something violent like masculine.</v>

2983
02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Like you would think of her as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>

2984
02:08:49.601 --> 02:08:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel like she has a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2985
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it her brain though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in her breakdown.</v>

2986
02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Externalizes oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know they're trying to give her $20</v>

2987

<v Speaker 2>million and she hasn't accepted yet or</v>

<v Speaker 2>worth it.</v>

2989
02:09:05.351 --> 02:09:07.570
<v Speaker 2>The networks useless without you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever she goes.</v>

2990
02:09:07.571 --> 02:09:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that crazy though?</v>

2991
02:09:09.161 --> 02:09:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it like 20 million bucks.</v>

2992
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Skipped perfect cheeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>

2993
02:09:13.380 --> 02:09:15.910
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She deserves it.</v>

2994
02:09:16.510 --> 02:09:18.190
<v Speaker 2>She's very good talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's good man.</v>

2995
02:09:18.191 --> 02:09:20.100
<v Speaker 2>She's very eloquent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that thing that you went,</v>

2996
02:09:20.110 --> 02:09:21.340
<v Speaker 2>went at it with Newt Gingrich?</v>

2997
02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Newt Gingrich is a fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>

2998
02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:24.940
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2999
02:09:24.941 --> 02:09:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I have a little bit of a love hate thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them cause I do the,</v>

3000
02:09:27.121 --> 02:09:29.190
<v Speaker 2>he's really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart guy.</v>

3001
02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:30.640
<v Speaker 2>He's really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He understands.</v>

3002
02:09:30.641 --> 02:09:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Like when I talked before about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing what the role of government is</v>

3003
02:09:34.061 --> 02:09:36.700
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff that we should know</v>
<v Speaker 2>more about in civics and all that.</v>

3004
02:09:36.701 --> 02:09:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy gets it in and out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you agree with his politics or</v>

3005
02:09:40.391 --> 02:09:42.800
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did do some stuff with the contract</v>

3006
02:09:42.801 --> 02:09:44.800
<v Speaker 2>with America to with America to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3007
02:09:44.801 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 2>move the country in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually surprised he hasn't run for</v>

3008
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:50.350
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he ran four years ago and they</v>

3009
02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:52.780
<v Speaker 2>basically remember at that point when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right.</v>

3010
02:09:52.781 --> 02:09:54.940
<v Speaker 2>That was the whole thing with his wife</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he left,</v>

3011
02:09:54.941 --> 02:09:59.941
<v Speaker 2>his wife was sick and had another bra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a weird way he was the precursor to</v>

3012
02:10:01.061 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 2>trump because you remembered that during</v>
<v Speaker 2>those primaries he would be,</v>

3013
02:10:04.391 --> 02:10:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was really good with zingers and with</v>

3014
02:10:06.071 --> 02:10:09.730
<v Speaker 2>some comedy and he would get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience to applaud and cheer and boo</v>

3015
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:13.240
<v Speaker 2>talking about the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media and they boo and hiss and then</v>

3016
02:10:13.241 --> 02:10:17.110
<v Speaker 2>suddenly the moderators started saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time there'll be no booing or</v>

3017
02:10:17.111 --> 02:10:19.600
<v Speaker 2>applauding or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like sit there like a fucking</v>

3018
02:10:19.601 --> 02:10:20.140
<v Speaker 2>robot.</v>

3019
02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:22.440
<v Speaker 2>It's 1984 and eight press here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stay.</v>

3020
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:24.950
<v Speaker 2>That's American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's American.</v>

3021
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:28.270
<v Speaker 2>They do it now in the debates door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be silence.</v>

3022
02:10:28.271 --> 02:10:28.930
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3023
02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:31.240
<v Speaker 2>cause she'd be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

3024
02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3025
02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you'd be in jail cause it should be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

3026
02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 2>That was in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best bomb ever dropped on a</v>

3027
02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 2>presidential debate next to I knew Jack</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy.</v>

3028
02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:43.520
<v Speaker 2>You're no jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

3029
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Against Dan Quayle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even remember who the other</v>

3030
02:10:46.401 --> 02:10:48.140
<v Speaker 2>dude is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lloyd Benson.</v>

3031
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Lloyd Benson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3033
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like something else.</v>

3034
02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.610
<v Speaker 2>You talked about parallel universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't that I watched,</v>

3035
02:10:57.611 --> 02:10:59.090
<v Speaker 2>this is going to sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be corny as hell,</v>

3036
02:10:59.091 --> 02:11:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but about two weeks ago I was sitting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday.</v>

3037
02:11:01.851 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just flipping the channels.</v>

3038
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Cspan comes on and they're replaying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>1992 debate between George Hw Bush.</v>

3039
02:11:08.451 --> 02:11:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton running for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Perot and I watched about a half</v>

3040
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:14.360
<v Speaker 2>hour of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think three o'clock on a Saturday and</v>

3041
02:11:14.361 --> 02:11:16.280
<v Speaker 2>he really was like being in an alternate</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

3042
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:19.550
<v Speaker 2>It felt so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were actually talking about</v>

3043
02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:22.560
<v Speaker 2>economics or Ross Perot with is try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this and we don't know.</v>

3044
02:11:22.561 --> 02:11:24.000
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of me and Wilma and bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3045
02:11:24.001 --> 02:11:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like wow.</v>

3046
02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.730
<v Speaker 2>There was actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about politics.</v>

3047
02:11:29.210 --> 02:11:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was completely fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was all bullshit and lies and</v>

3048
02:11:32.391 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about politics and that was</v>

3049
02:11:35.091 --> 02:11:36.380
<v Speaker 2>only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

3050
02:11:36.381 --> 02:11:38.570
<v Speaker 2>That's 20 years ago basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3051
02:11:38.571 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 2>This is a different era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the reality TV show air.</v>

3052
02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:44.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have this joke that I never</v>

3053
02:11:44.301 --> 02:11:47.000
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to get to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's sort of just an observation</v>

3054
02:11:47.150 --> 02:11:50.720
<v Speaker 2>that there's so many people with shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's just a pr like this is</v>

3055
02:11:50.730 --> 02:11:54.440
<v Speaker 2>like when Jersey shore was around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to have a show one day</v>

3056
02:11:54.441 --> 02:11:57.620
<v Speaker 2>where it's going to be a reality show</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a reality camera man.</v>

3057
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:59.450
<v Speaker 2>And then we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3058
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 2>We're going to follow that guy around as</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes to all these exotic places and</v>

3059
02:12:02.511 --> 02:12:04.430
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people getting drunk on the beach.</v>

3060
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:07.730
<v Speaker 2>And then one day we're going to want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know who's the man behind the camera,</v>

3061
02:12:07.731 --> 02:12:10.280
<v Speaker 2>behind the man behind the camera and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to follow that guy</v>

3062
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:11.870
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get a reality show is</v>

3063
02:12:11.871 --> 02:12:15.140
<v Speaker 2>going to be a reality show about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera man who's on a reality show about</v>

3064
02:12:15.141 --> 02:12:17.120
<v Speaker 2>a camera man who's a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>

3065
02:12:17.121 --> 02:12:22.121
<v Speaker 2>Cameramen deeper and deeper and deeper</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the whole world is filled with</v>

3066
02:12:22.281 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 2>people on a reality show while they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding up a camera like two mirrors</v>

3067
02:12:25.761 --> 02:12:28.670
<v Speaker 2>facing themselves with infinite camera</v>
<v Speaker 2>man in each direction.</v>

3068
02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:31.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what we have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some good weed.</v>

3069
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Well this is what we have though is</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

3070
02:12:34.151 --> 02:12:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an old bit that I never figured out</v>

3071
02:12:35.901 --> 02:12:38.870
<v Speaker 2>how to get to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point being is like this is what</v>

3072
02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:39.980
<v Speaker 2>we're experiencing.</v>

3073
02:12:40.190 --> 02:12:42.110
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're experiencing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>

3074
02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be on a network on a bravo</v>

3075
02:12:46.311 --> 02:12:49.580
<v Speaker 2>coming up next at eight it's Mike the</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera man on a reality show.</v>

3076
02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.200
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be by a network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is what you're having with something</v>

3077
02:12:54.201 --> 02:12:56.850
<v Speaker 2>like periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is what you're having when people are</v>

3078
02:12:56.851 --> 02:12:58.490
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook streaming from,</v>

3079
02:12:58.550 --> 02:13:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amusement parks or whatever the fuck</v>

3080
02:13:00.171 --> 02:13:01.700
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reality show.</v>

3081
02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:02.960
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you blend,</v>

3082
02:13:02.961 --> 02:13:07.580
<v Speaker 2>how much of your Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual human versus Joe Rogan,</v>

3083
02:13:07.581 --> 02:13:08.870
<v Speaker 2>the public person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

3084
02:13:08.871 --> 02:13:13.470
<v Speaker 2>where do you put that line in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>periscoping from home or showing I don't</v>

3085
02:13:13.471 --> 02:13:15.440
<v Speaker 2>do this stuff because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

3086
02:13:15.441 --> 02:13:17.960
<v Speaker 2>People know my wife and kids aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>public people.</v>

3087
02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be,</v>

3088
02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:20.600
<v Speaker 2>they're just regular people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because they know me,</v>

3089
02:13:20.601 --> 02:13:23.180
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean I should drag them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this nonsense.</v>

3090
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I just think all of us could do better</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a little less interaction</v>

3091
02:13:30.321 --> 02:13:33.480
<v Speaker 2>digitally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's happening so fast that,</v>

3092
02:13:33.690 --> 02:13:35.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're talking about people at</v>

3093
02:13:35.131 --> 02:13:39.120
<v Speaker 2>restaurants that are constantly on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and when you check them on it,</v>

3094
02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>they get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been upset.</v>

3095
02:13:40.890 --> 02:13:42.210
<v Speaker 2>People telling me to put my phone down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3096
02:13:42.211 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3097
02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.820
<v Speaker 2>it's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's natural reaction.</v>

3098
02:13:44.821 --> 02:13:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I think we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3099
02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:50.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us are going to eventually though</v>

3100
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:55.401
<v Speaker 2>step into that great divide and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future is going to be everybody all the</v>

3101
02:13:56.731 --> 02:13:58.620
<v Speaker 2>time connected to everybody all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3102
02:13:58.621 --> 02:14:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to be very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change thought.</v>

3103
02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we really are going to become</v>

3104
02:14:04.741 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of a bizarre hive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they do.</v>

3105
02:14:07.351 --> 02:14:09.720
<v Speaker 2>They've done studies where the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

3106
02:14:09.721 --> 02:14:12.320
<v Speaker 2>when they look at Internet addicts that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find that the,</v>

3107
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:15.090
<v Speaker 2>the wiring in their brain actually has</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

3108
02:14:15.091 --> 02:14:19.380
<v Speaker 2>It's changed certain synapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually caused like membranes to</v>

3109
02:14:19.381 --> 02:14:21.660
<v Speaker 2>shrink into all kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last,</v>

3110
02:14:21.661 --> 02:14:24.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was may I for eight days and</v>

3111
02:14:24.811 --> 02:14:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never take off.</v>

3112
02:14:26.281 --> 02:14:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the last time I took</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some actual time of,</v>

3113
02:14:28.171 --> 02:14:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I took eight days off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Mexico.</v>

3114
02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I locked my phone in a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3115
02:14:33.090 --> 02:14:34.980
<v Speaker 2>We're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my husband did it lock the phone in the</v>

3116
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:37.170
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know the code word for eight</v>

3117
02:14:37.171 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat on a beach.</v>

3118
02:14:38.610 --> 02:14:39.660
<v Speaker 2>It was at like an Olympian.</v>

3119
02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 2>It was like a digital moderately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dirtiest thing we've ever done.</v>

3120
02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you want that phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really,</v>

3121
02:14:49.861 --> 02:14:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it was why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3122
02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:53.850
<v Speaker 2>but for eight days I had no phone and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid you not,</v>

3123
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean I felt my brain kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>resetting.</v>

3124
02:14:57.130 --> 02:14:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I felt some things happening and also I</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt more,</v>

3125
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I felt more patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

3126
02:15:01.561 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in conversations where,</v>

3127
02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:03.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like this,</v>

3128
02:15:03.991 --> 02:15:07.170
<v Speaker 2>but where you're constantly just</v>
<v Speaker 2>distracted by every little thing.</v>

3129
02:15:07.171 --> 02:15:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I got away from it and then when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got back on the grid,</v>

3130
02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because immediately the second I got off</v>

3131
02:15:12.301 --> 02:15:13.170
<v Speaker 2>the plane and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3132
02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:14.520
<v Speaker 2>doing my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realize,</v>

3133
02:15:14.521 --> 02:15:14.941
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3134
02:15:14.941 --> 02:15:17.280
<v Speaker 2>the world went on and it was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually okay.</v>

3135
02:15:17.281 --> 02:15:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed some shit.</v>

3136
02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happened on my show that took,</v>

3137
02:15:20.491 --> 02:15:21.510
<v Speaker 2>that got a lot of news.</v>

3138
02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about it for eight days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

3139
02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:26.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like some shit happened.</v>

3140
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:28.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3141
02:15:28.630 --> 02:15:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3142
02:15:29.730 --> 02:15:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to judge people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>using these things,</v>

3143
02:15:32.941 --> 02:15:34.980
<v Speaker 2>using these devices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to talk about it as</v>

3144
02:15:34.981 --> 02:15:38.130
<v Speaker 2>honestly as I can because I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost inevitable.</v>

3145
02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:42.000
<v Speaker 2>But I think for your own personal good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be managed carefully.</v>

3146
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to take audit of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that's in your life.</v>

3147
02:15:46.050 --> 02:15:51.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you spend like I have an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a half just reading through tweets about</v>

3148
02:15:52.471 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 2>like almost nothing and just looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something interesting.</v>

3149
02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Just constantly scrolling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for something interesting.</v>

3150
02:15:57.571 --> 02:16:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Like step away from that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're,</v>

3151
02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you're impulsively or me speaking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to me impulsively checking</v>

3152
02:16:05.251 --> 02:16:08.010
<v Speaker 2>images on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Cool Shit did people post up?</v>

3153
02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:10.680
<v Speaker 2>You know what interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my main news is out there right now,</v>

3154
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:12.670
<v Speaker 2>but you know what is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3155
02:16:12.671 --> 02:16:15.520
<v Speaker 2>the latest trending topics on twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.520
<v Speaker 2>After a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck am I doing?</v>

3157
02:16:17.521 --> 02:16:18.420
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about my life?</v>

3158
02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.190
<v Speaker 2>What about me as a person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I doing?</v>

3159
02:16:20.191 --> 02:16:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3160
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I framed it like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>between Joe Rogan,</v>

3161
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 2>the public person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then actually the human that has to</v>

3162
02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and live and do this operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kids and a wife</v>

3163
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.680
<v Speaker 5>and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are two separate things.</v>

3164
02:16:32.681 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 5>And yet you got to bring them somehow</v>
<v Speaker 5>into harmony so that they can exist</v>

3165
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:38.050
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A big ones.</v>

3166
02:16:38.051 --> 02:16:39.560
<v Speaker 5>Meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>

3167
02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Meditation and thinking about what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually want to do versus what your</v>

3168
02:16:43.511 --> 02:16:48.010
<v Speaker 5>momentum is leading you towards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And for me it's isolation tanks.</v>

3169
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 5>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3170
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:51.490
<v Speaker 5>I have one of my patients,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use it all the time.</v>

3171
02:16:51.491 --> 02:16:55.450
<v Speaker 5>I think about things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're in an undistracted way and I</v>

3172
02:16:55.451 --> 02:16:58.940
<v Speaker 5>take an evaluation of like how I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking and I,</v>

3173
02:16:59.060 --> 02:17:01.210
<v Speaker 5>it was always like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the things that people</v>

3174
02:17:01.211 --> 02:17:03.190
<v Speaker 5>don't like about getting high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of the things that people</v>

3175
02:17:03.191 --> 02:17:06.350
<v Speaker 5>don't like about isolation tanks and or</v>
<v Speaker 5>yoga class too.</v>

3176

3177
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:11.830

<v Speaker 5>examine their shit.</v>

3178
02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:14.860
<v Speaker 5>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it forces you to look at your stuff when</v>

3179

<v Speaker 5>the word.</v>

3181
02:17:19.221 --> 02:17:20.290
<v Speaker 5>It seems like something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>shape or form.</v>

3202
02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:15.910
<v Speaker 5>You have this guy who brought this thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>its beak from yoga to America and he</v>

3203
02:18:15.911 --> 02:18:18.280

<v Speaker 5>It's been around for thousands of years</v>

3204
02:18:18.281 --> 02:18:21.790
<v Speaker 5>and he tried to sue people for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>patent and all the movements he lost.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and sort of promoted yoga too.</v>

3207
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:33.730

<v Speaker 5>He's like one of the most directly</v>

3208
02:18:33.731 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 5>responsible people for promoting this</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

3209
02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:39.070
<v Speaker 5>But then you see him as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a crazy fuck.</v>

02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:41.980

<v Speaker 5>You have to sit there and listen to them</v>

<v Speaker 5>talk and if you have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to go in your pants.</v>

3212
02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:48.070
<v Speaker 5>Like it's all like cult shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes them stay up all night and</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's like a fuck you.</v>

3214
02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:53.110
<v Speaker 5>He's a crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got rolls royces and shit.</v>

3215
02:18:53.111 --> 02:18:56.380
<v Speaker 5>And they busted him with all these cars</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said that he was gonna open up a</v>

3216
02:18:56.381 --> 02:18:59.440
<v Speaker 5>school for children to learn</v>
<v Speaker 5>automobiles.</v>

3217
02:18:59.530 --> 02:19:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I bought these Rolls Royces.</v>

3218
02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 5>It's a school for underprivileged</v>
<v Speaker 5>children with Rolls Royce.</v>

3219
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:05.920
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

3220
02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:08.140
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that goes to the worship thing that</v>

3221
02:19:08.141 --> 02:19:10.390
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about and that's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we see these people worshiping</v>

3222
02:19:10.391 --> 02:19:14.530
<v Speaker 5>Hillary or worshiping trump and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they are not going to solve all</v>

3223
02:19:14.531 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 5>your problems and not only are they not</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to stop weapons,</v>

3224
02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:19.030
<v Speaker 5>they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The president should.</v>

3225
02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:23.530
<v Speaker 5>The president should keep the road safe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The president should make sure nobody</v>

3226
02:19:23.531 --> 02:19:25.390
<v Speaker 5>bombs us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The president should make sure the</v>

3227
02:19:25.391 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 5>economy keeps chugging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just think about the shit jobs that you</v>

3228
02:19:27.951 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 5>just</v>

3229
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:30.140
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does one person have those three</v>

3230
02:19:30.141 --> 02:19:32.490
<v Speaker 3>important jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>

3231
02:19:32.491 --> 02:19:35.300
<v Speaker 3>You get a guy for the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's ridiculous,</v>

3232
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:37.700
<v Speaker 3>you get the department or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call him,</v>

3233
02:19:37.701 --> 02:19:38.720
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a job.</v>

3234
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to go check these roads working sly</v>

3235
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 3>in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see the road.</v>

3236
02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:44.450
<v Speaker 3>But the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's actually,</v>

3237
02:19:44.451 --> 02:19:48.050
<v Speaker 3>that's actually the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not supposed to be our</v>

3238
02:19:48.051 --> 02:19:50.180
<v Speaker 3>guide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not supposed to be our emperor.</v>

3239
02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:52.520
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to keep the ship</v>
<v Speaker 3>afloat,</v>

3240
02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:54.700
<v Speaker 3>but as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want champs.</v>

3241
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:55.543
<v Speaker 3>We want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

3242
02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:56.390
<v Speaker 3>We want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3243
02:19:56.390 --> 02:19:59.960
<v Speaker 3>We want to bring jfk back to life when a</v>
<v Speaker 3>clone them and even him,</v>

3244
02:19:59.961 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 3>he would never survive today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the crazy shit that guy was up to.</v>

3245
02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:05.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he would have made wiener</v>

3246
02:20:05.481 --> 02:20:08.960
<v Speaker 3>looked like a Catholic school gave him</v>
<v Speaker 3>or that's Graham gram account.</v>

3247
02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many people like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are complicated.</v>

3248
02:20:15.350 --> 02:20:19.880
<v Speaker 3>They're not that we have this narrative</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been created by film and buy</v>

3249
02:20:19.881 --> 02:20:22.100
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this false narrative of this</v>

3250
02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:25.070
<v Speaker 3>perfect human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This John Wayne care two rides off into</v>

3251
02:20:25.071 --> 02:20:27.440
<v Speaker 3>the sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this clint eastwood who are,</v>

3252
02:20:27.441 --> 02:20:29.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sondra Locke has always waving goodbye</v>

3253
02:20:29.571 --> 02:20:31.730
<v Speaker 3>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's your rides off and away from the</v>

3254
02:20:31.731 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is all a false narrative</v>

3255
02:20:33.891 --> 02:20:38.891
<v Speaker 3>and it's created in such a potent way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that our brains are stained by that and</v>

3256
02:20:39.261 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 3>we kind of expect that out of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders instead of,</v>

3257
02:20:41.810 --> 02:20:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I think that's not the case in other</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>

3258
02:20:43.971 --> 02:20:46.040
<v Speaker 3>like in Europe in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3259
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.660
<v Speaker 3>In Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in France,</v>

3260
02:20:47.930 --> 02:20:51.380
<v Speaker 3>like politicians dare fucking affairs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

3261
02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Nabisco running a brothel or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3262
02:20:54.061 --> 02:20:54.580
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3263
02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:55.413
<v Speaker 3>we're having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Italy.</v>

3264
02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Italy is another example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different world.</v>

3265
02:20:58.850 --> 02:21:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've developed a very strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture over here in America.</v>

3266
02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Very strange and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways confused culture both</v>

3267
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:08.150
<v Speaker 3>in the positive and in the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3268
02:21:08.151 --> 02:21:13.151
<v Speaker 3>and bolt and the condemnation of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people like trump have said or you</v>

3269
02:21:13.311 --> 02:21:15.650
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like Clinton have allegedly done.</v>

3270
02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:18.640
<v Speaker 3>And also our reaction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them were,</v>

3271
02:21:18.641 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 3>we're weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just fucking weird man.</v>

3272
02:21:21.390 --> 02:21:23.570
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we've really fully</v>

3273
02:21:23.571 --> 02:21:28.571
<v Speaker 3>embraced our weirdness as a species yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of the problem with</v>

3274
02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 3>being a president in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on bullshit.</v>

3275
02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's based on the idea that you can give</v>

3276
02:21:35.571 --> 02:21:39.080
<v Speaker 3>people power and they won't abuse it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of an ancient scroll.</v>

3277
02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone,</v>

3278
02:21:41.271 --> 02:21:44.360
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many moons ago before electricity,</v>

3279
02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:47.630
<v Speaker 3>they figured out how to make anc of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>bugs and shit.</v>

3280
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Whether you use charcoal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they used to make any,</v>

3281
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:52.880
<v Speaker 3>I was going to buy the bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems sensible.</v>

3282
02:21:52.930 --> 02:21:57.020
<v Speaker 3>They dip their quill into that and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would write on a scroll,</v>

3283
02:21:57.021 --> 02:21:58.700
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was mostly made out of hemp.</v>

3284
02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Most of these hemp paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

3285
02:22:00.621 --> 02:22:04.730
<v Speaker 3>everyone is incredibly complex and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do with we're all flawed.</v>

3286
02:22:04.731 --> 02:22:07.610
<v Speaker 3>We all fail every day and succeed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>

3287
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:09.440
<v Speaker 3>You could look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Thomas Jefferson.</v>

3288
02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:11.870
<v Speaker 3>I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my cousin got married near Monte Cello</v>

3289
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:13.050
<v Speaker 3>in Virginia where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

3290
02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:14.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where his house was and</v>

3291
02:22:14.391 --> 02:22:15.970
<v Speaker 3>everything where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3292
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:18.740
<v Speaker 3>where he lived and owned slaves and had</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex with some of the slaves and one of</v>

3293
02:22:18.741 --> 02:22:22.070
<v Speaker 3>the slaves had sex with several of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was having a good time.</v>

3294
02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

3295
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:24.950
<v Speaker 3>But think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was writing the very,</v>

3296
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 3>that ultimately</v>

3297
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.680
<v Speaker 4>freed the slaves while at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 4>in effect,</v>

3298
02:22:28.681 --> 02:22:30.840
<v Speaker 4>you could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure people have argued this,</v>

3299
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:33.660
<v Speaker 4>that he was raping a slave because if it</v>
<v Speaker 4>is about power,</v>

3300
02:22:33.690 --> 02:22:36.720
<v Speaker 4>even if she was fully down with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was his slave.</v>

3301
02:22:36.721 --> 02:22:38.040
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3302
02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time he was also a</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing the very laws to free them.</v>

3303
02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:47.700
<v Speaker 4>That shows you how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how flawed all of us are that you could</v>

3304
02:22:47.701 --> 02:22:49.770
<v Speaker 4>hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could hate him for,</v>

3305
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:52.620
<v Speaker 4>for owning slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could hate him for having this</v>

3306
02:22:52.621 --> 02:22:54.270
<v Speaker 4>relationship with this woman and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3307
02:22:54.450 --> 02:22:58.740
<v Speaker 4>And at the same time he was instrumental</v>
<v Speaker 4>in writing the very laws that made us</v>

3308
02:22:58.741 --> 02:23:01.590
<v Speaker 4>all equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that goes and you could,</v>

3309
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.310
<v Speaker 4>that's why it's so dangerous when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>look back on a different time and you</v>

3310
02:23:05.311 --> 02:23:09.750
<v Speaker 4>try to apply our morality of today on</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

3311
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:11.160
<v Speaker 4>It's on other times.</v>

3312
02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.960
<v Speaker 4>It's so dangerous because you could look</v>
<v Speaker 4>at him and go,</v>

3313
02:23:12.961 --> 02:23:14.310
<v Speaker 4>fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

3314
02:23:14.311 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 4>let's erase every bit of history the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did with the dukes of hazzard car and</v>

3315
02:23:18.331 --> 02:23:19.450
<v Speaker 4>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

3316
02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:21.420
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a thing that existed.</v>

3317
02:23:21.450 --> 02:23:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Confederate flags go back to generally</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets you to the generally,</v>

3318
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:27.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it should be on the car and</v>

3319
02:23:27.601 --> 02:23:29.280
<v Speaker 4>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Land shouldn't have taken the show off</v>

3320
02:23:29.281 --> 02:23:30.720
<v Speaker 4>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3321
02:23:30.721 --> 02:23:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Like Bill Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told you this last time I was here.</v>

3322
02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy was my hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went into comedy because I was five</v>

3323
02:23:37.201 --> 02:23:40.440
<v Speaker 4>years old and I saw bill cosby himself</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he's talking about chocolate cake</v>

3324
02:23:40.441 --> 02:23:42.750
<v Speaker 4>and Theo and Vanessa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>

3325
02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:45.780
<v Speaker 4>And I thought it was the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing ever and it changed my</v>

3326
02:23:45.781 --> 02:23:47.400
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changed the course of my life.</v>

3327
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Now my childhood hero is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 4>serial rapist of all time.</v>

3328
02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3329
02:23:51.901 --> 02:23:53.790
<v Speaker 4>That's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:57.090
<v Speaker 4>That's another great example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy should really think about what</v>

3331
02:23:57.091 --> 02:23:59.370
<v Speaker 4>goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could absolutely draw a line between</v>

3332
02:23:59.371 --> 02:24:02.640
<v Speaker 4>bill cosby and Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can clearly draw a line that if bill</v>

3333
02:24:02.641 --> 02:24:07.020
<v Speaker 4>cosby and that shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're both black.</v>

3334
02:24:07.021 --> 02:24:07.900
<v Speaker 4>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3335
02:24:08.130 --> 02:24:11.400
<v Speaker 4>but you could draw a line to say that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>that show had not been on NBC primetime</v>

3336
02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:14.700
<v Speaker 4>in had he not done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that middle class upstanding family.</v>

3337
02:24:14.701 --> 02:24:18.510
<v Speaker 4>But that was incredibly funny and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great stuff about cosby that that</v>

3338
02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:21.660
<v Speaker 4>led to eventually 20 some odd years</v>
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>

3339
02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:26.160
<v Speaker 4>Barack Obama being president and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at the same time he was a horrific</v>

3340
02:24:26.161 --> 02:24:29.490
<v Speaker 4>rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that like a lot of his</v>

3341
02:24:29.491 --> 02:24:31.980
<v Speaker 4>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this goes back to the sort of tied</v>

3342
02:24:31.981 --> 02:24:33.390
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slingshot effect,</v>

3343
02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:37.740
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of his sort of projected</v>
<v Speaker 4>morality was to make up for the fact</v>

3344
02:24:37.741 --> 02:24:39.200
<v Speaker 4>that it was drug and chicks and rape.</v>

3345
02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:42.240
<v Speaker 4>And I'm so he was America's Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3346
02:24:42.241 --> 02:24:46.230
<v Speaker 4>And he was also like the ups down</v>
<v Speaker 4>upstanding citizen for the black</v>

3347
02:24:46.231 --> 02:24:50.460
<v Speaker 4>community to get upset if comedians</v>
<v Speaker 4>would swear that whole thing with Eddie</v>

3348
02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:50.730
<v Speaker 4>Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3349
02:24:50.730 --> 02:24:53.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not just him or not just uh,</v>

3350
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I believe the same with Dave</v>

3351
02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:57.930
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he had a problem with Chris</v>

3352
02:24:57.930 --> 02:24:59.310
<v Speaker 4>Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what he,</v>

3353
02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:03.780
<v Speaker 4>what he stood for as was like this</v>
<v Speaker 4>really conservative,</v>

3354
02:25:03.781 --> 02:25:05.550
<v Speaker 4>really friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3355
02:25:05.551 --> 02:25:08.160
<v Speaker 4>don't we don't talk about Dick's and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pussies and all that stuff.</v>

3356
02:25:08.161 --> 02:25:12.810
<v Speaker 4>Like he had a whole thing about like</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was really old to before he got</v>

3357
02:25:12.811 --> 02:25:16.060
<v Speaker 4>caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a whole thing about w w talk</v>

3358
02:25:16.061 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't hit it.</v>

3359
02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:22.460
<v Speaker 4>We don't hit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>W W we know what I'm saying.</v>

3360
02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:23.990
<v Speaker 4>Can every comedian do</v>

3361
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:27.520
<v Speaker 3>a cause we can't even that impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And probably the only time I've ever</v>

3362
02:25:27.521 --> 02:25:29.260
<v Speaker 3>tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty decent.</v>

3363
02:25:29.261 --> 02:25:30.094
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3364
02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I need it needs work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>

3365
02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:35.620
<v Speaker 3>But the point being is that this guy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most vocal.</v>

3366
02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never heard of the common,</v>

3367
02:25:36.971 --> 02:25:40.000
<v Speaker 3>like you never heard George Wallace tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>other comedians what they should do.</v>

3368
02:25:40.001 --> 02:25:41.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never hear that from Paul,</v>

3369
02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Mooney maybe.</v>

3370
02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:45.260
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3371
02:25:45.261 --> 02:25:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3372
02:25:47.081 --> 02:25:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess partly partly that may have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>because cosby became such a big</v>

3373
02:25:50.561 --> 02:25:52.180
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3374
02:25:52.181 --> 02:25:54.580
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love both those guys,</v>

3375
02:25:54.610 --> 02:25:57.580
<v Speaker 3>especially George Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is like absolutely hilarious,</v>

3376
02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:02.760
<v Speaker 3>but he never got the level of mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 3>success where what he says has some sort</v>

3377
02:26:03.251 --> 02:26:06.220
<v Speaker 3>of cultural significance right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within the comedy world.</v>

3378
02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Cosby got to the place of it.</v>

3379
02:26:09.150 --> 02:26:10.840
<v Speaker 3>It's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beyond,</v>

3380
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:13.350
<v Speaker 3>it's beyond what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99.9,</v>

3381
02:26:13.351 --> 02:26:13.540
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

3382
02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:15.850
<v Speaker 3>9% of comics or any public figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually gets,</v>

3383
02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:19.900
<v Speaker 3>he gets a place in the scheme of</v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

3384
02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:20.721
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3385
02:26:20.721 --> 02:26:21.251
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

3386
02:26:21.251 --> 02:26:22.030
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3387
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:27.030
<v Speaker 3>he was the best example of like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>elevated person from this minority.</v>

3388
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Like the best example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well spoken.</v>

3389
02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:35.470
<v Speaker 3>He got a doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think it got a kind of a legit</v>

3390
02:26:35.471 --> 02:26:39.280
<v Speaker 3>one or you got an honorary one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pretty sure it was legit.</v>

3391
02:26:39.281 --> 02:26:43.060
<v Speaker 3>One was like from a paper that he had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>write and graduate school or something</v>

3392
02:26:43.061 --> 02:26:44.200
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you,</v>

3393
02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:46.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you got a legit one from New</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jersey.</v>

3394
02:26:46.841 --> 02:26:49.150
<v Speaker 3>He's actually an h cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write that out to me.</v>

3395
02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you can get an honorary</v>

3396
02:26:50.711 --> 02:26:53.950
<v Speaker 3>doctorate just for your humanitarian</v>
<v Speaker 3>work or cause people think you're slick.</v>

3397
02:26:54.370 --> 02:26:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heath cliff huxtable was a ob Gyn,</v>

3398
02:26:56.951 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 3>so there you go.</v>

3399
02:26:58.290 --> 02:27:00.430
<v Speaker 3>It must've went to school there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must have.</v>

3400
02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3401
02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grab her by the Pussy,</v>

3402
02:27:04.241 --> 02:27:06.130
<v Speaker 3>but you'd give her a drink first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>

3403
02:27:07.810 --> 02:27:09.490
<v Speaker 3>See now if you went to run for</v>
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>

3404
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 3>they go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd take that out of context and I</v>

3405
02:27:12.611 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did that caused me</v>

3406
02:27:14.741 --> 02:27:17.770
<v Speaker 3>worshiping pussy grabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see.</v>

3407
02:27:18.130 --> 02:27:19.540
<v Speaker 3>But it isn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

3408
02:27:19.541 --> 02:27:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Is this is sometimes referred to as</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor Cosby.</v>

3409
02:27:22.241 --> 02:27:25.360
<v Speaker 3>He has his doctorate in education from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the University of Massachusetts in</v>

3410
02:27:25.361 --> 02:27:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Amherst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He earned the degree in the mid 1970s a</v>

3411
02:27:28.331 --> 02:27:31.690
<v Speaker 3>thesis entitled the Integration of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Visual Media via fat Albert and the</v>

3412
02:27:31.691 --> 02:27:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Cosby kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I did my doctorate on.</v>

3413
02:27:33.850 --> 02:27:35.200
<v Speaker 3>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3414
02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:39.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a teaching aide and vehicle to</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve increased learning.</v>

3415
02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:40.740
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3416
02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 3>so that goes to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a,</v>

3417
02:27:43.031 --> 02:27:47.440
<v Speaker 3>was the public person really just</v>
<v Speaker 3>defending the horrible actions of the</v>

3418
02:27:47.441 --> 02:27:50.320
<v Speaker 3>private person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also he clearly was trying to do</v>

3419
02:27:50.321 --> 02:27:52.450
<v Speaker 3>good work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here it says,</v>

3420
02:27:52.451 --> 02:27:55.870
<v Speaker 3>but how he got his degree has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial ever since.</v>

3421
02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:00.760
<v Speaker 3>According to Michael Eric Dyson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sociology professor at Georgetown</v>

3422
02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:02.440
<v Speaker 3>University and acclaimed author of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Cosby,</v>

3423
02:28:02.441 --> 02:28:04.210
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And numerous other books.</v>

3424
02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Cosby dropped out of high school after</v>
<v Speaker 3>he flunked his 10th grade three times.</v>

3425
02:28:07.961 --> 02:28:09.820
<v Speaker 3>He enlisted in the navy where he got his</v>
<v Speaker 3>ged.</v>

3426
02:28:09.821 --> 02:28:13.360
<v Speaker 3>They enrolled at temple where he dropped</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to pursue a show business career is</v>

3427
02:28:13.361 --> 02:28:15.040
<v Speaker 3>unfinished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bachelor degree from Temple was</v>

3428
02:28:15.041 --> 02:28:17.290
<v Speaker 3>eventually it bestowed upon him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his life experience.</v>

3429
02:28:17.890 --> 02:28:21.440
<v Speaker 3>Cosby enrolled in a part time doctoral</v>
<v Speaker 3>student as the University of</v>

3430
02:28:21.441 --> 02:28:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts Amherst,</v>

3431
02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:23.840
<v Speaker 5>which awarded home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See?</v>

3432
02:28:23.841 --> 02:28:25.820
<v Speaker 5>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he dropped out of high school,</v>

3433
02:28:25.821 --> 02:28:29.390
<v Speaker 5>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got his ged enrolled in temple,</v>

3434
02:28:29.391 --> 02:28:33.020
<v Speaker 5>dropped out of that and got a doctorate</v>
<v Speaker 5>for writing about a cartoon.</v>

3435
02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 5>But even the bachelor's degree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're saying he had an unfinished</v>

3436
02:28:35.571 --> 02:28:37.490
<v Speaker 5>bachelor's degree because of life</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

3437
02:28:37.491 --> 02:28:40.010
<v Speaker 5>So he didn't get that degree reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

3438
02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:41.390
<v Speaker 5>that's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So both of them.</v>

3439
02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 5>So it's not entirely true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3440
02:28:43.161 --> 02:28:45.440
<v Speaker 5>he did get a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but obviously there's a,</v>

3441
02:28:45.770 --> 02:28:47.920
<v Speaker 5>there's an asterick attached to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3442
02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:49.520
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but separating it from that,</v>

3443
02:28:49.521 --> 02:28:51.690
<v Speaker 5>it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing that you're talking about is,</v>

3444
02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:53.750
<v Speaker 5>is pretty powerful stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That what you,</v>

3445
02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:56.660
<v Speaker 5>that he was doing this horrible shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>until and yet.</v>

3446
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:59.390
<v Speaker 5>And yet he enriched so many lives at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same time,</v>

3447
02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:02.960
<v Speaker 5>literally at the same time that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing this horrible stuff to these</v>

3448
02:29:02.961 --> 02:29:06.710
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was bringing so much goodness to the</v>

3449
02:29:06.711 --> 02:29:07.544
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

3450
02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.410
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's deep.</v>

3451
02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:12.110
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's fucking deep and that's people.</v>

3452
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.730
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the sooner we recognize how</v>

3453
02:29:16.731 --> 02:29:21.560
<v Speaker 5>flawed human beings are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the the better we're going to be off.</v>

3454
02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:24.470
<v Speaker 5>And I think also on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is another thing that I've talked</v>

3455
02:29:24.471 --> 02:29:26.420
<v Speaker 5>about on stage before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a real issue.</v>

3456
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:31.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't think human beings are designed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to take in the data for media.</v>

3457
02:29:31.911 --> 02:29:35.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we can truly distinguish</v>
<v Speaker 5>the difference between false narratives</v>

3458
02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:37.180
<v Speaker 5>and fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3459
02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:38.510
<v Speaker 5>I know we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3460
02:29:38.511 --> 02:29:41.030
<v Speaker 5>when you go to see a fucking movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know it's a movie you leave.</v>

3461
02:29:41.031 --> 02:29:43.010
<v Speaker 5>Lao is a good movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God Damn,</v>

3462
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:45.040
<v Speaker 5>can't wait for doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Strange to,</v>

3463
02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:47.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know it's a movie,</v>

3464
02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:51.230
<v Speaker 5>but there's an impact that that data has</v>
<v Speaker 5>on our mind that we have to,</v>

3465
02:29:51.231 --> 02:29:53.120
<v Speaker 5>even though we have to separate it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>move it around,</v>

3466
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:57.740
<v Speaker 5>that impact is there were designed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow like the tribal leader,</v>

3467
02:29:57.741 --> 02:30:02.060
<v Speaker 5>this old guy with scars who's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>survived battles and he has wisdom and</v>

3468
02:30:02.061 --> 02:30:06.530
<v Speaker 5>he knows the poems and we sit around the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire and we follow him because of actual</v>

3469
02:30:06.531 --> 02:30:08.480
<v Speaker 5>real live accomplishments in real life.</v>

3470
02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Things that we've seen him do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's how he stays alive is I stay</v>

3471
02:30:11.931 --> 02:30:13.550
<v Speaker 5>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas only 30 of us.</v>

3472
02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:15.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got fucking bear skins on and</v>

3473
02:30:15.771 --> 02:30:17.810
<v Speaker 5>we're living in a cave and we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't have much time.</v>

3474
02:30:17.811 --> 02:30:20.270
<v Speaker 5>We got to follow that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows how to stay alive and we might</v>

3475
02:30:20.271 --> 02:30:22.400
<v Speaker 5>not make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is a very real concern because</v>

3476
02:30:22.401 --> 02:30:24.170
<v Speaker 5>we know tribes that are gone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3477
02:30:24.171 --> 02:30:28.880
<v Speaker 5>So this is how human beings develop for</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking thousands of thousands of years.</v>

3478
02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:32.150
<v Speaker 5>If you believe in evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we went from being a monkey to</v>

3479
02:30:32.151 --> 02:30:34.370
<v Speaker 5>being a guy who's addicted to a cell</v>
<v Speaker 5>phone,</v>

3480
02:30:34.490 --> 02:30:38.930
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of steps along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in those steps we developed a lot of</v>

3481
02:30:38.931 --> 02:30:43.150
<v Speaker 5>these human reward systems where you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3482
02:30:43.151 --> 02:30:46.850
<v Speaker 5>you get used to and look forward to</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain things was those things,</v>

3483
02:30:46.851 --> 02:30:49.100
<v Speaker 5>those rewards will keep you alive.</v>

3484
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:51.560
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's being attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 5>females,</v>

3485
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:54.890
<v Speaker 5>the will spread your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That when you must be concerned about</v>

3486
02:30:54.891 --> 02:30:57.770
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a overcoming the</v>

3487
02:30:57.771 --> 02:30:59.510
<v Speaker 5>adversaries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you don't,</v>

3488
02:30:59.511 --> 02:31:01.310
<v Speaker 5>they're going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to stay alive.</v>

3489
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:05.300
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to figure out how to stay quiet</v>

3490
02:31:05.301 --> 02:31:08.600
<v Speaker 5>when you're hunting is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons today why women enjoy gossip and</v>

3491
02:31:08.601 --> 02:31:11.440
<v Speaker 5>men enjoy quiet and why the two are</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes incompatible.</v>

3492
02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:13.500
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a design,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women are designed,</v>

3493
02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:15.860
<v Speaker 5>they were trying to keep the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>tribe together so that sit around</v>

3494
02:31:15.861 --> 02:31:18.290
<v Speaker 5>washing clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got this dirty bitch fucks everybody</v>

3495
02:31:18.291 --> 02:31:19.750
<v Speaker 5>when we go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's,</v>

3496
02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

3497
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:21.080
<v Speaker 3>where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3498
02:31:21.090 --> 02:31:23.190
<v Speaker 3>And with the men they were out of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting parties and like shy,</v>

3499
02:31:23.191 --> 02:31:26.130
<v Speaker 3>everybody shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's pay attention?</v>

3500
02:31:26.131 --> 02:31:27.390
<v Speaker 3>We gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta stay close here.</v>

3501
02:31:27.570 --> 02:31:30.700
<v Speaker 3>And this is the whole reason why there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a difference in the way these to behave.</v>

3502
02:31:30.701 --> 02:31:34.860
<v Speaker 3>And this has all been like well</v>
<v Speaker 3>established by sociologists,</v>

3503
02:31:35.010 --> 02:31:37.710
<v Speaker 3>by people who have studied human</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

3504
02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:42.540
<v Speaker 3>I think that where we're at now with</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies and songs,</v>

3505
02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:45.630
<v Speaker 3>you're getting this data in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to process.</v>

3506
02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:47.610
<v Speaker 3>We obviously internally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3507
02:31:47.611 --> 02:31:50.530
<v Speaker 3>we obviously can rationalize and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I know that's just a song.</v>

3508
02:31:50.531 --> 02:31:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Or I know that's just a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know the Indiana Jones isn't a</v>

3509
02:31:53.101 --> 02:31:56.920
<v Speaker 3>real guy and he wouldn't just survive</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time the fucking bowling ball size</v>

3510
02:31:56.921 --> 02:31:58.140
<v Speaker 3>boulder comes his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>

3511
02:31:58.170 --> 02:32:01.290
<v Speaker 3>he would get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he got in the fridge and parked for</v>

3512
02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:04.530
<v Speaker 3>you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fucking Ark of the covenant.</v>

3513
02:32:04.530 --> 02:32:05.970
<v Speaker 3>How do you survive the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

3514
02:32:05.971 --> 02:32:08.660
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit going on in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could accept that the fucking news</v>

3515
02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:10.440
<v Speaker 3>goes to be apocalyptic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it.</v>

3516
02:32:10.441 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be replacing the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3517
02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:14.730
<v Speaker 3>The way it looked the other way from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuke.</v>

3518
02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.380
<v Speaker 3>That's all he needed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kidney Cancer.</v>

3519
02:32:16.381 --> 02:32:19.560
<v Speaker 3>He's got a fucking cool hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those,</v>

3520
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:24.590
<v Speaker 3>those narratives and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this life version is all data that's</v>

3521
02:32:25.050 --> 02:32:28.700
<v Speaker 3>entered into the human consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more we expose ourselves to it,</v>

3522
02:32:28.701 --> 02:32:31.530
<v Speaker 3>when kids are watching eight hours of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking television and uh,</v>

3523
02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:35.100
<v Speaker 3>people were like constantly and gross in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their phones and all this like two</v>

3524
02:32:35.101 --> 02:32:38.100
<v Speaker 3>dimensional data and video and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things on youtube,</v>

3525
02:32:38.310 --> 02:32:41.340
<v Speaker 3>the more that stuff gets into your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your life,</v>

3526
02:32:41.610 --> 02:32:43.740
<v Speaker 3>the less you're experiencing the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3527
02:32:43.770 --> 02:32:48.030
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a preparation for us</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a part of this hive mind.</v>

3528
02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Like these are the steps you take when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create this sort of new type of</v>

3529
02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:53.400
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3530
02:32:53.401 --> 02:32:54.410
<v Speaker 3>it's integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3531
02:32:54.411 --> 02:32:56.050
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the matrix that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3532
02:32:56.051 --> 02:33:00.030
<v Speaker 3>we're slowly morphing into this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

3533
02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to understand that what</v>

3534
02:33:01.621 --> 02:33:04.680
<v Speaker 3>happens there isn't real yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3535
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:06.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorta jumping all the way back to that,</v>

3536
02:33:06.781 --> 02:33:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Leslie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think it,</v>

3537
02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:09.870
<v Speaker 3>when people say mean things to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if you would look at your</v>

3538
02:33:09.871 --> 02:33:11.490
<v Speaker 3>twitter right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody is probably saying something</v>

3539
02:33:11.491 --> 02:33:14.370
<v Speaker 3>mean they will now how they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be really pissed.</v>

3540
02:33:14.371 --> 02:33:15.600
<v Speaker 3>You're a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You told them to do it.</v>

3541
02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:18.730
<v Speaker 3>You see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've sick.</v>

3542
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of mine are you already?</v>

3543
02:33:21.250 --> 02:33:22.790
<v Speaker 3>So they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll turn it on me door.</v>

3544
02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.420
<v Speaker 3>We're all fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3545
02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:26.130
<v Speaker 3>but point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those words,</v>

3546
02:33:26.131 --> 02:33:28.460
<v Speaker 3>it goes to that words are not acting</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like it.</v>

3547
02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:30.390
<v Speaker 3>So what someone said something mean to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3548
02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:31.470
<v Speaker 3>you got to get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3549
02:33:31.471 --> 02:33:33.480
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of my,</v>

3550
02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:35.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna sound sort of Corny,</v>

3551
02:33:35.281 --> 02:33:39.540
<v Speaker 3>but part of my success in the last year</v>
<v Speaker 3>is directly related to you because your</v>

3552
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:41.160
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my show is my,</v>

3553
02:33:41.161 --> 02:33:43.050
<v Speaker 3>for real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my show was taken off when I was on here</v>

3554
02:33:43.051 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 3>last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by you giving it a little bump here</v>

3555
02:33:46.081 --> 02:33:48.660
<v Speaker 3>and then you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been real good to me on social</v>

3556
02:33:48.661 --> 02:33:51.300
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You helped amplify what I do.</v>

3557
02:33:51.570 --> 02:33:54.360
<v Speaker 3>And in the process of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I now all my social media,</v>

3558
02:33:54.361 --> 02:33:57.360
<v Speaker 3>when I scroll in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become sort of meaningless.</v>

3559
02:33:57.390 --> 02:34:01.230
<v Speaker 3>It's become all noise because if 95% of</v>
<v Speaker 3>its good,</v>

3560
02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:03.450
<v Speaker 3>which it usually is low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>

3561
02:34:03.451 --> 02:34:05.760
<v Speaker 3>oh there's another nice one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice and it is nice,</v>

3562
02:34:05.761 --> 02:34:08.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not demeaning and people giving you</v>

3563
02:34:08.221 --> 02:34:11.340
<v Speaker 3>compliments just a nice things or I like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing or retweeting what I'm</v>

3564
02:34:11.341 --> 02:34:11.940
<v Speaker 3>doing or whatever.</v>

3565
02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:14.340
<v Speaker 3>That's all nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the bad ones come in and then,</v>

3566
02:34:14.341 --> 02:34:16.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason I focus on the bad</v>

3567
02:34:16.081 --> 02:34:18.460
<v Speaker 3>ones more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I just let it all becomes noise</v>

3568
02:34:18.461 --> 02:34:19.241
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3569
02:34:19.241 --> 02:34:23.900
<v Speaker 3>I just have to do what I do and then let</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of it be I,</v>

3570
02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:26.530
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We probably at this point can't respond</v>

3571
02:34:26.531 --> 02:34:27.730
<v Speaker 3>to everybody anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

3572
02:34:27.731 --> 02:34:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3573
02:34:28.810 --> 02:34:29.740
<v Speaker 3>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing.</v>

3574
02:34:29.741 --> 02:34:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like part of the,</v>

3575
02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:36.100
<v Speaker 3>the price to pay for a little success</v>
<v Speaker 3>here is that the part that used to be</v>

3576
02:34:36.101 --> 02:34:39.490
<v Speaker 3>fun when I would play around with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>more on there and spend more time</v>

3577
02:34:39.491 --> 02:34:40.900
<v Speaker 3>interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3578
02:34:40.901 --> 02:34:44.580
<v Speaker 3>it's become such like a cal vacate of</v>
<v Speaker 3>craziness that I,</v>

3579
02:34:44.581 --> 02:34:47.140
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have the time where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the mental bandwidth more</v>

3580
02:34:47.141 --> 02:34:47.590
<v Speaker 3>than anything else.</v>

3581
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot going on and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's been a little bit of a</v>

3582
02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:52.930
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3583
02:34:52.931 --> 02:34:56.680
<v Speaker 3>but that's just comes with the program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're thinking about</v>

3584
02:34:56.681 --> 02:34:58.210
<v Speaker 3>the numbers of people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaching.</v>

3585
02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever had to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like madmen magic.</v>

3586
02:35:00.161 --> 02:35:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Carson had a twitter account and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to interact with all the</v>

3587
02:35:03.101 --> 02:35:06.520
<v Speaker 3>fans where he got email carson tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.com and he's like,</v>

3588
02:35:06.521 --> 02:35:09.100
<v Speaker 3>did not know that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at all those fucking email.</v>

3589
02:35:09.101 --> 02:35:10.630
<v Speaker 3>How am I gonna respond to these people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't,</v>

3590
02:35:10.631 --> 02:35:11.620
<v Speaker 3>they get mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

3591
02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.520
<v Speaker 3>but this one good thing that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>is people don't expect you to do that</v>

3592
02:35:15.521 --> 02:35:19.030
<v Speaker 3>when you reach a certain number of fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I get way more,</v>

3593
02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:21.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>messages from people that say,</v>

3594
02:35:21.341 --> 02:35:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the podcast or a great job in the</v>

3595
02:35:24.011 --> 02:35:25.060
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

3596
02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:29.620
<v Speaker 3>That those kind of messages I get way</v>
<v Speaker 3>more often than someone actually trying</v>

3597
02:35:29.621 --> 02:35:33.150
<v Speaker 3>to get me to respond to things I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to do if I had,</v>

3598
02:35:33.151 --> 02:35:35.350
<v Speaker 3>I had that kind of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one has that kind of time.</v>

3599
02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:36.191
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3600
02:35:36.191 --> 02:35:39.610
<v Speaker 3>There's just a certain amount and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to combining public person and</v>

3601
02:35:39.970 --> 02:35:41.620
<v Speaker 3>private person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a certain amount of</v>

3602
02:35:41.621 --> 02:35:44.550
<v Speaker 3>bandwidth that your brain has that all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us have to do what,</v>

3603
02:35:44.551 --> 02:35:46.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

3604
02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:48.850
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two of us could sit here for 24</v>

3605
02:35:48.851 --> 02:35:51.070
<v Speaker 3>hours in a row and just respond to</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and blah,</v>

3606
02:35:51.071 --> 02:35:53.770
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like your brain also has to be</v>

3607
02:35:53.771 --> 02:35:56.380
<v Speaker 3>able to breathe well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your spirit has to be able to breathe,</v>

3608
02:35:56.381 --> 02:35:58.780
<v Speaker 3>you have to live life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think if you have anything to</v>

3609
02:35:58.781 --> 02:36:00.250
<v Speaker 3>offer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this one of the things that I'm</v>

3610
02:36:00.251 --> 02:36:02.730
<v Speaker 3>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of important to me and I've</v>

3611
02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:06.730
<v Speaker 3>tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to engineer this in my own</v>

3612
02:36:06.731 --> 02:36:10.030
<v Speaker 3>life in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I've got to have as much life</v>

3613
02:36:10.031 --> 02:36:15.031
<v Speaker 3>experiences or more than I do work</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like just working.</v>

3614
02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Like if I just did podcasts every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have things to say because</v>

3615
02:36:18.821 --> 02:36:20.110
<v Speaker 3>there's always something going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3616
02:36:20.410 --> 02:36:23.470
<v Speaker 3>But I think I wouldn't be doing my own</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

3617
02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:26.260
<v Speaker 3>a service I think to do my perspective</v>
<v Speaker 3>of serve it,</v>

3618
02:36:26.261 --> 02:36:28.060
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be honest about it.</v>

3619
02:36:28.061 --> 02:36:30.670
<v Speaker 3>I need to experience things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed to live life.</v>

3620
02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3621
02:36:32.270 --> 02:36:33.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel to places.</v>

3622
02:36:33.701 --> 02:36:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I needed to do things that are difficult</v>

3623
02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:38.110
<v Speaker 3>and I need to get involved in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>

3624
02:36:38.111 --> 02:36:41.770
<v Speaker 3>I like to do different things because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think first of all,</v>

3625
02:36:41.771 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 3>because I enjoy them first and foremost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think embracing that I enjoy them</v>

3626
02:36:45.641 --> 02:36:47.210
<v Speaker 3>benefits me and a great way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3627
02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Because when I do things that I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3628
02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I get happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I get happy,</v>

3629
02:36:50.261 --> 02:36:51.880
<v Speaker 3>I work better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3630
02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 3>And I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't do that and if I didn't like</v>

3631
02:36:56.411 --> 02:36:57.940
<v Speaker 3>actively seek out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would just,</v>

3632
02:36:57.941 --> 02:37:00.340
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people find this,</v>

3633
02:37:00.341 --> 02:37:04.000
<v Speaker 3>they get caught up in work so much that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all they focus on.</v>

3634
02:37:04.390 --> 02:37:08.410
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I think you stop being the person</v>

3635
02:37:08.411 --> 02:37:10.720
<v Speaker 3>who got to that position in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3636
02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:14.410
<v Speaker 3>The person who got to that position in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place got there because people</v>

3637
02:37:14.411 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 3>liked what you talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you thought</v>

3638
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:18.440
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the only way that even gets</v>

3639
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:21.560
<v Speaker 4>more enhanced is by experiencing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

3640
02:37:21.561 --> 02:37:22.820
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3641
02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:24.320
<v Speaker 4>across the world to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even,</v>

3642
02:37:24.321 --> 02:37:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I was telling you before we started</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>My fans are funding it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like my dreams literally are</v>

3646
02:37:30.621 --> 02:37:32.510
<v Speaker 4>becoming reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as you know,</v>

3647
02:37:32.511 --> 02:37:35.240
<v Speaker 4>like Dez validating as anything that has</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in my entire life.</v>

3648
02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3650

<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>

3652
02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yesterday I'm trying to hook up some</v>

3653
02:37:43.101 --> 02:37:47.000
<v Speaker 4>speakers in the house and I have some</v>
<v Speaker 4>old ass stereo that I've had forever and</v>

3654
02:37:47.001 --> 02:37:50.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to hook this shit up and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was driving me crazy,</v>

3655
02:37:50.421 --> 02:37:53.660
<v Speaker 4>but I actually halfway through after</v>
<v Speaker 4>like three hours of fucking pulling</v>

3656
02:37:53.661 --> 02:37:57.340
<v Speaker 4>things out of the wall and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old wire is the little metal ones</v>

3657
02:37:57.341 --> 02:38:02.341
<v Speaker 4>that you've got to turn and jamming them</v>
<v Speaker 4>into speakers and negative a twist and</v>

3658
02:38:03.940 --> 02:38:04.400
<v Speaker 4>the black thing.</v>

3659
02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.110
<v Speaker 4>And I'm jamming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's literally what I'm doing</v>

3660
02:38:06.111 --> 02:38:09.560
<v Speaker 4>yesterday and I'm frustrated as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then about halfway through I was</v>

3661
02:38:09.561 --> 02:38:11.300
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is actually great.</v>

3662
02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:15.200
<v Speaker 4>My attention was so focused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turning those things,</v>

3663
02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:17.090
<v Speaker 4>getting that thing in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling one out.</v>

3664
02:38:17.091 --> 02:38:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to run across the other and make</v>

3665
02:38:18.771 --> 02:38:21.500
<v Speaker 4>the speaker work and this one I have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>run outside and it's like,</v>

3666
02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:25.640
<v Speaker 4>that was actually great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a moment completely where I set</v>

3667
02:38:25.641 --> 02:38:27.470
<v Speaker 4>all my shit aside and I realized I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3668
02:38:27.471 --> 02:38:30.920
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the last hour I was fucking in this</v>

3669
02:38:30.921 --> 02:38:33.980
<v Speaker 4>shitty ass Yamaha Stereo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3670
02:38:35.050 --> 02:38:37.160
<v Speaker 4>And it was actually pretty great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3671
02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There really is.</v>

3672
02:38:38.751 --> 02:38:40.700
<v Speaker 4>So you don't have to go across the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>

3673
02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Just doing something that there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning in me doing it.</v>

3674
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:46.640
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to hire someone to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3675
02:38:46.641 --> 02:38:47.960
<v Speaker 4>like I want to figure this thing out.</v>

3676
02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:49.730
<v Speaker 4>And I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's definitely something to</v>

3677
02:38:49.731 --> 02:38:51.650
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I went to the Vatican this summer</v>

3678
02:38:51.651 --> 02:38:54.290
<v Speaker 4>and I think it was more fun than you</v>
<v Speaker 4>install on your stereo and I got to</v>

3679
02:38:54.310 --> 02:38:56.730
<v Speaker 4>learn more about people and looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3680
02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:01.130
<v Speaker 4>St Peter's basilica than I ever would've</v>
<v Speaker 4>done screwing together some fucking</v>

3681
02:39:01.131 --> 02:39:03.950
<v Speaker 4>wires and sticking them into some box</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes noise.</v>

3682
02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:06.800
<v Speaker 4>I Bet I can beat you on that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>many years ago,</v>

3683
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:09.080
<v Speaker 4>I believe around 97,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might have been the same trip</v>

3684
02:39:09.081 --> 02:39:12.020
<v Speaker 4>that I ended up in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to Amsterdam.</v>

3685
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:15.950
<v Speaker 4>I like basically shrooms for like eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>days and then we want it.</v>

3686
02:39:15.951 --> 02:39:18.290
<v Speaker 4>So my buddy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wanted to take that,</v>

3687
02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:22.390
<v Speaker 4>we wanted to take shrooms to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3688
02:39:22.430 --> 02:39:25.880
<v Speaker 4>to Rome to trip at the Sistine Chapel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So listen to this,</v>

3689
02:39:25.881 --> 02:39:26.900
<v Speaker 4>we get on the train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3690
02:39:26.901 --> 02:39:28.570
<v Speaker 4>it's like the overnight train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3691
02:39:28.571 --> 02:39:31.430
<v Speaker 4>probably 12 hours to go from Amsterdam</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Rome.</v>

3692
02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:34.760
<v Speaker 4>We got boarded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the train got boarded by like,</v>

3693
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:35.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

3694
02:39:35.961 --> 02:39:37.820
<v Speaker 4>like blush or police or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3695
02:39:37.821 --> 02:39:38.900
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were like,</v>

3696
02:39:38.930 --> 02:39:39.741
<v Speaker 4>what are we gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we do?</v>

3697
02:39:39.741 --> 02:39:42.700
<v Speaker 4>So we ate the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we literally ate the shrooms on the</v>

3698
02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:45.230
<v Speaker 4>trains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember like enough for one</v>

3699
02:39:45.231 --> 02:39:46.011
<v Speaker 4>person each,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3700
02:39:46.011 --> 02:39:47.300
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like a crazy amount,</v>

3701
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:50.090
<v Speaker 4>but we're on an overnight train in like</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those little cruise ships where</v>

3702
02:39:50.091 --> 02:39:51.710
<v Speaker 4>you're sleeping with two people above</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3703
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:54.430
<v Speaker 4>So we're both on the bottom in a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 4>little room with,</v>

3704
02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:58.580
<v Speaker 4>with four Italians tripping balls for</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours and hours and hours.</v>

3705
02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:03.260
<v Speaker 4>We get to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get to room and we went right to the</v>

3706
02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Sistine Chapel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you have to walk through like a</v>

3707
02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:06.810
<v Speaker 4>lot of other chapels kind of to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

3708
02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:10.430
<v Speaker 4>but so I wasn't fully tripping but I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>just enough,</v>

3709
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:13.100
<v Speaker 4>just enough in the Sistine Chapel beat</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3710
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Now you can't</v>

3711
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:15.880
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you only thing where you could do</v>

3712
02:40:15.881 --> 02:40:18.540
<v Speaker 2>that through four countries cause I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tripped through uh,</v>

3713
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:19.990
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tripped through bolt,</v>

3714
02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3715
02:40:22.350 --> 02:40:23.390
<v Speaker 2>something in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3716
02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:25.380
<v Speaker 2>there's another one in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else would be in there?</v>

3717
02:40:26.010 --> 02:40:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it all sounds Florence,</v>

3718
02:40:28.111 --> 02:40:29.520
<v Speaker 2>did you go to Florence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Florence,</v>

3719
02:40:29.521 --> 02:40:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3720
02:40:30.871 --> 02:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>You said something else in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>

3721
02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Belgium.</v>

3722
02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands is where I started with</v>
<v Speaker 2>things other than Italy.</v>

3723
02:40:36.691 --> 02:40:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you meant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I said.</v>

3724
02:40:38.941 --> 02:40:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but good time.</v>

3725
02:40:41.401 --> 02:40:42.660
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

3726
02:40:42.661 --> 02:40:45.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we visualizing just,</v>

3727
02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:47.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have just enough of the</v>

3728
02:40:47.161 --> 02:40:48.000
<v Speaker 2>visuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>

3729
02:40:48.001 --> 02:40:49.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3730
02:40:49.471 --> 02:40:53.130
<v Speaker 2>just a little something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was stone cold sober inside St Peter's</v>

3731
02:40:53.131 --> 02:40:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Basilica and I freaked out.</v>

3732
02:40:56.010 --> 02:40:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking about the sheer</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort involved in making something so</v>

3733
02:40:59.881 --> 02:41:03.630
<v Speaker 2>insanely huge and how many hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years it took to build it.</v>

3734
02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:07.380
<v Speaker 2>We had a great guide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really smart.</v>

3735
02:41:07.381 --> 02:41:11.040
<v Speaker 2>He was a professor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he spoke fluent English and fluent</v>

3736
02:41:11.041 --> 02:41:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Italian and he was a local professor who</v>
<v Speaker 2>did this on the side.</v>

3737
02:41:13.681 --> 02:41:18.450
<v Speaker 2>And when someone was like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic about the history of it,</v>

3738
02:41:18.451 --> 02:41:22.500
<v Speaker 2>he like lit up like a Christmas tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me and this guy had some awesome</v>

3739
02:41:22.501 --> 02:41:24.300
<v Speaker 2>conversations and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3740
02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:27.270
<v Speaker 2>he stuck with us for like our like five</v>
<v Speaker 2>or six hours.</v>

3741
02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Then we went to dinner with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and um,</v>

3742
02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:32.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just so,</v>

3743
02:41:32.191 --> 02:41:36.510
<v Speaker 2>he sold love the artwork and the culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the history of it.</v>

3744
02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:38.730
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so infectious when he was talking</v>

3745
02:41:38.731 --> 02:41:39.241
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3746
02:41:39.241 --> 02:41:39.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

3747
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:42.390
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be religious per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a believer.</v>

3748
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3749
02:41:43.981 --> 02:41:45.900
<v Speaker 2>I believe in things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be proven.</v>

3750
02:41:45.901 --> 02:41:47.340
<v Speaker 2>If someone could prove something to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

3751
02:41:47.370 --> 02:41:50.040
<v Speaker 2>then I would believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you told me that Lebron James dunked</v>

3752
02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:51.990
<v Speaker 2>from half court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'd need to see video.</v>

3753
02:41:51.991 --> 02:41:52.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would just,</v>

3754
02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did well,</v>

3755
02:41:53.641 --> 02:41:54.510
<v Speaker 2>hot damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3756
02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:58.110
<v Speaker 2>so why wouldn't I apply that same logic</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the biggest questions of the</v>

3757
02:41:58.111 --> 02:41:59.940
<v Speaker 2>universe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even not being a believer,</v>

3758
02:42:00.330 --> 02:42:03.510
<v Speaker 2>you can acknowledge that the work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people had to do,</v>

3759
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:08.010
<v Speaker 2>that maybe they felt some divine spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they felt something in themselves that I</v>

3760
02:42:08.011 --> 02:42:11.310
<v Speaker 2>can't explain or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's an incredible power to</v>

3761
02:42:11.311 --> 02:42:11.701
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3762
02:42:11.701 --> 02:42:13.250
<v Speaker 2>go to Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at the,</v>

3763
02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:15.390
<v Speaker 2>the Western Wall is literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3764
02:42:15.391 --> 02:42:18.270
<v Speaker 2>the holiest site in Judaism is adjacent</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Temple Mount.</v>

3765
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:20.550
<v Speaker 2>The Dome of the Rock is right on top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3766
02:42:20.551 --> 02:42:23.430
<v Speaker 2>The third holy site and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you walk five minutes the other</v>

3767
02:42:23.431 --> 02:42:25.020
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where</v>

3768
02:42:25.021 --> 02:42:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Jesus was crucified is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3769
02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.760
<v Speaker 2>so whether you believe in this stuff or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3770
02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:34.350
<v Speaker 2>it the fact the facts on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist and you have to acknowledge that</v>

3771
02:42:34.351 --> 02:42:37.110
<v Speaker 2>some people find meaning and value in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3772
02:42:37.111 --> 02:42:39.000
<v Speaker 2>And we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could argue whether that would have</v>

3773
02:42:39.001 --> 02:42:43.800
<v Speaker 2>been a destructive force throughout time</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I think a lot of ways religion is</v>

3774
02:42:43.801 --> 02:42:45.930
<v Speaker 2>like bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>

3775
02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:49.740
<v Speaker 2>It's helped people and it's hurt a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3776
02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:52.590
<v Speaker 2>religion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or been responsible for some horrible</v>

3777
02:42:52.591 --> 02:42:54.780
<v Speaker 2>trustees and not just one religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like many,</v>

3778
02:42:54.781 --> 02:42:56.490
<v Speaker 2>many religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like many,</v>

3779
02:42:56.491 --> 02:43:00.330
<v Speaker 2>many groups of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many groups that have influencing great</v>

3780
02:43:00.331 --> 02:43:02.790
<v Speaker 2>influence over people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they look out for</v>

3781
02:43:02.791 --> 02:43:04.920
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they protect themselves ruthlessly,</v>

3782
02:43:04.921 --> 02:43:06.840
<v Speaker 2>especially when they have massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of power.</v>

3783
02:43:06.841 --> 02:43:08.070
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3784
02:43:08.290 --> 02:43:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Like when you look at any sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3785
02:43:12.670 --> 02:43:16.210
<v Speaker 3>any side of a coup or any sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>usurping of power,</v>

3786
02:43:16.390 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 3>like it's someone who has massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>amounts of power and someone else wants</v>

3787
02:43:19.601 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 3>that massive amounts of power and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>conquer him and takeover and it's always</v>

3788
02:43:23.921 --> 02:43:27.130
<v Speaker 3>like this spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaotic event.</v>

3789
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's what human beings sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do.</v>

3790
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.561
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3791
02:43:32.561 --> 02:43:36.490
<v Speaker 3>they established positions of power than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the abused them and they're almost</v>

3792
02:43:36.491 --> 02:43:39.430
<v Speaker 3>begging for some better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter person to come along and take it</v>

3793
02:43:39.431 --> 02:43:42.190
<v Speaker 3>from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about that sometimes even when</v>

3794
02:43:42.191 --> 02:43:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like walking where I used to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in west Hollywood where it's like</v>

3795
02:43:44.831 --> 02:43:46.000
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3796
02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:47.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's next to beverly hills,</v>

3797
02:43:47.350 --> 02:43:50.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a nice area and that all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are sort of walking,</v>

3798
02:43:50.231 --> 02:43:52.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nice shops there and everyone</v>

3799
02:43:52.871 --> 02:43:54.660
<v Speaker 3>kind of looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of where he's at.</v>

3800
02:43:54.661 --> 02:43:56.230
<v Speaker 3>But when they go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tan,</v>

3801
02:43:56.231 --> 02:43:58.300
<v Speaker 3>they get surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3802
02:43:58.301 --> 02:43:59.920
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all working on themselves all</v>

3803
02:43:59.921 --> 02:44:01.960
<v Speaker 3>day doing their own thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're right,</v>

3804
02:44:01.961 --> 02:44:05.110
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so blind to the fact that there</v>

3805
02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:06.460
<v Speaker 3>is something else happening.</v>

3806
02:44:06.490 --> 02:44:11.050
<v Speaker 3>There is a real power play happening in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world where there are forces that</v>

3807
02:44:11.051 --> 02:44:14.110
<v Speaker 3>want to change things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either for what may be better for you</v>

3808
02:44:14.111 --> 02:44:15.670
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or worst for you or whatever.</v>

3809
02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:20.710
<v Speaker 3>And most people just ignore it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot easier to get lost in twitter</v>

3810
02:44:20.711 --> 02:44:22.870
<v Speaker 3>or watch the Kardashians or country</v>
<v Speaker 3>clubs,</v>

3811
02:44:22.871 --> 02:44:24.490
<v Speaker 3>the kids of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we are.</v>

3812
02:44:24.491 --> 02:44:27.610
<v Speaker 3>We're just spoiled country club kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world that don't realize the</v>

3813
02:44:27.611 --> 02:44:32.470
<v Speaker 3>consequences of flying drones in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yemen and bombing wedding parties,</v>

3814
02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:34.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like the,</v>

3815
02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:36.490
<v Speaker 3>the consequence that's attached to those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3816
02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:39.970
<v Speaker 3>It would be so significant it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening on this patch of dirt,</v>

3817
02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but since it's happening over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't think of it as a big a deal.</v>

3818
02:44:43.390 --> 02:44:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine what would happen if</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone from another country had flown a</v>

3819
02:44:46.751 --> 02:44:50.230
<v Speaker 3>drone over the United States and</v>
<v Speaker 3>accidentally bombed some sort of a</v>

3820
02:44:50.231 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 3>wedding party in Phoenix?</v>

3821
02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you fucking imagine,</v>

3822
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:56.830
<v Speaker 3>imagine if a one rocket flew over</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans,</v>

3823
02:44:56.860 --> 02:45:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Mexico's border to a hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Passover,</v>

3824
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:02.110
<v Speaker 3>a La Jolla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We bomb Canada.</v>

3825
02:45:02.111 --> 02:45:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like think about that.</v>

3826
02:45:05.891 --> 02:45:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Like it's so crazy when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3827
02:45:08.621 --> 02:45:09.730
<v Speaker 3>and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said before,</v>

3828
02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:14.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not against every state secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that some shit has,</v>

3829
02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:18.000
<v Speaker 3>there are rules that are beyond what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>average time of day.</v>

3830
02:45:18.010 --> 02:45:21.760
<v Speaker 3>They're only that way because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>transparency in these other countries</v>

3831
02:45:21.761 --> 02:45:22.541
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3832
02:45:22.541 --> 02:45:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Once all these countries develop this</v>
<v Speaker 3>new level of transparency where you</v>

3833
02:45:26.621 --> 02:45:28.420
<v Speaker 3>can't hide shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't lie.</v>

3834
02:45:28.660 --> 02:45:30.160
<v Speaker 3>You're going to do one or two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to say,</v>

3835
02:45:30.161 --> 02:45:31.140
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Gaviscon,</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to put in the whole thing.</v>

3837
02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Putin is doing right now is old</v>

3838

3853
02:46:05.411 --> 02:46:07.750
<v Speaker 3>watch this car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the guy in the middle is doing that</v>

3854
02:46:07.751 --> 02:46:09.620
<v Speaker 3>so he could hit Putin's caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

3855
02:46:09.890 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

3856
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:12.710
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knew where the car was and he drove</v>

3857
02:46:12.711 --> 02:46:16.010
<v Speaker 5>in the median and then turn towards</v>
<v Speaker 5>Putin's car.</v>

3858
02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:17.980
<v Speaker 5>We tried to tell him one more time real</v>
<v Speaker 5>quick,</v>

3859
02:46:17.981 --> 02:46:20.600
<v Speaker 5>now that I can see it right now I see</v>
<v Speaker 5>the front part to watch the median.</v>

3860
02:46:20.601 --> 02:46:22.140
<v Speaker 5>What's the middle strip?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy is,</v>

3861
02:46:22.141 --> 02:46:24.860
<v Speaker 5>they're planning this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he sees the car and turns right</v>

3862
02:46:24.861 --> 02:46:27.380
<v Speaker 5>into a holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit is right.</v>

3863
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:31.550
<v Speaker 5>It killed the driver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it killed both guys.</v>

3864
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:35.120
<v Speaker 5>See if we kill both guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Putin was not in that car,</v>

3865
02:46:35.121 --> 02:46:36.170
<v Speaker 5>but that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3866
02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:39.560
<v Speaker 5>his favorite driver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking bananas.</v>

3867
02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:41.930
<v Speaker 5>So I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's game of thrones.</v>

3868
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:43.220
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's to the point.</v>

3869
02:46:43.221 --> 02:46:45.260
<v Speaker 5>This is very modern game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

3870
02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:45.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3871
02:46:45.741 --> 02:46:49.700
<v Speaker 5>but all these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are the people that are protected</v>

3872
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:54.140
<v Speaker 5>by the dark lords that run the kingdom</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that this is just the modern version</v>

3873
02:46:54.141 --> 02:46:56.210
<v Speaker 5>of shit that's been going on since the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning of time.</v>

3874
02:46:56.210 --> 02:46:59.420
<v Speaker 5>So then that said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does that give you any empathy for what</v>

3875
02:46:59.421 --> 02:47:02.000
<v Speaker 5>Clinton has to do to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I'm saying.</v>

3876
02:47:02.001 --> 02:47:03.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily empathy,</v>

3877
02:47:03.471 --> 02:47:08.240
<v Speaker 5>but a vague understanding of how</v>
<v Speaker 5>ignorant I am about how the world works.</v>

3878
02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:11.840
<v Speaker 5>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird place to sit,</v>

3879
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:13.250
<v Speaker 5>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3880
02:47:13.251 --> 02:47:17.180
<v Speaker 5>here's the defense of Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the major Clinton dot bill because,</v>

3881
02:47:17.181 --> 02:47:19.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a defense of whatever he may or may</v>

3882
02:47:19.821 --> 02:47:20.850
<v Speaker 5>not have done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3883
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:23.510
<v Speaker 5>physically to all those people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>accusing him of things,</v>

3884
02:47:23.810 --> 02:47:27.080
<v Speaker 5>but about his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the speeches that he does and all</v>

3885
02:47:27.081 --> 02:47:31.100
<v Speaker 5>the money that he's trying to acquire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People forget how ruthlessly prosecuted</v>

3886
02:47:31.101 --> 02:47:33.950
<v Speaker 5>he was my Kenneth Star while he was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>office.</v>

3887
02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:36.740
<v Speaker 5>And how crazy that all that all that</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation was.</v>

3888
02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:38.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was leading it?</v>

3889
02:47:38.541 --> 02:47:40.010
<v Speaker 5>Newt Gingrich,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who as we said before,</v>

3890
02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:42.320
<v Speaker 5>it was having an affair off his wife</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was dying.</v>

3891
02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:43.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there was another guy,</v>

3892
02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:45.800
<v Speaker 5>the strategist who's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3893
02:47:45.801 --> 02:47:48.200
<v Speaker 5>the Republican strategist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was Ken Mehlman.</v>

3894
02:47:48.201 --> 02:47:48.831
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was after,</v>

3895
02:47:48.831 --> 02:47:49.940
<v Speaker 5>that was the George W.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bush guy.</v>

3896
02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:51.133
<v Speaker 5>Rove?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3897
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:53.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Call Ralf Karl Rove is about part of it</v>

3898
02:47:53.451 --> 02:47:53.841
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3899
02:47:53.841 --> 02:47:55.760
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't he partially involved Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing?</v>

3900
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'm confusing cause Karl Rove is</v>

3901
02:47:58.791 --> 02:48:00.380
<v Speaker 5>definitely a part of the Jeff Gannon</v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

3902
02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3903
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:05.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that could have</v>

3904
02:48:05.091 --> 02:48:08.240
<v Speaker 5>possibly been like for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know that when Bill Clinton got</v>

3905
02:48:08.241 --> 02:48:11.090
<v Speaker 5>out of office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently he was deeply in debt because</v>

3906
02:48:11.091 --> 02:48:13.640
<v Speaker 5>of his legal fees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the whole thing was just like off</v>

3907
02:48:13.641 --> 02:48:15.350
<v Speaker 5>the chart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the things that Hillary</v>

3908
02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:18.050
<v Speaker 5>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she had said that when they left,</v>

3909
02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:19.610
<v Speaker 5>when he left the office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were dead broke.</v>

3910
02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Well he obviously found ways to</v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalize on it and did it.</v>

3911
02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:26.570
<v Speaker 5>But could you imagine being a guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a former president and is,</v>

3912
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:30.230
<v Speaker 5>how old was he at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe in his late fifties and</v>

3913
02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:34.490
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just dead broke but beaten down by</v>

3914
02:48:34.491 --> 02:48:36.760
<v Speaker 5>public scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you are,</v>

3915
02:48:36.761 --> 02:48:41.030
<v Speaker 5>you're in debt to the tune of who knows</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many dollars and you've lost all</v>

3916
02:48:41.031 --> 02:48:44.060
<v Speaker 5>your money to legal cases cause you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting off impeachment by all these</v>

3917
02:48:44.061 --> 02:48:48.140
<v Speaker 5>crazy people that want to prosecute you</v>
<v Speaker 5>for doing shit that pretty much every</v>

3918
02:48:48.141 --> 02:48:50.000
<v Speaker 5>president has done since the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 5>of time,</v>

3919
02:48:50.001 --> 02:48:52.220
<v Speaker 5>whipped his dick out and people just</v>
<v Speaker 5>start sucking it because they're the</v>

3920
02:48:52.221 --> 02:48:54.350
<v Speaker 5>fucking king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's crazy to be in that position</v>

3921
02:48:54.351 --> 02:48:56.570
<v Speaker 5>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who Cares?</v>

3922
02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:00.050
<v Speaker 5>Well people should care because he lied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you raped people or whatever,</v>

3923
02:49:00.051 --> 02:49:01.730
<v Speaker 5>then that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm just going to just the general,</v>

3924
02:49:01.731 --> 02:49:04.190
<v Speaker 5>if the president's having affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who gives a fuck?</v>

3925
02:49:04.310 --> 02:49:07.650
<v Speaker 5>Is the country working?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it this thing basically not going</v>

3926
02:49:07.651 --> 02:49:09.510
<v Speaker 5>towards the iceberg then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3927
02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.740
<v Speaker 5>But here's where it's curious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't get prosecuted because he lied</v>

3928
02:49:13.770 --> 02:49:18.420
<v Speaker 5>because obviously Obama now we don't now</v>
<v Speaker 5>found out that he lied about the emails</v>

3929
02:49:18.421 --> 02:49:21.000
<v Speaker 5>from the wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He lied to the American people.</v>

3930
02:49:21.001 --> 02:49:23.910
<v Speaker 5>It is a small lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a white lie I guess you could say</v>

3931
02:49:23.911 --> 02:49:25.220
<v Speaker 5>cause nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3932
02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:28.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean might not be the worst luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama's wasn't under oath.</v>

3933
02:49:28.021 --> 02:49:29.800
<v Speaker 5>Clinton's was exactly that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get to.</v>

3934
02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:35.060
<v Speaker 5>But the difference being that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>raise his hand and put his hand on the</v>

3935
02:49:35.071 --> 02:49:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Bible and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you solemnly swear to tell the truth?</v>

3936
02:49:38.671 --> 02:49:41.220
<v Speaker 5>Like why you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to,</v>

3937
02:49:41.221 --> 02:49:43.800
<v Speaker 5>I have to know your really honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like now,</v>

3938
02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:47.220
<v Speaker 5>like this is the time where you can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>lie anymore.</v>

3939
02:49:47.221 --> 02:49:51.390
<v Speaker 5>So we have this crazy rule that if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do lie during that time,</v>

3940
02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:56.540
<v Speaker 5>it's so different than when you lie</v>
<v Speaker 5>about what FBI Administrator Komi or</v>

3941
02:49:56.701 --> 02:49:57.730
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck his title is.</v>

3942
02:49:57.730 --> 02:49:58.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Comb.</v>

3943
02:49:58.330 --> 02:50:01.470
<v Speaker 5>He says about what you did and versus</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you think you did.</v>

3944
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:04.320
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or whether it's who knows what other</v>

3945
02:50:04.321 --> 02:50:07.080
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's how many fucking cell phone</v>

3946
02:50:07.081 --> 02:50:11.550
<v Speaker 5>she had or Ben Gazi or what are those</v>
<v Speaker 5>lines where you have your team destroy</v>

3947
02:50:11.551 --> 02:50:14.170
<v Speaker 5>all your old devices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Hammers and I had a team,</v>

3948
02:50:14.730 --> 02:50:16.290
<v Speaker 5>we actually did take some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3949
02:50:16.291 --> 02:50:19.170
<v Speaker 5>old hard drives out to the gun range.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3950
02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:19.900
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3951
02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:22.800
<v Speaker 5>I put some 300 win mag rounds into him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'll,</v>

3952
02:50:23.220 --> 02:50:26.430
<v Speaker 5>that'll show him who's boss cause we</v>
<v Speaker 5>were going to get rid of him anyway.</v>

3953
02:50:26.431 --> 02:50:28.440
<v Speaker 5>They were old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is old bullshit.</v>

3954
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:30.420
<v Speaker 5>I said it'd be fun to take these to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>range.</v>

3955
02:50:30.421 --> 02:50:33.450
<v Speaker 5>Just blow them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say I said we took them out there and I</v>

3956
02:50:33.451 --> 02:50:36.690
<v Speaker 5>was siting in my rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

3957
02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:38.760
<v Speaker 5>Should see what it does to one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to try that.</v>

3958
02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.500
<v Speaker 5>You would like to try that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would do that with you sometime</v>

3959
02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:45.210
<v Speaker 5>computers or you have some old laptops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I did today?</v>

3960
02:50:45.570 --> 02:50:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got off the apple tip.</v>

3961
02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:50.400
<v Speaker 5>I got my apple laptop here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I bought a windows laptop just to</v>

3962
02:50:50.401 --> 02:50:52.800
<v Speaker 5>see what's going on a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes they do.</v>

3963
02:50:52.830 --> 02:50:55.680
<v Speaker 5>They make a Lenovo thinkpad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3964
02:50:55.681 --> 02:50:57.450
<v Speaker 5>that's what I got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like think pads.</v>

3965
02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:00.720
<v Speaker 5>I had one a long time ago and I'm so</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's see what the newest thinkpads look</v>

3966
02:51:00.721 --> 02:51:01.111
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3967
02:51:01.111 --> 02:51:02.430
<v Speaker 5>I still had that little red.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3968
02:51:02.431 --> 02:51:04.650
<v Speaker 5>the little nipple that you play with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that thing.</v>

3969
02:51:05.010 --> 02:51:06.620
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have the nipple still.</v>

3970
02:51:06.690 --> 02:51:07.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3971
02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:10.950
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a p 50 Lenovo thinkpad p 50.</v>

3972
02:51:10.951 --> 02:51:13.530
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get this thing pad and it has windows</v>

3973
02:51:13.531 --> 02:51:14.071
<v Speaker 5>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3974
02:51:14.071 --> 02:51:18.150
<v Speaker 5>the newest windows is windows 10.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I try upgrading to windows 10.</v>

3975
02:51:18.210 --> 02:51:21.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three and a half hours later after to</v>

3976
02:51:21.601 --> 02:51:25.410
<v Speaker 5>fucking live chats with people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't figure out how to get it to</v>

3977
02:51:25.411 --> 02:51:28.640
<v Speaker 5>work to different people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking to um,</v>

3978
02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:29.391
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3979
02:51:29.391 --> 02:51:30.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tech support.</v>

3980
02:51:30.211 --> 02:51:31.350
<v Speaker 5>They can't figure out how to get it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

3981
02:51:31.351 --> 02:51:34.740
<v Speaker 5>It's still got windows seven on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I spent three and a half hours this</v>

3982
02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:37.180
<v Speaker 5>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as therapeutic as my little Yamaha</v>

3983
02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:37.860
<v Speaker 5>stretches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

3984
02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:40.370
<v Speaker 5>I didn't lose my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't lose my temper because I</v>

3985
02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:41.850
<v Speaker 5>treated it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a laptop.</v>

3986
02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:46.380
<v Speaker 5>This one's getting kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got a lot of space taken up by porn</v>

3987
02:51:46.590 --> 02:51:50.760
<v Speaker 5>and stupid shit and I'm fucking pool</v>
<v Speaker 5>videos and a bunch of dumb stuff on my</v>

3988
02:51:50.761 --> 02:51:52.990
<v Speaker 5>phone from my phone rather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was saying,</v>

3989
02:51:52.991 --> 02:51:55.350
<v Speaker 5>and why I should probably get like a new</v>
<v Speaker 5>laptop,</v>

3990
02:51:55.351 --> 02:51:57.120
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't I see what windows 10 is like?</v>

3991
02:51:57.300 --> 02:51:59.470
<v Speaker 5>So I figure if you buy a new laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3992
02:51:59.471 --> 02:52:01.260
<v Speaker 5>for sure it's going to have windows 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>

3993
02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:05.850
<v Speaker 5>No one had fucking windows seven windows</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven an</v>

3994
02:52:06.310 --> 02:52:09.580
<v Speaker 2>eight nine I didn't know that they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything after 95 I thought it was</v>

3995
02:52:09.581 --> 02:52:12.850
<v Speaker 2>windows 95 and then that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard windows 10 is good.</v>

3996
02:52:12.851 --> 02:52:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it reviewed by a tech people,</v>

3997
02:52:15.011 --> 02:52:17.050
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping to see what the fuss is all</v>

3998
02:52:17.051 --> 02:52:17.884
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've been,</v>

3999
02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be like,</v>

4000
02:52:21.490 --> 02:52:26.200
<v Speaker 2>like going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to a really shitty job for a while</v>

4001
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:28.780
<v Speaker 2>and then coming back to your regular job</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>

4002
02:52:28.781 --> 02:52:32.300
<v Speaker 2>God is so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny how sometimes like if</v>

4003
02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:35.920
<v Speaker 2>we're as connected as you may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes some technology just kind of</v>

4004
02:52:35.921 --> 02:52:38.740
<v Speaker 2>gets passed you and then you realize you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like miss something.</v>

4005
02:52:38.741 --> 02:52:42.040
<v Speaker 2>So for the last five years I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>using firefox,</v>

4006
02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:44.440
<v Speaker 2>the browser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firefox,</v>

4007
02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you're on chrome I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4008
02:52:46.110 --> 02:52:48.250
<v Speaker 2>So I'm using firefox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing would work.</v>

4009
02:52:48.251 --> 02:52:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Like things like videos would freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audio would freeze.</v>

4010
02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't open three windows at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4011
02:52:52.871 --> 02:52:54.850
<v Speaker 2>like whole bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then my,</v>

4012
02:52:54.851 --> 02:52:55.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my director were,</v>

4013
02:52:55.921 --> 02:52:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Mira saw me clicking firefox and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

4014
02:52:58.691 --> 02:53:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's 23 or 24.</v>

4015
02:53:00.191 --> 02:53:03.040
<v Speaker 2>And she was laughing hysterically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking idiot.</v>

4016
02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.800
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing that?</v>

4017
02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get on chrome.</v>

4018
02:53:08.530 --> 02:53:09.161
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4019
02:53:09.161 --> 02:53:10.990
<v Speaker 2>that can't be any different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>firefox.</v>

4020
02:53:10.991 --> 02:53:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I thought everybody was on firefox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for as much as I'm in this thing,</v>

4021
02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:15.131
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

4022
02:53:15.131 --> 02:53:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I got on firefox and I just was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chrome is the shit.</v>

4023
02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:19.420
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm on chrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guess what,</v>

4024
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you press play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens?</v>

4025
02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Shit plays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she plays.</v>

4026
02:53:22.270 --> 02:53:22.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4027
02:53:22.601 --> 02:53:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer in the Google and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that I've been thinking</v>

4028
02:53:25.691 --> 02:53:26.524
<v Speaker 2>about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4029
02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:28.780
<v Speaker 2>getting off the apple tit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4030
02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:31.780
<v Speaker 2>using an android phone and a windows</v>
<v Speaker 2>laptop.</v>

4031
02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:33.760
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to try that over the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>few months.</v>

4032
02:53:33.820 --> 02:53:36.100
<v Speaker 2>This is the beginning of the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

4033
02:53:36.460 --> 02:53:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think being frustrated be such a</v>

4034
02:53:38.501 --> 02:53:39.490
<v Speaker 2>bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4035
02:53:39.491 --> 02:53:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I think at the very least I can call</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on good dude.</v>

4036
02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could send you a text</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

4037
02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Something's going on and send me</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

4038
02:53:45.131 --> 02:53:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't find him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way to get off the grid.</v>

4039
02:53:47.561 --> 02:53:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard when people say the pictures on</v>

4040
02:53:49.841 --> 02:53:52.150
<v Speaker 2>those google phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they go into a folder,</v>

4041
02:53:52.660 --> 02:53:55.990
<v Speaker 2>like if someone sends you a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's attached to your text message.</v>

4042
02:53:55.991 --> 02:53:59.560
<v Speaker 2>That picture like automatically goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a folder and may not even exist on</v>

4043
02:53:59.561 --> 02:54:02.110
<v Speaker 2>the tech stream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't get it.</v>

4044
02:54:02.170 --> 02:54:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4045
02:54:03.361 --> 02:54:05.110
<v Speaker 2>even live like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find out,</v>

4046
02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:05.944
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find out.</v>

4047
02:54:06.130 --> 02:54:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what's going on.</v>

4048
02:54:07.481 --> 02:54:08.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a,</v>

4049
02:54:08.261 --> 02:54:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Google has a new phone called the Google</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google Pixel heard about it and it's</v>

4050
02:54:12.131 --> 02:54:15.970
<v Speaker 2>very highly received by tech dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that really know what the</v>

4051
02:54:15.971 --> 02:54:18.550
<v Speaker 2>fuck they're talking about unlike me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they uh,</v>

4052
02:54:18.580 --> 02:54:21.400
<v Speaker 2>they really liked the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like the speed,</v>

4053
02:54:21.401 --> 02:54:24.250
<v Speaker 2>the pure google experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody fucks with it.</v>

4054
02:54:24.450 --> 02:54:27.040
<v Speaker 2>It comes straight from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a third party software</v>

4055
02:54:27.041 --> 02:54:29.590
<v Speaker 2>built into it so I'm going to say let's</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what's going on.</v>

4056
02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think if you just stay on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple tit all the time,</v>

4057
02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:35.170
<v Speaker 2>like when people send me a text message</v>
<v Speaker 2>is all green,</v>

4058
02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I can a little envy like this person is</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and just rebelling.</v>

4059
02:54:38.770 --> 02:54:41.580
<v Speaker 2>They're out there and be wild and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending text messages.</v>

4060
02:54:41.581 --> 02:54:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Now this morning when I was dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Yamaha show you,</v>

4061
02:54:45.731 --> 02:54:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See I'm just a real big fan of Google in</v>

4062
02:54:48.971 --> 02:54:52.810
<v Speaker 2>general took a picture of a wire and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back green and I thought what's</v>

4063
02:54:52.811 --> 02:54:54.160
<v Speaker 2>this guy know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4064
02:54:54.250 --> 02:54:57.760
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows he knows things or he doesn't</v>

4065
02:54:57.761 --> 02:54:59.290
<v Speaker 2>or he's poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor guy.</v>

4066
02:54:59.350 --> 02:55:01.630
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very sad.</v>

4067
02:55:01.631 --> 02:55:04.340
<v Speaker 2>It could be that he's just a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't trust apple,</v>

4068
02:55:04.610 --> 02:55:06.410
<v Speaker 3>but there is something fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

4069
02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Those blue things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if someone's got another kind</v>

4070
02:55:09.771 --> 02:55:12.170
<v Speaker 3>of phone then it's Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like oh they're an outsider.</v>

4071
02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:15.680
<v Speaker 3>It's green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't even send you a blue one.</v>

4072
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have different fucking</v>

4073
02:55:17.331 --> 02:55:19.430
<v Speaker 3>collars for different people that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>different phones?</v>

4074
02:55:19.431 --> 02:55:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the word where that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the other ones that feel it's that</v>

4075
02:55:22.791 --> 02:55:26.930
<v Speaker 3>1984 commercial that apple did in 1984</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were fighting windows at the</v>

4076
02:55:26.931 --> 02:55:30.620
<v Speaker 3>time they were fighting Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that the bigger my apple</v>

4077
02:55:30.621 --> 02:55:33.410
<v Speaker 3>gets and the more we just instinctively</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to it.</v>

4078
02:55:33.411 --> 02:55:35.480
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say this with all due irony because I</v>

4079
02:55:35.481 --> 02:55:37.070
<v Speaker 3>got the iphone seven the day it came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

4080
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4081
02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:43.040
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more that we all do that you</v>

4082
02:55:43.041 --> 02:55:46.810
<v Speaker 3>actually incentivize them to not</v>
<v Speaker 3>innovate because if they know that if,</v>

4083
02:55:46.910 --> 02:55:48.920
<v Speaker 3>cause this phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really the reality is that this phone</v>

4084
02:55:48.921 --> 02:55:51.740
<v Speaker 3>that we're both have right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it barely is different than the,</v>

4085
02:55:51.770 --> 02:55:52.340
<v Speaker 3>than the six.</v>

4086
02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you finding it?</v>

4087
02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:57.560
<v Speaker 3>But who are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been talking for awhile.</v>

4088
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:59.540
<v Speaker 3>A little better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little better,</v>

4089
02:55:59.570 --> 02:56:03.470
<v Speaker 3>but maybe a little worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the annoying Shin and I do miss</v>

4090
02:56:03.471 --> 02:56:05.220
<v Speaker 3>the phone and the headphone Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4091
02:56:05.270 --> 02:56:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I want to have a headphone</v>

4092
02:56:06.801 --> 02:56:10.790
<v Speaker 3>plugged in while I'm in my car so I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to someone with a thing dangling</v>

4093
02:56:10.791 --> 02:56:14.590
<v Speaker 3>from my ear because it's way easier to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear them that it is through speaker</v>

4094
02:56:14.591 --> 02:56:17.210
<v Speaker 3>phone or what if you want to charge your</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and use headphones.</v>

4095
02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't agree with what they're</v>

4096
02:56:20.571 --> 02:56:23.840
<v Speaker 3>doing with laptops either where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting rid of USB and they have,</v>

4097
02:56:23.841 --> 02:56:26.360
<v Speaker 3>now they have some new type of Usb like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man,</v>

4098
02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:29.360
<v Speaker 3>this isn't any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is that goes to my point.</v>

4099
02:56:29.361 --> 02:56:31.730
<v Speaker 3>If they know that you're going to buy</v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit no matter what,</v>

4100
02:56:31.731 --> 02:56:34.010
<v Speaker 3>and they know us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew the day they put this out,</v>

4101
02:56:34.011 --> 02:56:36.470
<v Speaker 3>they're going to make x amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of dollars if not</v>

4102
02:56:36.471 --> 02:56:37.040
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

4103
02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.130
<v Speaker 3>So the more that we all instinctively</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go to them,</v>

4104
02:56:40.370 --> 02:56:44.150
<v Speaker 3>the actual less they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's less incentive for them to give</v>

4105
02:56:44.151 --> 02:56:48.330
<v Speaker 3>us good innovative shit because why keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing it if you just tweak a couple</v>

4106
02:56:48.331 --> 02:56:50.900
<v Speaker 3>of things and they don't put that much</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it and we all do it anyway.</v>

4107
02:56:51.050 --> 02:56:56.050
<v Speaker 3>I also think that it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>important to support competition and to,</v>

4108
02:56:56.660 --> 02:56:57.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

4109
02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:01.790
<v Speaker 3>I think once they reach a point where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tech people are saying this is the</v>

4110
02:57:01.791 --> 02:57:03.770
<v Speaker 3>best phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of the Google,</v>

4111
02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:06.530
<v Speaker 3>the people that have a reviewed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google Pixel,</v>

4112
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:08.870
<v Speaker 3>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have ditched my iphone for this is the</v>

4113
02:57:08.871 --> 02:57:12.140
<v Speaker 3>best phone in the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally for the first time an android</v>

4114
02:57:12.141 --> 02:57:14.150
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're rooting for</v>

4115
02:57:14.210 --> 02:57:17.000
<v Speaker 3>android and so they may have a biased</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

4116
02:57:17.170 --> 02:57:17.880
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my tribe,</v>

4117
02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:19.460
<v Speaker 3>like these guys are out of their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

4118
02:57:19.490 --> 02:57:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we're gonna find out,</v>

4119
02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find out about windows 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to find out about android.</v>

4120
02:57:23.661 --> 02:57:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to give them both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A shot decided that recently I was like,</v>

4121
02:57:26.541 --> 02:57:29.720
<v Speaker 3>this is just too instinctive a move for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me to just go to apple.</v>

4122
02:57:30.430 --> 02:57:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember when I was on news</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio,</v>

4123
02:57:32.390 --> 02:57:33.980
<v Speaker 3>it's when apple wasn't really even that</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

4124
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:38.780
<v Speaker 3>It was before m o s 10 osx rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the big operating system</v>

4125
02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:43.100
<v Speaker 3>change where it went to unix based</v>
<v Speaker 3>system opposed to the way it was before.</v>

4126
02:57:43.101 --> 02:57:47.090
<v Speaker 3>It was like it would freeze up before it</v>
<v Speaker 3>had no memory protection.</v>

4127
02:57:47.091 --> 02:57:49.290
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't really multitask correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>

4128
02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:51.560
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have what they call preemptive</v>
<v Speaker 3>multitasking.</v>

4129
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:54.250
<v Speaker 3>So like the tech people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate the,</v>

4130
02:57:54.251 --> 02:57:59.251
<v Speaker 3>the Mac platform until Osx and then Osx</v>
<v Speaker 3>had this really like responsive user</v>

4131
02:57:59.511 --> 02:58:01.890
<v Speaker 3>interface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very cool little animation things</v>

4132
02:58:01.891 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 3>would</v>

4133
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:04.260
<v Speaker 2>happen when you click on things and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw that and what,</v>

4134
02:58:04.261 --> 02:58:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay I want to try it,</v>

4135
02:58:06.180 --> 02:58:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went,</v>

4136
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:10.440
<v Speaker 2>that's when I jumped back over from</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows to Mac again.</v>

4137
02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many people that get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these clans.</v>

4138
02:58:14.370 --> 02:58:16.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like we were talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans versus Democrats.</v>

4139
02:58:16.950 --> 02:58:19.890
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of clans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was on the set of news</v>

4140
02:58:19.891 --> 02:58:21.120
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys,</v>

4141
02:58:21.121 --> 02:58:23.940
<v Speaker 2>this is back when Max sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys just like,</v>

4142
02:58:23.941 --> 02:58:25.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4143
02:58:25.081 --> 02:58:26.550
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you hear our sales are up,</v>

4144
02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:28.770
<v Speaker 2>our sales are up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's talking about like Max,</v>

4145
02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I go our sales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like sounds of Matt.</v>

4146
02:58:31.230 --> 02:58:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew he was a man.</v>

4147
02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:35.010
<v Speaker 2>He'd have where apple t shirts and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was such a,</v>

4148
02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs was the key grip on a news</v>

4149
02:58:39.310 --> 02:58:39.760
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>

4150
02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:40.561
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4151
02:58:40.561 --> 02:58:42.390
<v Speaker 2>he's a creative guy behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

4152
02:58:42.391 --> 02:58:46.050
<v Speaker 2>but he was like so excited about apple</v>
<v Speaker 2>sales being up.</v>

4153
02:58:46.051 --> 02:58:46.650
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4154
02:58:46.650 --> 02:58:48.450
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting weird with me.</v>

4155
02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You know we've got new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new Mac.</v>

4156
02:58:50.521 --> 02:58:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Books are coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4157
02:58:52.380 --> 02:58:54.150
<v Speaker 2>don't you have a computer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck are we doing?</v>

4158
02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:57.720
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We become slaves to these machine.</v>

4159
02:58:57.721 --> 02:58:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it was like apple was the</v>

4160
02:58:59.791 --> 02:59:01.620
<v Speaker 2>underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different experience.</v>

4161
02:59:01.621 --> 02:59:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That 1984 commercial,</v>

4162
02:59:03.301 --> 02:59:08.250
<v Speaker 2>their whole point was you all bow down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Microsoft and we are the upstarts.</v>

4163
02:59:08.251 --> 02:59:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Where are the people that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>break the system?</v>

4164
02:59:10.021 --> 02:59:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Break the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think different.</v>

4165
02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Think different and now it's like think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same and Natalie's they think the</v>

4166
02:59:14.641 --> 02:59:16.980
<v Speaker 2>same and if you don't think the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with you.</v>

4167
02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:18.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got a green text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell is wrong with you?</v>

4168
02:59:18.501 --> 02:59:19.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4169
02:59:19.261 --> 02:59:22.560
<v Speaker 2>apple for all the cries of everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>with trump in the taxes because</v>

4170
02:59:22.561 --> 02:59:24.150
<v Speaker 2>everything these days is somehow linked</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to together.</v>

4171
02:59:24.300 --> 02:59:26.580
<v Speaker 2>You know apple pays virtually no</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate taxes.</v>

4172
02:59:26.610 --> 02:59:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's his name?</v>

4173
02:59:28.141 --> 02:59:30.990
<v Speaker 2>The head guy now tim cook basically it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

4174
02:59:30.991 --> 02:59:32.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they rewrite fairer tax laws,</v>

4175
02:59:32.971 --> 02:59:35.420
<v Speaker 2>we'll bring our money back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now know some back.</v>

4176
02:59:35.450 --> 02:59:38.340
<v Speaker 2>For some reason nobody's upset by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't see people throwing iphone is</v>

4177
02:59:38.341 --> 02:59:40.410
<v Speaker 2>out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is they have a</v>

4178
02:59:40.411 --> 02:59:44.550
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as a gigantic corporation</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the people that hold their stock.</v>

4179
02:59:44.910 --> 02:59:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a weird thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>with corporations.</v>

4180
02:59:47.570 --> 02:59:49.950
<v Speaker 2>They're public and people own stock in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4181
02:59:49.951 --> 02:59:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a direct obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stockholders to make a profit.</v>

4182
02:59:52.621 --> 02:59:54.330
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't that prove trump's point</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

4183
02:59:54.390 --> 02:59:56.520
<v Speaker 2>So it does proves his point because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4184
02:59:56.521 --> 02:59:58.610
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing what's legal.</v>

4185
02:59:58.700 --> 03:00:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Right at the end of the year when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4186
03:00:00.840 --> 03:00:03.570
<v Speaker 2>when you go to pay your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure you tell your account in</v>

4187
03:00:03.571 --> 03:00:05.220
<v Speaker 2>the same thing that every sensible</v>
<v Speaker 2>person does,</v>

4188
03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:08.130
<v Speaker 2>which is do whatever is legal and I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay the least amount of taxes.</v>

4189
03:00:08.340 --> 03:00:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still don't see everybody.</v>

4190
03:00:09.580 --> 03:00:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Does tax shelters exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4191
03:00:12.390 --> 03:00:13.620
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

4192
03:00:13.621 --> 03:00:15.390
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't released his taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's shitty.</v>

4193
03:00:15.391 --> 03:00:16.320
<v Speaker 2>And he lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

4194
03:00:16.321 --> 03:00:18.300
<v Speaker 2>he's lying when he says the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>auditing,</v>

4195
03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:19.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's whole thing is,</v>

4196
03:00:19.171 --> 03:00:20.790
<v Speaker 2>well I'm under audit so I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

4197
03:00:20.940 --> 03:00:22.770
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the next sentence at the last</v>

4198
03:00:22.771 --> 03:00:23.491
<v Speaker 2>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

4199
03:00:23.491 --> 03:00:25.320
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write it but I won't do it.</v>

4200
03:00:25.321 --> 03:00:28.740
<v Speaker 2>But if hillary releases her emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll release my taxes.</v>

4201
03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:29.581
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

4202
03:00:29.581 --> 03:00:30.550
<v Speaker 2>which is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4203
03:00:30.610 --> 03:00:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the Goldman Sachs</v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches,</v>

4204
03:00:32.131 --> 03:00:33.000
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4205
03:00:33.001 --> 03:00:34.920
<v Speaker 2>he said emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said emails,</v>

4206
03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:36.150
<v Speaker 2>so he's lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4207
03:00:36.151 --> 03:00:37.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just a way of lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm under audit,</v>

4208
03:00:37.741 --> 03:00:39.840
<v Speaker 2>which there is no technical reason that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't.</v>

4209
03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:41.670
<v Speaker 2>But then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if she does hers,</v>

4210
03:00:41.860 --> 03:00:43.380
<v Speaker 2>you know that thing I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

4211
03:00:43.410 --> 03:00:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Well there's no technical reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's his argument.</v>

4212
03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:49.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like while they're auditing him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to do it cause he doesn't</v>

4213
03:00:49.321 --> 03:00:50.490
<v Speaker 2>have to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4214
03:00:50.491 --> 03:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>which does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they are auditing him like why</v>

4215
03:00:54.091 --> 03:00:56.490
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't want to like open it up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>public discourse.</v>

4216
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

4217
03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:00.100
<v Speaker 2>so that in itself may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea</v>

4218
03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:01.590
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if she realizes her emails off,</v>

4219
03:01:01.591 --> 03:01:03.790
<v Speaker 4>forget that whole thing with the audit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll go ahead and do it like that.</v>

4220
03:01:03.860 --> 03:01:07.830
<v Speaker 5>You think though that that would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he did releases taxes while they were</v>

4221
03:01:07.831 --> 03:01:11.040
<v Speaker 5>auditing him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could positively effect for sure.</v>

4222
03:01:11.041 --> 03:01:13.770
<v Speaker 5>Cause it would affect public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we know for a fact that public</v>

4223
03:01:13.771 --> 03:01:17.730
<v Speaker 5>opinion has had a big impact on things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that may,</v>

4224
03:01:17.731 --> 03:01:18.091
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

4225
03:01:18.091 --> 03:01:20.850
<v Speaker 5>if people didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't get outraged about it.</v>

4226
03:01:21.090 --> 03:01:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the president or whoever's in</v>
<v Speaker 5>charge wouldn't move in a certain</v>

4227
03:01:24.511 --> 03:01:25.260
<v Speaker 5>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4228
03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4229
03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the point is that if you want</v>

4230
03:01:27.811 --> 03:01:29.880
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you feel that this stuff is broken,</v>

4231
03:01:29.881 --> 03:01:33.600
<v Speaker 4>that the tax system is broken and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys that can hide money in,</v>

4232
03:01:33.660 --> 03:01:34.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4233
03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:35.700
<v Speaker 4>offshore accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think all that's broken,</v>

4234
03:01:36.030 --> 03:01:37.920
<v Speaker 4>don't be upset at the businessman who</v>
<v Speaker 4>used it.</v>

4235
03:01:37.921 --> 03:01:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Now that doesn't mean what he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>was ethical or whatever.</v>

4236
03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:43.050
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it wasn't.</v>

4237
03:01:43.051 --> 03:01:44.700
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a different conversation.</v>

4238
03:01:44.701 --> 03:01:48.010
<v Speaker 4>But you have to be upset at the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who put the laws in place that allow</v>

4239
03:01:48.011 --> 03:01:51.450
<v Speaker 4>this to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any businessman just uses the system as</v>

4240
03:01:51.451 --> 03:01:53.280
<v Speaker 4>it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when all these people are like,</v>

4241
03:01:53.281 --> 03:01:55.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump makes his ties in Mexico.</v>

4242
03:01:55.770 --> 03:01:58.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a smart businessman in that regard.</v>

4243
03:01:58.561 --> 03:02:03.030
<v Speaker 4>He uses cheap Mexican labor if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>upset and that that is the reality than</v>

4244
03:02:03.031 --> 03:02:05.400
<v Speaker 4>be upset at the people who set up those</v>
<v Speaker 4>trade deals.</v>

4245
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:08.440
<v Speaker 5>But isn't the issue really not the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does the stuff in Mexico,</v>

4246
03:02:08.441 --> 03:02:12.190
<v Speaker 5>the issue is that he does it in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it only pays people at tiny amount</v>

4247
03:02:12.191 --> 03:02:15.370
<v Speaker 5>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If somebody opened up a plant in Mexico</v>

4248
03:02:15.371 --> 03:02:18.610
<v Speaker 5>and paid people American wages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there would be no incentive whatsoever</v>

4249
03:02:18.611 --> 03:02:22.090
<v Speaker 5>to go to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should have laws as human beings and</v>

4250
03:02:22.091 --> 03:02:23.860
<v Speaker 5>what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we allow.</v>

4251
03:02:23.861 --> 03:02:25.960
<v Speaker 5>And not just in America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just say,</v>

4252
03:02:25.961 --> 03:02:28.360
<v Speaker 5>you go past this line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a rock over there.</v>

4253
03:02:28.361 --> 03:02:31.090
<v Speaker 5>Once you pass that rock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can pay him 7 cents an hour.</v>

4254
03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:33.880
<v Speaker 5>But over here we get 11 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fuck right,</v>

4255
03:02:34.170 --> 03:02:36.670
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So team Merica world police.</v>

4256
03:02:36.780 --> 03:02:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not defending the ethics of his</v>

4257
03:02:39.481 --> 03:02:41.580
<v Speaker 4>business practices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying all a bit.</v>

4258
03:02:41.581 --> 03:02:42.331
<v Speaker 4>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4259
03:02:42.331 --> 03:02:46.260
<v Speaker 4>they're beholding to their stock shares</v>
<v Speaker 4>and their holders and all that stuff.</v>

4260
03:02:46.500 --> 03:02:48.930
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just saying if he didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything illegal,</v>

4261
03:02:48.990 --> 03:02:51.600
<v Speaker 4>then he just did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just played the system.</v>

4262
03:02:51.601 --> 03:02:55.230
<v Speaker 4>So you should be angry at the system and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say he's immoral or took</v>

4263
03:02:55.231 --> 03:02:58.920
<v Speaker 4>advantage in a way that a more less</v>
<v Speaker 4>unscrupulous business person may not</v>

4264
03:02:58.921 --> 03:03:00.330
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's the type of person you</v>

4265
03:03:00.331 --> 03:03:01.920
<v Speaker 4>would want to work with and not a Donald</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump.</v>

4266
03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:04.690
<v Speaker 4>But that's why this is really complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we instead,</v>

4267
03:03:04.710 --> 03:03:07.470
<v Speaker 4>people look at the ties in Mexico and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go see he's a hypocrite and it's</v>

4268
03:03:07.471 --> 03:03:11.750
<v Speaker 4>like not quite the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he is.</v>

4269
03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:13.470
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a hypocrite for a minute.</v>

4270
03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.410
<v Speaker 5>He's a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was talking about of</v>

4271
03:03:16.411 --> 03:03:18.240
<v Speaker 5>corporations go over to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will,</v>

4272
03:03:18.241 --> 03:03:20.910
<v Speaker 5>we'll find them to the tune of 35% yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4273
03:03:20.911 --> 03:03:22.200
<v Speaker 5>but you were already there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4274
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:25.230
<v Speaker 5>but if you're running for president and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're making your ties over there,</v>

4275
03:03:25.231 --> 03:03:26.630
<v Speaker 5>you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4276
03:03:26.670 --> 03:03:29.280
<v Speaker 5>cause you're saying there's something</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong with the company taking their</v>

4277
03:03:29.281 --> 03:03:32.760
<v Speaker 5>stuff and moving over there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>profiting from it and taking jobs out of</v>

4278
03:03:32.761 --> 03:03:33.750
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do it.</v>

4279
03:03:33.751 --> 03:03:35.070
<v Speaker 5>I've already done it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm doing it right now.</v>

4280
03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:36.540
<v Speaker 5>So if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to find you.</v>

4281
03:03:36.610 --> 03:03:38.860
<v Speaker 4>So that's a at least,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're making a distinction there</v>

4282
03:03:38.861 --> 03:03:41.410
<v Speaker 4>that in the course of this he could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

4283
03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to do it any more to show</v>
<v Speaker 4>you that I'm going to be moral or</v>

4284
03:03:46.391 --> 03:03:48.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ethical or whatever.</v>

4285
03:03:48.161 --> 03:03:48.994
<v Speaker 4>I will stop.</v>

4286
03:03:49.090 --> 03:03:51.880
<v Speaker 5>It isn't the ethical moral way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to just pay them more.</v>

4287
03:03:52.540 --> 03:03:53.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

4288
03:03:53.051 --> 03:03:56.080
<v Speaker 5>But that's unfortunately we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>reality that,</v>

4289
03:03:56.110 --> 03:03:58.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what a loss so much it past that</v>

4290
03:03:58.551 --> 03:04:00.320
<v Speaker 5>as human beings that live in the United</v>
<v Speaker 5>States,</v>

4291
03:04:00.321 --> 03:04:02.480
<v Speaker 5>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the United States of America,</v>

4292
03:04:02.481 --> 03:04:05.570
<v Speaker 5>one of the most fortunate countries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not the most fortunate in the world.</v>

4293
03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:09.770
<v Speaker 5>We will respect our American privilege</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4294
03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:14.920
<v Speaker 5>not be willing to subjugate people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>live in impoverished countries too.</v>

4295
03:04:15.380 --> 03:04:16.990
<v Speaker 5>Like taking advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do,</v>

4296
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:20.150
<v Speaker 5>don't take advantage of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An unfortunate circumstances like if</v>

4297
03:04:20.151 --> 03:04:24.770
<v Speaker 5>you're living in a very poor third world</v>
<v Speaker 5>country and a Nike factory opens up or</v>

4298
03:04:24.771 --> 03:04:26.630
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>

4299
03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:31.010
<v Speaker 5>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a person who is aware that they have</v>

4300
03:04:31.011 --> 03:04:34.760
<v Speaker 5>the best like location roll the dice</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's available today.</v>

4301
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:37.610
<v Speaker 5>You're living in America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're born here like the fact that</v>

4302
03:04:37.611 --> 03:04:41.300
<v Speaker 5>you're going to like make someone in</v>
<v Speaker 5>some other country work for essentially</v>

4303
03:04:41.301 --> 03:04:44.660
<v Speaker 5>with slave labor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the phone you buy this fucking</v>

4304
03:04:44.661 --> 03:04:48.380
<v Speaker 5>iphone having my hand is made in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>factory where they have nets around the</v>

4305
03:04:48.381 --> 03:04:52.910
<v Speaker 5>factory because so many people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to kill themselves that they made</v>

4306
03:04:52.911 --> 03:04:56.330
<v Speaker 5>it where they catch you in a fucking net</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you jump off the roof because they</v>

4307
03:04:56.331 --> 03:04:58.310
<v Speaker 5>were cleaning up bodies off the ground.</v>

4308
03:04:58.940 --> 03:05:02.570
<v Speaker 5>And when people defend it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they defend it in the most bizarre way</v>

4309
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:04.090
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the defense is.</v>

4310
03:05:04.310 --> 03:05:06.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the percentage of people that commit</v>

4311
03:05:06.111 --> 03:05:09.650
<v Speaker 5>suicide of those factories is very</v>
<v Speaker 5>similar to the percentage of people that</v>

4312
03:05:09.880 --> 03:05:14.870
<v Speaker 5>commit suicide and the culture factory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No fucking money.</v>

4313
03:05:14.871 --> 03:05:16.730
<v Speaker 5>And they live at the factory and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>jumping off the roof.</v>

4314
03:05:16.731 --> 03:05:17.720
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't defend that.</v>

4315
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:19.940
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then what do you make of our sort of</v>

4316
03:05:19.941 --> 03:05:24.020
<v Speaker 5>fake moralizing with this where you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are fully acknowledging we both have</v>

4317
03:05:24.021 --> 03:05:25.760
<v Speaker 5>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we both paid a lot of money for it.</v>

4318
03:05:25.761 --> 03:05:28.580
<v Speaker 5>We acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have the intellectual knowledge of</v>

4319
03:05:28.581 --> 03:05:31.760
<v Speaker 5>what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they do some shady things and yet</v>

4320
03:05:31.761 --> 03:05:35.150
<v Speaker 5>at the same time all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing the exact same thing with us</v>

4321
03:05:35.151 --> 03:05:38.180
<v Speaker 5>that have this phone will go buzzard</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the ties.</v>

4322
03:05:38.210 --> 03:05:41.090
<v Speaker 5>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we picked we and that goes to this</v>

4323
03:05:41.091 --> 03:05:45.170
<v Speaker 5>side's everyone's picking aside so well</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can just go and ask you this guy.</v>

4324
03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:46.820
<v Speaker 5>They're going after this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's,</v>

4325
03:05:47.090 --> 03:05:49.310
<v Speaker 5>there's validity to what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though they have a phone that was</v>

4326
03:05:49.311 --> 03:05:51.710
<v Speaker 5>built by slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's still validity in what they're</v>

4327
03:05:51.711 --> 03:05:52.730
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And not only that,</v>

4328
03:05:52.940 --> 03:05:56.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean we had Shane Smith from vice on</v>
<v Speaker 5>one day and we were talking about the</v>

4329
03:05:56.391 --> 03:05:58.750
<v Speaker 5>cult [inaudible] cult Tran,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Colton,</v>

4330
03:05:58.780 --> 03:06:01.760
<v Speaker 5>that they had to take out of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the con in the Congo and how,</v>

4331
03:06:01.790 --> 03:06:02.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>

4332
03:06:02.631 --> 03:06:04.670
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way they were getting a lot of the</v>

4333
03:06:04.850 --> 03:06:08.840
<v Speaker 5>elements that they use in cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking complete slave labor and</v>

4334
03:06:08.841 --> 03:06:10.240
<v Speaker 5>child labor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4335
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:13.220
<v Speaker 5>it's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>scary stuff when you get down to the</v>

4336
03:06:13.221 --> 03:06:16.460
<v Speaker 5>nitty gritty of how things are</v>
<v Speaker 5>manufactured and constructed in order</v>

4337
03:06:16.461 --> 03:06:18.170
<v Speaker 5>for us to get them at a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 5>price,</v>

4338
03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:19.670
<v Speaker 5>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4339
03:06:19.710 --> 03:06:22.550
<v Speaker 5>it's just really spooky that we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to do that.</v>

4340
03:06:23.120 --> 03:06:24.840
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4341
03:06:24.860 --> 03:06:25.710
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a,</v>

4342
03:06:25.711 --> 03:06:26.980
<v Speaker 5>we just sinked up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was why,</v>

4343
03:06:27.010 --> 03:06:28.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's partly,</v>

4344
03:06:28.371 --> 03:06:31.210
<v Speaker 5>it's just the unintended consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanting things,</v>

4345
03:06:31.211 --> 03:06:33.350
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also the unintended consequences of</v>

4346
03:06:33.351 --> 03:06:36.170
<v Speaker 5>having this business model of unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 5>growth.</v>

4347
03:06:37.220 --> 03:06:41.720
<v Speaker 5>And that what we're talking about about</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump having a sort of responsibility to</v>

4348
03:06:41.721 --> 03:06:44.690
<v Speaker 5>its shareholders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like apple having a responsibility</v>

4349
03:06:44.691 --> 03:06:48.740
<v Speaker 5>to their shareholders like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing of unlimited growth places</v>

4350
03:06:48.741 --> 03:06:52.790
<v Speaker 5>more allity at the end of the list of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of motivations for what you're doing.</v>

4351
03:06:52.970 --> 03:06:55.770
<v Speaker 5>And there's a thing called diffusion of</v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility that takes place when you</v>

4352
03:06:55.771 --> 03:06:56.430
<v Speaker 5>have a gigantic</v>

4353
03:06:56.430 --> 03:06:59.220
<v Speaker 3>group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call themselves a corporation.</v>

4354
03:06:59.221 --> 03:07:01.050
<v Speaker 3>You're just a little piece of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation.</v>

4355
03:07:01.290 --> 03:07:04.830
<v Speaker 3>It's not like Dave Rubin's out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>making people work for 13 cents an hour.</v>

4356
03:07:05.070 --> 03:07:06.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Microsoft or it's,</v>

4357
03:07:06.991 --> 03:07:08.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitachi or you know,</v>

4358
03:07:08.941 --> 03:07:10.620
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if those companies do bad</v>

4359
03:07:10.621 --> 03:07:12.240
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever company it is,</v>

4360
03:07:12.241 --> 03:07:15.420
<v Speaker 3>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's paying people ridiculously low</v>

4361
03:07:15.421 --> 03:07:16.660
<v Speaker 3>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4362
03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:18.840
<v Speaker 3>that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4363
03:07:19.010 --> 03:07:23.550
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corporation becomes this entity that</v>

4364
03:07:23.551 --> 03:07:26.760
<v Speaker 3>needs Zeros and ones and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to get them and you</v>

4365
03:07:26.761 --> 03:07:28.710
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get them by taking these people that</v>

4366
03:07:28.711 --> 03:07:31.140
<v Speaker 3>have worked for us for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking casting them out.</v>

4367
03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4368
03:07:32.490 --> 03:07:33.330
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're good.</v>

4369
03:07:33.331 --> 03:07:34.840
<v Speaker 3>They do a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them.</v>

4370
03:07:35.130 --> 03:07:37.350
<v Speaker 3>You cut them off and you make asphalt</v>
<v Speaker 3>face to the right,</v>

4371
03:07:37.530 --> 03:07:39.300
<v Speaker 3>work for extra hours a day.</v>

4372
03:07:39.610 --> 03:07:42.900
<v Speaker 3>So then you take instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of all the executives and all the</v>

4373
03:07:42.930 --> 03:07:46.650
<v Speaker 3>mid level people that they've got up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cupertino making absurds amount of</v>

4374
03:07:46.651 --> 03:07:47.640
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just talking about the</v>

4375
03:07:47.641 --> 03:07:50.760
<v Speaker 3>shareholders who cashed in on talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about all those silicon valley guys</v>

4376
03:07:50.761 --> 03:07:53.370
<v Speaker 3>making an absurd amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't begrudge any of them any of that</v>

4377
03:07:53.371 --> 03:07:55.290
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But imagine if all of them who could</v>

4378
03:07:55.291 --> 03:08:00.180
<v Speaker 3>live incredibly well on 10% of what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have and funneled some of that money,</v>

4379
03:08:00.181 --> 03:08:03.210
<v Speaker 3>did the same people making their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a socialist.</v>

4380
03:08:03.211 --> 03:08:05.430
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm not even saying this</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be the right thing to do in any</v>

4381
03:08:05.431 --> 03:08:06.720
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like they,</v>

4382
03:08:06.721 --> 03:08:09.060
<v Speaker 3>those people all walk around with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty clean conscience.</v>

4383
03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:10.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they have,</v>

4384
03:08:10.531 --> 03:08:11.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fancy,</v>

4385
03:08:11.611 --> 03:08:15.210
<v Speaker 3>you know they probably all have teslas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that shit and the people that</v>

4386
03:08:15.211 --> 03:08:18.510
<v Speaker 3>are literally making the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the ones coming up with the,</v>

4387
03:08:18.810 --> 03:08:21.790
<v Speaker 3>the ideas in Cupertino cause they always</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you know,</v>

4388
03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Boto in Cupertino but meanwhile they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't say made in China within that.</v>

4389
03:08:25.710 --> 03:08:28.650
<v Speaker 3>It is interesting how we really</v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguished very clearly the</v>

4390
03:08:28.651 --> 03:08:32.160
<v Speaker 3>difference between the person who has</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea and the person who puts the</v>

4391
03:08:32.161 --> 03:08:36.000
<v Speaker 3>idea together with their fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not nearly as valuable but</v>

4392
03:08:36.001 --> 03:08:38.850
<v Speaker 3>without that person putting it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because whatever gets done,</v>

4393
03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:43.500
<v Speaker 3>like the manufacturing process does not</v>
<v Speaker 3>just include the people that buy the</v>

4394
03:08:43.501 --> 03:08:45.930
<v Speaker 3>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That includes the people that work for</v>

4395
03:08:45.931 --> 03:08:48.330
<v Speaker 3>the people that buy the machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the people that buy the machines get</v>

4396
03:08:48.331 --> 03:08:50.250
<v Speaker 3>so much more money than the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>work for them.</v>

4397
03:08:50.251 --> 03:08:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And then the people that designed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>plans and give them to the people that</v>

4398
03:08:53.731 --> 03:08:55.350
<v Speaker 3>buy the machines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get even more money.</v>

4399
03:08:55.740 --> 03:08:58.770
<v Speaker 3>They get the most money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who design the idea is most</v>

4400
03:08:58.771 --> 03:09:02.940
<v Speaker 3>important and I don't know if that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of like the nature of the thing</v>

4401
03:09:03.330 --> 03:09:07.110
<v Speaker 3>that like that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's set up that way because that's,</v>

4402
03:09:07.111 --> 03:09:07.860
<v Speaker 3>those are the people.</v>

4403
03:09:07.860 --> 03:09:11.430
<v Speaker 3>The people at the very top are the ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are going to expand this weird thing</v>

4404
03:09:11.431 --> 03:09:14.400
<v Speaker 3>that we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Expand this technological sort of</v>

4405
03:09:14.401 --> 03:09:19.401
<v Speaker 3>progression that just this ongoing wave</v>
<v Speaker 3>of improvement and innovation that we</v>

4406
03:09:19.981 --> 03:09:22.800
<v Speaker 3>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We demand new better versions.</v>

4407
03:09:22.801 --> 03:09:24.990
<v Speaker 3>We not an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven's a piece of shit.</v>

4408
03:09:24.991 --> 03:09:28.290
<v Speaker 3>When's the eight come out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do the aid's going to have hd reality</v>

4409
03:09:28.291 --> 03:09:31.680
<v Speaker 3>built in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question really at the end of the</v>

4410
03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:35.760
<v Speaker 3>day is are any of us happier or any of</v>
<v Speaker 3>us more functional or any of us more?</v>

4411
03:09:36.450 --> 03:09:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what have we done here?</v>

4412
03:09:38.790 --> 03:09:42.930
<v Speaker 3>What have we done is any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were to gauge happiness of the</v>

4413
03:09:42.931 --> 03:09:47.460
<v Speaker 3>average person who had the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical attributes as you that grew up</v>

4414
03:09:47.461 --> 03:09:50.940
<v Speaker 3>in the same town you grew up in in 1950</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus right now,</v>

4415
03:09:50.970 --> 03:09:53.950
<v Speaker 3>is there any quantifiable difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would</v>

4416
03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:56.680
<v Speaker 5>argue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would guess that basically it's no,</v>

4417
03:09:56.830 --> 03:09:59.710
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean this thing has done</v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible things cause Tahrir Square,</v>

4418
03:09:59.711 --> 03:10:02.230
<v Speaker 5>all the revolutions that haven't really</v>
<v Speaker 5>worked out the way they're supposed to,</v>

4419
03:10:02.231 --> 03:10:05.860
<v Speaker 5>but it connected people all over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world and that's pretty awesome.</v>

4420
03:10:05.861 --> 03:10:07.360
<v Speaker 5>So it does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course it does great stuff.</v>

4421
03:10:07.660 --> 03:10:10.930
<v Speaker 5>But like in terms of what are we</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually chasing constantly,</v>

4422
03:10:10.931 --> 03:10:12.760
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is no end because once it's always</v>

4423
03:10:12.761 --> 03:10:14.410
<v Speaker 5>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well we got an mu,</v>

4424
03:10:14.411 --> 03:10:14.711
<v Speaker 5>nu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nu,</v>

4425
03:10:14.711 --> 03:10:15.071
<v Speaker 5>nu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>NU,</v>

4426
03:10:15.071 --> 03:10:16.660
<v Speaker 5>nu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause you're not chasing happiness,</v>

4427
03:10:16.661 --> 03:10:18.550
<v Speaker 5>you're not chasing fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not chasing,</v>

4428
03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:20.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the,</v>

4429
03:10:20.051 --> 03:10:23.320
<v Speaker 5>the end game of the human experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just chasing something.</v>

4430
03:10:23.380 --> 03:10:26.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's for humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's for the next thing.</v>

4431
03:10:26.650 --> 03:10:29.440
<v Speaker 5>I think we're setting it up for the next</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing or the little workers that are</v>

4432
03:10:29.441 --> 03:10:31.510
<v Speaker 5>building the shop for the machine</v>
<v Speaker 5>overlords.</v>

4433
03:10:31.511 --> 03:10:33.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're the guys with the nats or we're</v>

4434
03:10:33.671 --> 03:10:34.390
<v Speaker 5>the guys with the nets.</v>

4435
03:10:34.390 --> 03:10:38.710
<v Speaker 5>We just don't think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're our thirst for technology is</v>

4436
03:10:38.711 --> 03:10:43.360
<v Speaker 5>probably connected in some way to this</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing wanting to emerge and that as we</v>

4437
03:10:43.361 --> 03:10:46.720
<v Speaker 5>become more and more materialistic and</v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in the latest and greatest,</v>

4438
03:10:46.721 --> 03:10:51.310
<v Speaker 5>we feel we fuel this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this innovation and we're a part of it</v>

4439
03:10:51.311 --> 03:10:54.670
<v Speaker 5>whether we like it or know it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why like as a human being,</v>

4440
03:10:54.671 --> 03:10:57.820
<v Speaker 5>it's very frustrating and confusing when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're addicted to technology,</v>

4441
03:10:58.120 --> 03:10:59.860
<v Speaker 5>when you're caught up in it and locked</v>
<v Speaker 5>away in it.</v>

4442
03:11:00.130 --> 03:11:03.970
<v Speaker 5>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find that the only way I stay happy as</v>

4443
03:11:03.971 --> 03:11:07.180
<v Speaker 5>by being involved in very physical</v>
<v Speaker 5>things like,</v>

4444
03:11:07.181 --> 03:11:09.970
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 5>why record numbers of people are</v>

4445
03:11:09.971 --> 03:11:12.520
<v Speaker 5>depressed today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're not fulfilling the human</v>

4446
03:11:12.521 --> 03:11:14.950
<v Speaker 5>requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their biological human requirements.</v>

4447
03:11:15.250 --> 03:11:18.010
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise is gigantic.</v>

4448
03:11:18.011 --> 03:11:21.370
<v Speaker 5>Meditation is also gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I also consider a very physical</v>

4449
03:11:21.371 --> 03:11:23.080
<v Speaker 5>thing because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a focus.</v>

4450
03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:27.820
<v Speaker 5>Concentration internally versus on</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever bullshit is on my fucking</v>

4451
03:11:27.821 --> 03:11:32.050
<v Speaker 5>twitter feed or whatever facebook feed</v>
<v Speaker 5>or dealing with some nonsense about a</v>

4452
03:11:32.051 --> 03:11:34.030
<v Speaker 5>job you don't really give a fuck about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of that,</v>

4453
03:11:34.031 --> 03:11:36.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm focusing on things that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>important to me,</v>

4454
03:11:36.431 --> 03:11:38.530
<v Speaker 5>like the management of the actual mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

4455
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:43.780
<v Speaker 5>I think putting yourself in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>competition scenario is putting in</v>

4456
03:11:43.781 --> 03:11:45.550
<v Speaker 5>things where you have to perform under</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure.</v>

4457
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:48.940
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why people get</v>
<v Speaker 5>so addicted to Jujitsu because then it's</v>

4458
03:11:48.941 --> 03:11:51.790
<v Speaker 5>like this high level problem solving</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that you're doing all the time and</v>

4459
03:11:51.791 --> 03:11:56.200
<v Speaker 5>it makes regular life seems so much more</v>
<v Speaker 5>easy to manage and regular dilemmas are</v>

4460
03:11:56.201 --> 03:12:00.160
<v Speaker 5>nothing compared to a fucking hundred 90</v>
<v Speaker 5>pound man who's built like a gorilla on</v>

4461
03:12:00.161 --> 03:12:03.500
<v Speaker 5>your back trying to choke you sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That reminds me of the gym in West</v>

4462
03:12:03.500 --> 03:12:06.610
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood and actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I did there,</v>

4463
03:12:06.990 --> 03:12:09.850
<v Speaker 5>probing ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think regardless,</v>

4464
03:12:09.851 --> 03:12:10.600
<v Speaker 5>it's happening.</v>

4465
03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.060
<v Speaker 5>It's happening to US regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The technology in my mind,</v>

4466
03:12:13.061 --> 03:12:16.060
<v Speaker 5>nonsense and talking to you about</v>
<v Speaker 5>switching a windows 10 and a fucking</v>

4467
03:12:16.270 --> 03:12:18.220
<v Speaker 5>google phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this bullshit stupid.</v>

4468
03:12:18.430 --> 03:12:20.320
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to fix anything and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>not trying to,</v>

4469
03:12:20.321 --> 03:12:23.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not claiming to not claiming that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever possibly could or have the</v>

4470
03:12:23.531 --> 03:12:26.380
<v Speaker 5>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I'm saying is you as a human</v>

4471
03:12:26.381 --> 03:12:31.381
<v Speaker 5>being have an obligation to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To extract that happy juice out of your</v>

4472
03:12:32.411 --> 03:12:36.640
<v Speaker 5>body in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think we're designed to sit</v>

4473
03:12:36.641 --> 03:12:38.350
<v Speaker 5>at desks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we're designed for</v>

4474
03:12:38.351 --> 03:12:40.930
<v Speaker 5>fluorescent lights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we're designed for movies</v>

4475
03:12:41.260 --> 03:12:43.360
<v Speaker 5>and all those things are great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those things are great,</v>

4476
03:12:43.361 --> 03:12:46.060
<v Speaker 5>but you got to manage the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>exposure you have.</v>

4477
03:12:46.061 --> 03:12:48.040
<v Speaker 5>Did that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to manage the amount of</v>

4478
03:12:48.041 --> 03:12:50.410
<v Speaker 5>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to fictitional narratives.</v>

4479
03:12:50.620 --> 03:12:53.750
<v Speaker 5>You have to merit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to manage the kind of exposure</v>

4480
03:12:53.770 --> 03:12:55.580
<v Speaker 5>you have to electronic influence.</v>

4481
03:12:55.940 --> 03:12:57.530
<v Speaker 5>You have to manage the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just like,</v>

4482
03:12:57.531 --> 03:12:59.330
<v Speaker 5>you have to manage the type of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are in your life.</v>

4483
03:12:59.331 --> 03:13:01.400
<v Speaker 5>You around people that are complaining</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

4484
03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:03.530
<v Speaker 5>If you just around people that just wine</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>

4485
03:13:03.531 --> 03:13:04.910
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another day,</v>

4486
03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:07.520
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4487
03:13:07.521 --> 03:13:09.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you didn't see the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

4488
03:13:09.740 --> 03:13:11.840
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid's movie about,</v>

4489
03:13:11.841 --> 03:13:15.570
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside out and it's about like this</v>

4490
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:17.360
<v Speaker 5>girl's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little kids moving.</v>

4491
03:13:17.361 --> 03:13:20.000
<v Speaker 5>So all of my daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a little kid's movie about</v>

4492
03:13:20.001 --> 03:13:22.700
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this girl has like these characters in</v>

4493
03:13:22.701 --> 03:13:25.370
<v Speaker 5>her brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them's anger and Lewis Black</v>

4494
03:13:25.371 --> 03:13:26.990
<v Speaker 5>place anger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fucking awesome.</v>

4495
03:13:27.410 --> 03:13:29.810
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the other one is sadness and sad.</v>

4496
03:13:29.811 --> 03:13:34.811
<v Speaker 5>I was like molly and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sadness touches becomes sadness.</v>

4497
03:13:35.061 --> 03:13:37.790
<v Speaker 5>Like everything turns blue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of an interesting movie</v>

4498
03:13:37.791 --> 03:13:39.110
<v Speaker 5>because it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's entertaining,</v>

4499
03:13:39.111 --> 03:13:40.490
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of,</v>

4500
03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:43.040
<v Speaker 5>there's a lesson to be learned for</v>
<v Speaker 5>children that like you can,</v>

4501
03:13:43.041 --> 03:13:45.530
<v Speaker 5>you can marinate in those fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>

4502
03:13:45.650 --> 03:13:48.260
<v Speaker 5>You can allow those thoughts to</v>
<v Speaker 5>influence and touch all these different</v>

4503
03:13:48.261 --> 03:13:50.690
<v Speaker 5>aspects of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or you can figure out how to stop them,</v>

4504
03:13:50.900 --> 03:13:52.220
<v Speaker 5>like understand what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are,</v>

4505
03:13:52.221 --> 03:13:56.000
<v Speaker 5>these are these thoughts or it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a living thing,</v>

4506
03:13:56.001 --> 03:13:59.840
<v Speaker 5>like a life force and that living think</v>
<v Speaker 5>and grow if you feed it.</v>

4507
03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:03.320
<v Speaker 5>But if you don't feed it and you push</v>
<v Speaker 5>this side and you feed the positive</v>

4508
03:14:03.321 --> 03:14:05.930
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can manage that little fucker might</v>

4509
03:14:05.931 --> 03:14:08.450
<v Speaker 5>not ever go away because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>living in a movie.</v>

4510
03:14:08.810 --> 03:14:12.080
<v Speaker 5>But you could definitely manage it way</v>
<v Speaker 5>better than you're doing if you don't</v>

4511
03:14:12.081 --> 03:14:14.810
<v Speaker 5>take conscious decisions and what kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of energy you let into your life.</v>

4512
03:14:14.910 --> 03:14:15.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4513
03:14:15.421 --> 03:14:18.720
<v Speaker 4>we all know people that are addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own pain or their own trauma,</v>

4514
03:14:18.721 --> 03:14:21.540
<v Speaker 4>their own story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no matter what you do,</v>

4515
03:14:21.930 --> 03:14:23.670
<v Speaker 4>you know you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they love it.</v>

4516
03:14:23.730 --> 03:14:25.420
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all have relatives like this or,</v>

4517
03:14:25.430 --> 03:14:28.740
<v Speaker 4>or friends and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta do the work.</v>

4518
03:14:28.741 --> 03:14:31.080
<v Speaker 4>It is work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life is work.</v>

4519
03:14:31.110 --> 03:14:32.550
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is endless.</v>

4520
03:14:32.820 --> 03:14:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It's endless till it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you may regret not doing some</v>

4521
03:14:36.151 --> 03:14:36.660
<v Speaker 4>of the work.</v>

4522
03:14:36.660 --> 03:14:39.360
<v Speaker 5>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's your [inaudible].</v>

4523
03:14:39.380 --> 03:14:40.950
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no,</v>

4524
03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:44.370
<v Speaker 5>it's not like there's no options.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are options to fit thought</v>

4525
03:14:44.371 --> 03:14:47.520
<v Speaker 5>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you just allow these like deeply</v>

4526
03:14:47.521 --> 03:14:51.030
<v Speaker 5>ingrained paths to exist in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you immediately fall into</v>

4527
03:14:51.031 --> 03:14:53.340
<v Speaker 5>complaining and the woe is me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It never works out for me.</v>

4528
03:14:54.030 --> 03:14:57.780
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone sent me a text the other day</v>

4529
03:14:57.781 --> 03:15:00.150
<v Speaker 5>comparing to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was two,</v>

4530
03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:03.270
<v Speaker 5>the same thing happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are at the same event and one</v>

4531
03:15:03.271 --> 03:15:06.840
<v Speaker 5>person had this horrific like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all my God,</v>

4532
03:15:06.841 --> 03:15:08.490
<v Speaker 5>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the worst,</v>

4533
03:15:08.491 --> 03:15:10.610
<v Speaker 5>is such a waste of my time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other person was,</v>

4534
03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:11.640
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4535
03:15:11.641 --> 03:15:14.100
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't been good yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's still time,</v>

4536
03:15:14.250 --> 03:15:15.780
<v Speaker 5>exclamation point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smiley face.</v>

4537
03:15:15.781 --> 03:15:17.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a perfect example.</v>

4538
03:15:17.401 --> 03:15:20.550
<v Speaker 5>The difference between two different</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the exact same experience</v>

4539
03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:23.700
<v Speaker 5>having two different patterns that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>allow their brain to go down.</v>

4540
03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:27.360
<v Speaker 5>Now what if you find that that guy's on</v>
<v Speaker 5>his zoloft that has an issue?</v>

4541
03:15:27.390 --> 03:15:28.710
<v Speaker 5>That's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4542
03:15:28.711 --> 03:15:31.220
<v Speaker 5>And that's what a lot of people do</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of one.</v>

4543
03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:33.810
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not to disparage people who have</v>

4544
03:15:33.811 --> 03:15:36.790
<v Speaker 5>legitimate mental imbalances where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>need medication.</v>

4545
03:15:36.810 --> 03:15:39.000
<v Speaker 5>I have a bunch of friends that have had</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

4546
03:15:39.270 --> 03:15:42.050
<v Speaker 5>But the question with that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that nature or nurture?</v>

4547
03:15:42.060 --> 03:15:44.880
<v Speaker 5>Like what does it become,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it was causing these negative</v>

4548
03:15:44.881 --> 03:15:48.420
<v Speaker 5>thoughts in your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a biological issue that you have</v>

4549
03:15:48.421 --> 03:15:50.280
<v Speaker 5>because part of you is not working</v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly,</v>

4550
03:15:50.281 --> 03:15:53.670
<v Speaker 5>which is entirely possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or is it you've embraced these negative</v>

4551
03:15:53.671 --> 03:15:56.910
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and this negative program by</v>
<v Speaker 5>your family or by people that you hang</v>

4552
03:15:56.911 --> 03:16:00.600
<v Speaker 5>around with are bad influences and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've embraced it to the point where</v>

4553
03:16:00.601 --> 03:16:03.630
<v Speaker 5>you're unable to take these positive</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought patterns.</v>

4554
03:16:03.631 --> 03:16:05.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you almost like have to go to a retreat.</v>

4555
03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:08.370
<v Speaker 5>They almost have to like kidnap you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>put you on some island somewhere where</v>

4556
03:16:08.371 --> 03:16:10.380
<v Speaker 5>somebody talks to you and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

4557
03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:12.360
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is life right now is life.</v>

4558
03:16:12.510 --> 03:16:13.920
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to get back to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>email.</v>

4559
03:16:13.950 --> 03:16:15.490
<v Speaker 5>You think I know you think you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4560
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:18.090
<v Speaker 5>You know you don't have to get back to</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people that are negative,</v>

4561
03:16:18.091 --> 03:16:19.440
<v Speaker 5>that are in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to like,</v>

4562
03:16:19.470 --> 03:16:21.120
<v Speaker 5>this is life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This right here,</v>

4563
03:16:21.300 --> 03:16:22.950
<v Speaker 5>breathe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breathe out.</v>

4564
03:16:23.100 --> 03:16:26.070
<v Speaker 5>You're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're also alive and maybe the greatest</v>

4565
03:16:26.071 --> 03:16:28.350
<v Speaker 5>fucking time the world has ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean come on man.</v>

4566
03:16:28.380 --> 03:16:30.360
<v Speaker 5>There's never been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's never been easier to get food.</v>

4567
03:16:30.450 --> 03:16:31.920
<v Speaker 5>It's never been safer to walk the</v>
<v Speaker 5>streets.</v>

4568
03:16:32.100 --> 03:16:34.170
<v Speaker 5>There's never been more cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool people to communicate with.</v>

4569
03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:37.410
<v Speaker 5>This is the best fucking time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like don't go woe is me.</v>

4570
03:16:37.411 --> 03:16:38.780
<v Speaker 5>Cause some girls want to suck your Dick</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anymore.</v>

4571
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:41.910
<v Speaker 5>Just do we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you just fucking stop and relax for</v>

4572
03:16:41.911 --> 03:16:44.970
<v Speaker 5>a moment?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were a 90 year old man living in</v>

4573
03:16:44.971 --> 03:16:47.250
<v Speaker 5>Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that his whole life he had been</v>

4574
03:16:47.251 --> 03:16:50.940
<v Speaker 5>forced to be a farmer working for</v>
<v Speaker 5>pennies and eating fucking raw potatoes</v>

4575
03:16:50.941 --> 03:16:53.190
<v Speaker 5>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and someone gave you the opportunity to</v>

4576
03:16:53.191 --> 03:16:56.310
<v Speaker 5>come here and beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now how God damn happy would you be?</v>

4577
03:16:56.880 --> 03:16:58.140
<v Speaker 5>You'd be so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4578
03:16:58.141 --> 03:16:59.520
<v Speaker 5>that is you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's you right now.</v>

4579
03:16:59.521 --> 03:17:04.521
<v Speaker 5>You won the lottery bitch and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>still complaining and 99.9% of the</v>

4580
03:17:05.101 --> 03:17:09.870
<v Speaker 5>people listening have won the lottery in</v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison to all the other people that</v>

4581
03:17:09.871 --> 03:17:12.740
<v Speaker 5>they're going to come in contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in a lot of the other people,</v>

4582
03:17:13.210 --> 03:17:15.210
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're almost making a case though,</v>

4583
03:17:15.211 --> 03:17:19.020
<v Speaker 5>for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the key to happiness in the midst</v>

4584
03:17:19.021 --> 03:17:22.800
<v Speaker 5>of this technological monstrosity that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were part of that.</v>

4585
03:17:22.801 --> 03:17:26.940
<v Speaker 5>The key really is to disconnect yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>from it and there that comes with</v>

4586
03:17:26.941 --> 03:17:28.050
<v Speaker 5>certain costs too.</v>

4587
03:17:28.140 --> 03:17:30.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the disconnect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think to have discipline.</v>

4588
03:17:31.260 --> 03:17:34.200
<v Speaker 5>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least,</v>

4589
03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:36.960
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my best happiness comes from when I have</v>

4590
03:17:36.961 --> 03:17:40.260
<v Speaker 5>discipline and avoiding the technology</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

4591
03:17:40.290 --> 03:17:45.240
<v Speaker 5>or limiting my access to the technology</v>
<v Speaker 5>and consciously choosing to do other</v>

4592
03:17:45.241 --> 03:17:47.490
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4593
03:17:47.820 --> 03:17:50.160
<v Speaker 5>get involved in other hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get involved in,</v>

4594
03:17:50.190 --> 03:17:50.611
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4595
03:17:50.611 --> 03:17:53.130
<v Speaker 5>like whether it's yoga or archery or you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

4596
03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:55.170
<v Speaker 5>go run marathons or go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4597
03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:56.520
<v Speaker 5>get involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4598
03:17:56.521 --> 03:17:59.130
<v Speaker 5>to go in or a Jujitsu tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

4599
03:17:59.131 --> 03:18:00.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>climb a mountain.</v>

4600
03:18:00.510 --> 03:18:05.430
<v Speaker 5>There's things that people do that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard to do and you don't just do it to</v>

4601
03:18:05.431 --> 03:18:08.280
<v Speaker 5>get to the top of the mountain I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or to,</v>

4602
03:18:08.310 --> 03:18:09.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>finish the cross.</v>

4603
03:18:09.451 --> 03:18:11.820
<v Speaker 5>That line that you decided you're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to run to.</v>

4604
03:18:12.450 --> 03:18:14.280
<v Speaker 5>You do it because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

4605
03:18:14.281 --> 03:18:18.960
<v Speaker 5>your body requires it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your brain may require it like you as a</v>

4606
03:18:18.961 --> 03:18:23.961
<v Speaker 5>being as an entity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem solving and puzzle solving is a</v>

4607
03:18:24.001 --> 03:18:27.420
<v Speaker 5>part of who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Overcoming adversity is a muscle that's</v>

4608
03:18:27.421 --> 03:18:28.480
<v Speaker 5>gotta be exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4609
03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:31.560
<v Speaker 5>Cause if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then once the shit hits the fan,</v>

4610
03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:34.230
<v Speaker 5>you fucking fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we all know people like that.</v>

4611
03:18:34.590 --> 03:18:37.500
<v Speaker 5>They're just went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one bad thing goes on in their life.</v>

4612
03:18:37.710 --> 03:18:40.930
<v Speaker 5>They become blabbering fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4613
03:18:41.310 --> 03:18:44.070
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's why you gotta just push</v>

4614
03:18:44.090 --> 03:18:45.750
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you like you have no choice in a way.</v>

4615
03:18:45.751 --> 03:18:48.310
<v Speaker 5>I guess once you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which seems fairly</v>

4616
03:18:48.310 --> 03:18:50.770
<v Speaker 3>obvious to someone if you're awake</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

4617
03:18:50.920 --> 03:18:53.560
<v Speaker 3>once you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta just push and push and push</v>

4618
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:55.780
<v Speaker 3>and you will fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I've said several times,</v>

4619
03:18:55.781 --> 03:18:58.810
<v Speaker 3>like you're going to fail at it and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>fail at it all the time where suddenly</v>

4620
03:18:58.930 --> 03:19:00.340
<v Speaker 3>three hours went by and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

4621
03:19:00.341 --> 03:19:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I just stared at twitter but three hours</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally just taking my dog for a walk</v>

4622
03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:08.780
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that that would just reset it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I feel better after that.</v>

4623
03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't do that,</v>

4624
03:19:10.240 --> 03:19:14.170
<v Speaker 3>it's taking that step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get yourself to take that step and just</v>

4625
03:19:14.171 --> 03:19:16.630
<v Speaker 3>once you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's usually pretty easy to do it.</v>

4626
03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Like once you're working out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty easy to be there once your</v>

4627
03:19:19.591 --> 03:19:20.231
<v Speaker 3>start like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4628
03:19:20.231 --> 03:19:22.090
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm doing now and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually started enjoying it.</v>

4629
03:19:22.091 --> 03:19:26.020
<v Speaker 3>It's making yourself take that step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know like this is a lot of times for</v>

4630
03:19:26.021 --> 03:19:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Yoga class where I'm like I could just</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay here.</v>

4631
03:19:28.470 --> 03:19:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I watch TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking put my feet up and do nothing.</v>

4632
03:19:31.451 --> 03:19:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling kind of sore.</v>

4633
03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your brain starts playing all these</v>

4634
03:19:35.231 --> 03:19:39.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind games with you but when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do go to yoga class and you take that</v>

4635
03:19:39.401 --> 03:19:41.350
<v Speaker 3>class in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 minutes later you've lost fucking</v>

4636
03:19:41.380 --> 03:19:44.740
<v Speaker 3>eight pounds of sweat and you've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>freaking out and almost blacking out.</v>

4637
03:19:44.890 --> 03:19:46.000
<v Speaker 3>When you get out of there you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

4638
03:19:46.030 --> 03:19:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel way better.</v>

4639
03:19:47.351 --> 03:19:52.351
<v Speaker 3>And it gives you also I think momentum</v>
<v Speaker 3>and motivation to continue with the rest</v>

4640
03:19:52.811 --> 03:19:55.180
<v Speaker 3>of your life too to keep pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

4641
03:19:55.320 --> 03:19:59.710
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you are your own boss</v>

4642
03:19:59.740 --> 03:20:01.330
<v Speaker 3>also?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause pretty much I,</v>

4643
03:20:01.331 --> 03:20:02.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you have outside gigs too,</v>

4644
03:20:02.741 --> 03:20:04.930
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 90% of what you do,</v>

4645
03:20:04.931 --> 03:20:07.390
<v Speaker 3>I would guess is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you are in charge of the,</v>

4646
03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:10.000
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate decisions if not 100%.</v>

4647
03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well not the UFC.</v>

4648
03:20:12.101 --> 03:20:14.930
<v Speaker 3>The UFC is my one job that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right.</v>

4649
03:20:15.210 --> 03:20:16.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a job,</v>

4650
03:20:16.541 --> 03:20:20.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's the greatest job I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he was a super pleasure.</v>

4651
03:20:20.500 --> 03:20:21.830
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4652
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:26.350
<v Speaker 3>it's an honor and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a massive obligation to respect</v>

4653
03:20:26.351 --> 03:20:30.460
<v Speaker 3>and represent the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>competing in what I think is one of the</v>

4654
03:20:30.461 --> 03:20:33.370
<v Speaker 3>most difficult physical endeavors in all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sports,</v>

4655
03:20:33.730 --> 03:20:36.670
<v Speaker 3>if not the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's incredibly difficult to do.</v>

4656
03:20:36.730 --> 03:20:40.300
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like I'm in a very privileged</v>
<v Speaker 3>position to represent those people.</v>

4657
03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:42.280
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it that I don't need it.</v>

4658
03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

4659
03:20:44.050 --> 03:20:45.010
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

4660
03:20:45.011 --> 03:20:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I like not having a boss man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though my boss is amazing,</v>

4661
03:20:48.250 --> 03:20:50.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that job was the greatest job of all</v>

4662
03:20:50.411 --> 03:20:53.350
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like doing things when I want to do</v>

4663
03:20:53.351 --> 03:20:55.840
<v Speaker 3>them too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like I'm lazy.</v>

4664
03:20:55.870 --> 03:20:58.850
<v Speaker 3>So I pushed myself to do a lot of shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

4665
03:20:59.010 --> 03:21:01.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have goals and accomplish them or</v>

4666
03:21:01.271 --> 03:21:02.530
<v Speaker 3>attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have,</v>

4667
03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:04.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>commitments as far as like writing and</v>

4668
03:21:04.840 --> 03:21:07.510
<v Speaker 3>performing and producing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

4669
03:21:07.870 --> 03:21:09.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being your own boss,</v>

4670
03:21:09.161 --> 03:21:10.510
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could pull it off,</v>

4671
03:21:10.511 --> 03:21:13.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like the greatest thing ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not work anymore.</v>

4672
03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:15.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're working for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>

4673
03:21:15.490 --> 03:21:17.690
<v Speaker 3>you're doing things instead of working</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

4674
03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:19.030
<v Speaker 3>punching in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4675
03:21:19.031 --> 03:21:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I went independent in June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's only,</v>

4676
03:21:22.091 --> 03:21:25.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even six months out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only was it the smartest</v>

4677
03:21:25.900 --> 03:21:29.560
<v Speaker 3>business decision I ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which partly was because I saw guys like</v>

4678
03:21:29.561 --> 03:21:31.970
<v Speaker 3>you and Corolla and a couple other guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will,</v>

4679
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.800
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

4680
03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:37.120
<v Speaker 3>They built great brands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have their fans and they're doing</v>

4681
03:21:37.121 --> 03:21:37.670
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

4682
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:38.500
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4683
03:21:38.500 --> 03:21:40.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actual template for this.</v>

4684
03:21:40.300 --> 03:21:42.190
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I built my audience correctly.</v>

4685
03:21:42.400 --> 03:21:44.740
<v Speaker 3>And I just took the risk and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4686
03:21:44.741 --> 03:21:45.890
<v Speaker 3>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

4687
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:47.900
<v Speaker 2>we know we launched this patrion</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>

4688
03:21:47.901 --> 03:21:50.060
<v Speaker 2>which is where fans can donate per</v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

4689
03:21:50.061 --> 03:21:51.170
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4690
03:21:51.171 --> 03:21:53.060
<v Speaker 2>do you do like two bucks to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>newsletter?</v>

4691
03:21:53.270 --> 03:21:56.420
<v Speaker 2>We people that donate 250 and I skyped</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them every month and like a whole</v>

4692
03:21:56.421 --> 03:21:59.120
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know when I woke up the next</v>

4693
03:21:59.120 --> 03:22:01.650
<v Speaker 2>morning after we launched it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might've been over my career,</v>

4694
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:04.790
<v Speaker 2>literally might've been over like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because I quit my job.</v>

4695
03:22:04.791 --> 03:22:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no job.</v>

4696
03:22:06.621 --> 03:22:07.940
<v Speaker 2>My producer had no job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My director,</v>

4697
03:22:07.941 --> 03:22:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I had no job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no insurance,</v>

4698
03:22:09.021 --> 03:22:13.610
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I woke up and our fans showed up and</v>

4699
03:22:13.611 --> 03:22:15.500
<v Speaker 2>they took care of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

4700
03:22:15.501 --> 03:22:18.770
<v Speaker 2>now in the six months since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I bought this House and build in the</v>

4701
03:22:18.771 --> 03:22:22.760
<v Speaker 2>studio and we're figuring out all other</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to to make deals and all that kind</v>

4702
03:22:22.761 --> 03:22:25.110
<v Speaker 2>of stuff and it's incorrect.</v>

4703
03:22:25.190 --> 03:22:27.860
<v Speaker 2>But I still wake up sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my point was I still wake up</v>

4704
03:22:27.861 --> 03:22:28.730
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

4705
03:22:28.731 --> 03:22:31.010
<v Speaker 2>So I have to answer to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a feeling it's just a</v>

4706
03:22:31.011 --> 03:22:31.791
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4707
03:22:31.791 --> 03:22:32.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4708
03:22:32.691 --> 03:22:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4709
03:22:34.360 --> 03:22:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I make the decision here and a way like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4710
03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:39.470
<v Speaker 2>that hunger that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

4711
03:22:39.471 --> 03:22:43.310
<v Speaker 2>that fear that to take that chance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do things,</v>

4712
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:46.760
<v Speaker 2>that's like one of the best things you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could ever have in life because it's the</v>

4713
03:22:46.761 --> 03:22:48.410
<v Speaker 2>motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

4714
03:22:48.470 --> 03:22:50.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're not like a woe is me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always going to be a loser.</v>

4715
03:22:50.961 --> 03:22:52.820
<v Speaker 2>If you're a person who really tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something,</v>

4716
03:22:52.850 --> 03:22:57.260
<v Speaker 2>risk taking is so God damn critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it forces you to action and it</v>

4717
03:22:57.261 --> 03:23:00.920
<v Speaker 2>forces you to be inspired and to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired up and that's when things really</v>

4718
03:23:00.921 --> 03:23:03.160
<v Speaker 2>take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is like that's,</v>

4719
03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:05.960
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things that Scott</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams had said sort of about the</v>

4720
03:23:05.961 --> 03:23:10.550
<v Speaker 2>election is that there's such chaos now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever happens after out of chaos,</v>

4721
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:12.230
<v Speaker 2>something new will happen.</v>

4722
03:23:12.270 --> 03:23:14.050
<v Speaker 2>May Not be good immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May Not be bad.</v>

4723
03:23:14.051 --> 03:23:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what that will be,</v>

4724
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:17.360
<v Speaker 2>but the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chance,</v>

4725
03:23:17.480 --> 03:23:20.210
<v Speaker 2>the risk will now allow for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else to happen.</v>

4726
03:23:20.211 --> 03:23:22.220
<v Speaker 2>So all these people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4727
03:23:22.221 --> 03:23:24.590
<v Speaker 2>all these pundits who got everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong for the last year,</v>

4728
03:23:24.591 --> 03:23:27.120
<v Speaker 2>and oh well it's going to be a rubio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be cruise,</v>

4729
03:23:27.180 --> 03:23:27.401
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

4730
03:23:27.401 --> 03:23:29.150
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they'll now tell you</v>

4731
03:23:29.151 --> 03:23:31.730
<v Speaker 2>everything else that there is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen for the next year and they're</v>

4732
03:23:31.731 --> 03:23:34.110
<v Speaker 2>going to get all that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But out of chaos,</v>

4733
03:23:34.240 --> 03:23:35.540
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I realized.</v>

4734
03:23:35.541 --> 03:23:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I had a path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a salary and I was doing fine.</v>

4735
03:23:37.821 --> 03:23:40.430
<v Speaker 2>And I liked working at Ora and Larry</v>
<v Speaker 2>King's been great to me and it was all</v>

4736
03:23:40.431 --> 03:23:43.340
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just had this feeling of like,</v>

4737
03:23:43.820 --> 03:23:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I gotta try this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to try this.</v>

4738
03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:48.230
<v Speaker 2>You get a very different position if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work,</v>

4739
03:23:48.231 --> 03:23:48.740
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4740
03:23:48.740 --> 03:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be that guy who just</v>

4741
03:23:50.871 --> 03:23:54.170
<v Speaker 2>wishes they took that chance and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still working for some company and they</v>

4742
03:23:54.171 --> 03:23:55.850
<v Speaker 2>still treat like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4743
03:23:55.851 --> 03:23:58.540
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4744
03:23:58.850 --> 03:24:00.680
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the person making the phones.</v>

4745
03:24:00.681 --> 03:24:03.800
<v Speaker 2>You're not the person with the idea and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person with the idea.</v>

4746
03:24:03.801 --> 03:24:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're a smart guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

4747
03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:11.180
<v Speaker 2>it's you do yourself a disservice if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't express yourself completely,</v>

4748
03:24:11.181 --> 03:24:16.040
<v Speaker 2>fully and without any reserve or any</v>
<v Speaker 2>reservations.</v>

4749
03:24:16.100 --> 03:24:18.110
<v Speaker 2>And when you work for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll always have a reservation.</v>

4750
03:24:18.111 --> 03:24:19.070
<v Speaker 2>You're always worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4751
03:24:19.071 --> 03:24:21.980
<v Speaker 2>You're always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always like biting your tongue or</v>

4752
03:24:21.981 --> 03:24:24.710
<v Speaker 2>flavoring your words or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come into your office and go,</v>

4753
03:24:24.711 --> 03:24:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been really hard on Clinton.</v>

4754
03:24:26.390 --> 03:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important for Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

4755
03:24:29.011 --> 03:24:33.830
<v Speaker 2>the produce a producer is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got Hashtag I'm with her on his</v>

4756
03:24:33.831 --> 03:24:36.590
<v Speaker 2>twitter account and we just wanted you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just think about doing that,</v>

4757
03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:39.380
<v Speaker 2>like criticized her if he choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but be balanced,</v>

4758
03:24:39.680 --> 03:24:41.620
<v Speaker 2>be balanced and you're being real like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4759
03:24:41.740 --> 03:24:43.410
<v Speaker 2>you're being silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also being real.</v>

4760
03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:46.740
<v Speaker 3>That is the real shit that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag I'm with her.</v>

4761
03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:47.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4762
03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:50.400
<v Speaker 3>you've got to have a Hashtag Jeanette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president of the company is going to</v>

4763
03:24:50.401 --> 03:24:52.710
<v Speaker 3>come down and talk to you about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things you said.</v>

4764
03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been kind of misogynist,</v>

4765
03:24:56.220 --> 03:24:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

4766
03:24:56.680 --> 03:24:59.070
<v Speaker 3>and maybe just a little bit unsupportive</v>
<v Speaker 3>of women's issues.</v>

4767
03:24:59.310 --> 03:25:01.590
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this company is very progressive and we</v>

4768
03:25:01.591 --> 03:25:05.010
<v Speaker 3>really feel strongly that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of shit that p that and you don't</v>

4769
03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:08.070
<v Speaker 3>get to very progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you should think exactly like you</v>

4770
03:25:08.071 --> 03:25:11.070
<v Speaker 3>have to be Dave Ruben with a mortgage</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's worried about losing his job,</v>

4771
03:25:11.260 --> 03:25:13.080
<v Speaker 3>then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good for business.</v>

4772
03:25:13.081 --> 03:25:15.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for thinking it's not good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for humans.</v>

4773
03:25:15.421 --> 03:25:17.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for the business of</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

4774
03:25:17.540 --> 03:25:19.070
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

4775
03:25:19.071 --> 03:25:21.060
<v Speaker 3>the endeavour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Endeavour of culture,</v>

4776
03:25:21.330 --> 03:25:25.770
<v Speaker 3>the endeavor of culture requires like</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of some sort of an open discourse,</v>

4777
03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:26.370
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4778
03:25:26.370 --> 03:25:28.650
<v Speaker 3>And that includes shit like wikileaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4779
03:25:28.651 --> 03:25:32.220
<v Speaker 3>That's a part of the open discourse when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell someone like Chelsea manning</v>

4780
03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:35.580
<v Speaker 3>that they can't let anybody know about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this horrific shit that's going on,</v>

4781
03:25:35.581 --> 03:25:36.570
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is illegal.</v>

4782
03:25:36.960 --> 03:25:39.090
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've set up this sort of a system</v>

4783
03:25:39.091 --> 03:25:41.010
<v Speaker 3>where you're stopping data from going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>

4784
03:25:41.011 --> 03:25:43.380
<v Speaker 3>You're stopping people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating and you're going to</v>

4785
03:25:43.381 --> 03:25:47.940
<v Speaker 3>ultimately stop people from expressing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their opinions on what was communicated,</v>

4786
03:25:47.941 --> 03:25:50.340
<v Speaker 3>which is going to stop progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Russian hacker,</v>

4787
03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:55.410
<v Speaker 3>the shit must be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just stuck pot smoking hippies,</v>

4788
03:25:56.130 --> 03:26:00.300
<v Speaker 3>but no hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us are just fucking people.</v>

4789
03:26:00.330 --> 03:26:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Dave Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's one of the things</v>

4790
03:26:02.131 --> 03:26:06.150
<v Speaker 3>that's going to come out when the dust</v>
<v Speaker 3>settles and we pick a new king or queen,</v>

4791
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:09.420
<v Speaker 3>we're going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything's going to happen now that we</v>

4792
03:26:09.421 --> 03:26:11.730
<v Speaker 3>been talking to is going to win and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going to hate her and it's</v>

4793
03:26:11.731 --> 03:26:16.731
<v Speaker 3>going to be record record number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are intolerant and say crazy</v>

4794
03:26:17.221 --> 03:26:19.530
<v Speaker 3>shit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to have to all figure</v>

4795
03:26:19.531 --> 03:26:20.490
<v Speaker 3>out a way to get along.</v>

4796
03:26:21.090 --> 03:26:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Do you see any situation where we wake</v>
<v Speaker 3>up tomorrow night that trump's</v>

4797
03:26:24.841 --> 03:26:26.670
<v Speaker 3>president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% yeah.</v>

4798
03:26:26.700 --> 03:26:27.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

4799
03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:29.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think.</v>

4800
03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I think most likely Hillary's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>

4801
03:26:31.681 --> 03:26:36.681
<v Speaker 3>But I absolutely could see just some</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant fuck up where the mass media has</v>

4802
03:26:38.461 --> 03:26:42.720
<v Speaker 3>been lied to by polls and by public</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>

4803
03:26:42.721 --> 03:26:46.350
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think necessarily polls are</v>
<v Speaker 3>very accurate anymore because I don't</v>

4804
03:26:46.351 --> 03:26:48.180
<v Speaker 3>think people choose to take polls very</v>
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>

4805
03:26:48.240 --> 03:26:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Mostly call land lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time you had an exact a</v>

4806
03:26:51.331 --> 03:26:53.880
<v Speaker 3>mundo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a joke about that in my last</v>

4807
03:26:53.881 --> 03:26:55.060
<v Speaker 3>special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

4808
03:26:55.380 --> 03:26:59.880
<v Speaker 3>like maybe you're dealing with 1%,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the problem with polls is the</v>

4809
03:26:59.881 --> 03:27:01.540
<v Speaker 3>people who answer polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4810
03:27:01.590 --> 03:27:03.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been pulled?</v>

4811
03:27:03.361 --> 03:27:04.194
<v Speaker 3>Ever?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

4812
03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:05.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

4813
03:27:05.041 --> 03:27:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

4814
03:27:05.931 --> 03:27:09.090
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing that we're doing here</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're basing that on Poles.</v>

4815
03:27:09.090 --> 03:27:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Exit polls are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit different,</v>

4816
03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:13.090
<v Speaker 3>but that was way off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4817
03:27:13.170 --> 03:27:15.410
<v Speaker 3>during with Al Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4818
03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the predicted Al Gore to be,</v>

4819
03:27:17.220 --> 03:27:18.960
<v Speaker 3>apparently he was like the popular</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter,</v>

4820
03:27:18.961 --> 03:27:22.590
<v Speaker 3>right when he won the popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't he run,</v>

4821
03:27:23.130 --> 03:27:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Fuck's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not a huge,</v>

4822
03:27:24.631 --> 03:27:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very cool to say like,</v>

4823
03:27:27.090 --> 03:27:29.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an outdoor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4824
03:27:29.220 --> 03:27:30.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what Al Gore did?</v>

4825
03:27:30.631 --> 03:27:33.690
<v Speaker 3>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he created current television.</v>

4826
03:27:33.691 --> 03:27:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that,</v>

4827
03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:36.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then eventually when he,</v>

4828
03:27:36.781 --> 03:27:39.420
<v Speaker 3>it was a failure as a network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was purging money.</v>

4829
03:27:39.500 --> 03:27:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he had a choice.</v>

4830
03:27:40.591 --> 03:27:42.160
<v Speaker 3>He could see you had a couple offers</v>

4831
03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:43.750
<v Speaker 2>on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have sold it to Glenn Beck,</v>

4832
03:27:43.780 --> 03:27:45.700
<v Speaker 2>but I guess he doesn't like Glenn's back</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

4833
03:27:45.701 --> 03:27:47.830
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sold it to Al Jazeera,</v>

4834
03:27:47.860 --> 03:27:52.390
<v Speaker 2>which is owned by the government of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qatar that puts out more fossil fuel,</v>

4835
03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:53.860
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage,</v>

4836
03:27:53.861 --> 03:27:55.930
<v Speaker 2>the same stuff that he rails against all</v>
<v Speaker 2>day long.</v>

4837
03:27:56.110 --> 03:27:58.300
<v Speaker 2>And he sold him that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he basically did the producers,</v>

4838
03:27:58.450 --> 03:28:02.580
<v Speaker 2>he used all his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of his connections and money as a</v>

4839
03:28:02.581 --> 03:28:06.100
<v Speaker 2>vice president to get a network on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>air because it's incredibly hard to get</v>

4840
03:28:06.101 --> 03:28:08.860
<v Speaker 2>into the cable system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he used all his leverage to get</v>

4841
03:28:08.861 --> 03:28:10.180
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created a failure.</v>

4842
03:28:10.181 --> 03:28:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And he walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with $500 million and it was all</v>

4843
03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:16.900
<v Speaker 2>funded Qatar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was in many ways funded by his</v>

4844
03:28:16.901 --> 03:28:20.190
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian campaign to alert the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dangers of global one.</v>

4845
03:28:20.191 --> 03:28:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what gave him credibility.</v>

4846
03:28:22.210 --> 03:28:23.620
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a cosby situation.</v>

4847
03:28:24.470 --> 03:28:27.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on that note,</v>

4848
03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:29.420
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna wrap it up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Rubin.</v>

4849
03:28:29.421 --> 03:28:32.170
<v Speaker 2>That was just a three and a half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4850
03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly had no idea.</v>

4851
03:28:33.671 --> 03:28:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm on stage or when I'm doing my</v>

4852
03:28:35.411 --> 03:28:36.880
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no sense of time.</v>

4853
03:28:36.910 --> 03:28:38.530
<v Speaker 2>So don't do three and a half hour shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

4854
03:28:38.531 --> 03:28:41.320
<v Speaker 2>People get pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at their wall with the longest</v>

4855
03:28:41.321 --> 03:28:41.981
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

4856
03:28:41.981 --> 03:28:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Was it sam?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four hours.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What's your longest one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done some long fucking podcast in</v>

4861
03:28:51.371 --> 03:28:52.930
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't shut the fuck up.</v>

4862

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
