<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Like I would love to watch Tyron Woodley versus Damien Maia.</v>

4
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I would love to watch it.</v>

6
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>That would be that.</v>

7
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>That to me is maybe one of the most interesting fights on,</v>

8
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>on the horizon for me so far,</v>

9
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Damien Maia has been able to take down wrestlers that exact 70.</v>

10
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>He's been able to take them all down.</v>

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Like easy and just the beautiful technique and uh,</v>

13
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but can you do that to Woodley and you've got to go?</v>

14
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

15
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>You got to go through the storm,</v>

16
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the storm of fucking meteors coming.</v>

17
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Your way that Woodley drops on you.</v>

18
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's the most dangerous in that first round.</v>

19
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.551
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>

20
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to take him down,</v>

21
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you're closing the distance on them and you haven't like figured out how fast he</v>

22
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>is yet because he's not,</v>

23
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't just hit hard.</v>

24
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking fast.</v>

25
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.611
<v Speaker 1>I saw some,</v>

26
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>just rumor,</v>

28
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:49.771
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

29
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>but a Brisbane was talking about it.</v>

30
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Him and Woodley a grand a Superfight at one 80.</v>

31
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

32
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Bisbing being Woodley real.</v>

33
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>When did they agree to this?</v>

34
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my brothers sworn he was like,</v>

36
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you see Woodley and Bisbing want to do that catch weight at one 80.</v>

37
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

38
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting fight.</v>

39
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>First of all convincing,</v>

40
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>make that healthy.</v>

41
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking.</v>

42
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause five's a tough cut for,</v>

43
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he used to fight 2:05 PM two oh five.</v>

44
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

45
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

46
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting fight.</v>

47
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Well I think what,</v>

48
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>what would they want is that big payday?</v>

49
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

50
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.843
<v Speaker 1>let's not,</v>

51
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

52
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's campaigning for it.</v>

53
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

54
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Mike Bisbee and Tyrone Woodley agree to catch weight.</v>

55
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>This is legit.</v>

56
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's just happened today on the Internet.</v>

57
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>What is the name of the,</v>

58
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>the Internet low kick,</v>

60
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>mma.com.</v>

61
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

62
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>That's Bisbing through Instagram and shirt.</v>

63
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

64
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.843
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

65
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>So a gangster weight as Chael Sonnen calls it.</v>

66
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:45.864
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

68
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.973
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

69
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>But like to your point,</v>

70
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Woodley just wants a big fight for lucrative payday.</v>

71
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.961
<v Speaker 1>That's all he wants.</v>

72
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>The biggest name possible to get paid.</v>

73
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:54.271
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>

75
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the name of the game and the Anderson back.</v>

76
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>and that has been still been calling for a rematch with a Bisbing to cause his</v>

78
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>fight with Bisbing was so fucking close in England.</v>

79
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>He feels like he beat him.</v>

80
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.130
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the craziest situations.</v>

81
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Several years.</v>

82
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>He hits him with that flying neat.</v>

83
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:09.954
<v Speaker 1>Kaos awesome.</v>

84
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:11.304
<v Speaker 1>Bisping was out.</v>

86
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.271
<v Speaker 1>He went out,</v>

87
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>he dropped and Anderson does a walk off K on they go,</v>

88
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

89
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>not so quick.</v>

90
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It was so weird.</v>

91
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.223
<v Speaker 1>So weird.</v>

92
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

93
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh why does that make get a video of that?</v>

94
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Cause remember Bisbing takes a break cause his mouthpiece falls out and he's</v>

95
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>like talking to the ref and Anderson goes,</v>

96
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>oh that's right.</v>

97
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

98
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

99
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to get the referees at tension and Anderson Flying Nita and the</v>

100
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>ref like coming in to stop it than Ashton did that flying knee.</v>

101
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:38.251
<v Speaker 1>That's why the ref was like,</v>

102
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:38.671
<v Speaker 1>hold up.</v>

103
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:38.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

104
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't look at that.</v>

105
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>That's very weird.</v>

106
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Cities being boxed his fucking face off.</v>

107
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.810

108
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.640

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

113
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

114
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>That was also the end of the round two,</v>

115
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:53.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

116
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

118
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:54.991
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

119
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:55.824
<v Speaker 1>look at this again.</v>

120
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

121
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.851
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

122
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>let me get my mouth PC.</v>

123
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

124
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

125
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>So look at this.</v>

126
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

127
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>That is such a crazy drop to the way you get hit,</v>

128
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>thrown the knee regardless whether he looked to the side or not,</v>

130
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I think he would have thrown it regardless.</v>

131
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like Bisbing put his hands down.</v>

132
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.901
<v Speaker 1>He looked over,</v>

133
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>but he was still covered up.</v>

134
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's the crazy thing that I think he was a little distracted there for sure.</v>

135
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Here's the crazy thing.</v>

136
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Bisbing comes back and wins that fucking fight face off.</v>

137
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>How'd you in that actually comes out that,</v>

138
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the third round,</v>

139
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:29.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

140
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>He comes out that fourth round and his face off crazy.</v>

141
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Like a fucking kangaroo crazy recovery.</v>

142
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>That means unbeliefs.</v>

143
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Cardiovert insane.</v>

144
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

145
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>because most people get hit like that.</v>

146
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:40.511
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

147
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.344
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

148
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

149
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>his body shut off and he dropped.</v>

150
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

151
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the power would give us a second and we're back,</v>

152
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but partially blind in one eye or completely.</v>

153
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Partially.</v>

154
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>But he could still see,</v>

156
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>he can see enough where they let him fight.</v>

157
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.783
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

158
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

159
00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean he does those dye tests.</v>

160
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>They have to do I test.</v>

161
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Apparently what they did is they put some kind of oil in his eye and that oil</v>

162
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>like protects his retina somehow or another.</v>

163
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it looks so crazy.</v>

164
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>And once he's done fighting,</v>

165
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>then they'll fix it.</v>

166
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is like if he gets it fixed now and then he goes and fights</v>

167
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>again and tears it even worse.</v>

168
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is,</v>

169
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>the more time he waits,</v>

170
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>the more advanced all the stem cells shit is getting.</v>

171
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Like they write,</v>

172
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>they brought someone's vision back with stem cells applying guy.</v>

173
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Someone was blind and they injected stem cells in this guy's eye and brought his</v>

174
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>vision back there.</v>

175
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's today,</v>

176
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>2017 what's it going to be like five,</v>

177
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.131
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

178
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.200
<v Speaker 1>seven years down the line.</v>

179
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And this may be retired by then.</v>

180
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I would hope be be retired three or four.</v>

181
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

182
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I think he's 39 now,</v>

183
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.204
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

184
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.253

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

187
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I might not be that old.</v>

188
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:47.141
<v Speaker 1>I might be,</v>

189
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I might be a up in them up a bit.</v>

190
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>36 it might be (373) 063-0730 seven I don't think he has three years left.</v>

191
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:56.871
<v Speaker 1>he might say,</v>

193
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:57.071
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

194
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:57.341

195
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:57.511
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

196
00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking game.</v>

197
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

198
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bisbing does not have any extraordinary physical attributes and not that</v>

199
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:03.911
<v Speaker 1>he's not a great athlete.</v>

200
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>He certainly is not.</v>

201
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.411
<v Speaker 1>He's done a very good fighter.</v>

202
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>He certainly is,</v>

203
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but cardio.</v>

204
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at a guy like rumble,</v>

205
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary physical attributes,</v>

206
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>John Linacre,</v>

207
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary physical attributes.</v>

208
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Well Michael Bisping has is just toughness.</v>

209
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Just game as Foc,</v>

210

212
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 1>He comes back and he just keeps coming back.</v>

213
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no quit and there's not any,</v>

214
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.341
<v Speaker 1>is great.</v>

215
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Cardio is no quick,</v>

216
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>amazing cardio.</v>

217
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Parson says in the gym,</v>

218
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.160
<v Speaker 1>he said he's never seen a guy that hates getting tapped and hates losing more</v>

219
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>exchanges more.</v>

220
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like it.</v>

221
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.770

<v Speaker 1>That much harder to tell you something.</v>

268
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I had a funny feeling about Luke Rockhold.</v>

269
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Luke was taking it seriously.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't that you think your days and I'm like this.</v>

271
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.050
<v Speaker 1>He already beat them as being too for fucking years.</v>

272
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>All he needs is one shot,</v>

273
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but business name a knockout artists like the bedding art for him to knock Luke</v>

274
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold on the first round.</v>

277
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 1>If my daughter catches you in one of those swinging overhand punches and clips</v>
