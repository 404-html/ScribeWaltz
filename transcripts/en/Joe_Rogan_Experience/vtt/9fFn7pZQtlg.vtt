1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 2>But I also think like,</v>

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 2>especially with these videos that have been coming up,</v>

4
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 2>just women attacking and like Anthony gets saying,</v>

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 2>that woman said that he was going to,</v>

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 2>that woman has got like if he called the police was going to say that he was</v>

7
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 2>raped,</v>

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 2>she was raped or you know,</v>

9
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 2>attacking her</v>

10
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.441
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

11
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:15.961
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said,</v>

12
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:16.591
<v Speaker 1>that she said that,</v>

13
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:16.891
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>when she was hitting him,</v>

15
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that she was going to say that he sexually assaulted her.</v>

16
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

17
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.871
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

18
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 2>it's the opiate Anthony thing.</v>

19
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

20
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>The opie and Anthony thing,</v>

22
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:26.264
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know,</v>

23
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>our friends open,</v>

25
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.671
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Anthony.</v>

26
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:28.881
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

27
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.881
<v Speaker 1>Mia was in New York City and he was taking photographs and they got a photograph</v>

28
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>of a woman and this woman got very upset.</v>

29
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>He took a photograph of her,</v>

30
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>so some sort of an altercation took place.</v>

31
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.141
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>some words were exchanged and she started hitting him.</v>

33
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>So she was hitting him.</v>

34
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know Anthony,</v>

35
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't know that he's a gun nut and like a legit gun,</v>

36
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>not who actually has a license to conceal carry in New York City,</v>

37
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>which is incredibly difficult to obtain.</v>

38
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>But here's one strike for,</v>

39
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>people who want people to have guns.</v>

41
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Anthony never pulled out that gun,</v>

42
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>never it'd be it.</v>

43
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>He obviously felt threatened.</v>

44
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>He was getting hit by this one woman who,</v>

45
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Anthony is a nice guy,</v>

46
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>but he is,</v>

47
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>51 years old,</v>

49
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>loves his drinking and I don't think he lifts weights that much.</v>

50
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's just like big scary,</v>

51
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Quentin Jackson,</v>

53
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>rampage Jackson looking dude,</v>

54
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

56
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>he's a thin guy.</v>

57
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>He's not a,</v>

58
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>not a physically imposing guy and this chick is beaten on him and he's got a gun</v>

59
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:35.744
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

60
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

61
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>

62
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>So obviously I don't know what the tone of the situation was.</v>

63
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it got started.</v>

64
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

65
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I've read very little about it other than he went on this rampage calling her an</v>

66
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>animal and a cunt and all this,</v>

67
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.223
<v Speaker 1>all these different,</v>

68
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>but what's,</v>

69
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>what's hilarious is everything that he said and his Twitter rampage that they're</v>

70
00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:01.901
<v Speaker 1>firing him before he said on the radio show and they hired him for</v>

71
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 1>the radio show.</v>

72
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:10.331
<v Speaker 1>If you paid attention to what he said over the years and why he's entertaining</v>

73
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 1>and how he says it,</v>

74
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>he gets crazy about racial situations.</v>

75
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>He gets crazy about certain aspects of the African American community and he's</v>

76
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>done it forever.</v>

77
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And so these things that he said after getting punched that they were surprising</v>

78
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>to serious who had heard him say these things and they gave him checks.</v>

79
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hilarious.</v>

80
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And also like one of the things that people are pointing out all over la all</v>

81
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:37.221
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

82
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the Twitter sphere is they're showing all these lyrics to rap songs that Sirius</v>

84
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 1>has aired since Anthony got fired for tweeting.</v>

85
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>And the lyrics are ridiculous.</v>

86
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

87
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.091
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

88
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:50.391
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

89
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it's hardcore rap.</v>

90
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

91
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>they air hardcore rap lyrics.</v>

92
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.191
<v Speaker 1>So they've got,</v>

93
00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:55.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 1>nigger this and shoot,</v>

95
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>suck my dick and this bitch that pitches and you know that the craziest,</v>

96
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>most radical,</v>

97
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.044
<v Speaker 1>hip hop shit.</v>

99
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And yet Anthony gets in trouble for this thing that he did where he went on his</v>

100
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Twitter rampage and said a bunch of shit that he's,</v>

101
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could.</v>

102
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I bet if someone was a real opie and Anthony Fan,</v>

103
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.420
<v Speaker 1>you could probably go back through all the opiate Anthony shows and pieced</v>

104
00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:26.421
<v Speaker 1>together him actually saying those words that are in those tweets</v>

105
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.551
<v Speaker 3>that's serious,</v>

106
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 3>makes money off of racist.</v>

107
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.711
<v Speaker 3>That's serious.</v>

108
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:30.544
<v Speaker 3>Makes money off of it.</v>

109
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.001
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

110
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.751
<v Speaker 3>you know what man,</v>

111
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.584
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

112
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

113
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is that these companies get really terrified of the Twitter</v>

114
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.474
<v Speaker 3>storm.</v>

115
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

116
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.591
<v Speaker 3>They get like,</v>

117
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 3>you saw that with a,</v>

118
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

119
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 3>you see it all the time with the sponsors for rush Limbaugh,</v>

120
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 3>but you see it with,</v>

121
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 3>or I believe conservative radio in general.</v>

122
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:47.104
<v Speaker 3>You see it with,</v>

123
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

124
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 3>like Donald Trump had a,</v>

125
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.871
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was,</v>

126
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 3>a tie collection or some shit at Macy's.</v>

127
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Then there are all these people on Twitter,</v>

128
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 3>like tweeting the Macy's account,</v>

129
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 3>like don't support him because I don't remember what the issue was,</v>

130
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

131
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 3>once it gets going,</v>

132
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 3>the company feels overwhelmed and they're like,</v>

133
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 3>we have to respond because a thousand people just retweeted this thing and they,</v>

134
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 3>I think they just feel like the best route is the 48 laws of power thing where</v>

135
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 3>you just put a head on the chopping block and,</v>

136
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 3>and think later.</v>

137
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

138
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I see their point of view.</v>

139
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I do if you,</v>

140
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they were fans of the opie and Anthony Show.</v>

141
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thinks part of what's going on.</v>

142
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they listened.</v>

143
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I think there weren't a lot of people complaining.</v>

144
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the money coming in.</v>

145
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a great show.</v>

146
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason why we're doing this show.</v>

147
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we're doing these shows because of opie and Anthony.</v>

148
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

149
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:32.414
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways.</v>

150
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a direct chain of influences.</v>

151
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.051
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>one of them being Tom Green,</v>

153
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Tom Green had his own show in his house way back in the day.</v>

154
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And I remember going over there and be like,</v>

155
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>this is the craziest shit ever.</v>

156
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>He's got server room,</v>

157
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>he's got a Goddamn server room with cables all through his living room and he</v>

158
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>turned his living room into a television show.</v>

159
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>He just did a little too early.</v>

160
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>He had a great innovative idea.</v>

161
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>He did it a little too early.</v>

162
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>That influenced us.</v>

163
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Kumina influenced me greatly when he did live at the compound.</v>

164
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>

165
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>he does this thing live at the compound where he set up a studio in his house in</v>

166
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Long Island and in his,</v>

167
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.751
<v Speaker 1>in his basement,</v>

168
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>he has a green screen and he'll fucking sing while he's holding guns.</v>

169
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

170
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>he's singing songs.</v>

171
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>He's singing karaoke while he's holding assault rifles.</v>

172
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

173
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

174
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they have a page,</v>

175
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but that shit is hilarious.</v>

176
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And I saw him doing that while he was still on opiate Anthony who was doing it</v>

177
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>just for fun and I was like,</v>

178
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.951
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

179
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:27.600
<v Speaker 1>this is genius.</v>

180
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>He set up a green screen.</v>

181
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.651
<v Speaker 1>He set up an a,</v>

182
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 1>a real like professional stage with a green screen and behind the green screen</v>

183
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>he would have like video of Manhattan or he would have like,</v>

184
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>like I was going to totally steal that idea.</v>

185
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I might still put a green screen behind me for a w if we do get that tri quarter</v>

186
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Speaker 1>cried tri caster thing that we'll do it.</v>

187
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>In respect to Anthony,</v>

188
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a big part of what they do and the ethic of the Internet.</v>

189
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:56.191
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be like the social ethic seems to be evolving way quicker,</v>

190
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 1>way stronger than at anytime that I can ever remember in in cultural history.</v>

191
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I never remember these like big movements shifts and how people talked and</v>

192
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>behaved in the words that were accepted in the words that weren't accepted and</v>

193
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:15.581
<v Speaker 1>and just w w just these giant trends that take place in just wash through</v>

195
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.051
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

196
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>

197
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>they didn't move this quick before.</v>

198
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>It's because we practice like a thought mass correction,</v>

199
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not entirely convinced it's a good thing yet.</v>

200
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't really decided if it's good or bad,</v>

201
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at that woman who took the flight from London to South Africa</v>

202
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 1>and tweeted out that insensitive shit about like,</v>

203
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>like I hope I don't get aids when I land in Africa or something.</v>

205
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

206
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.720
<v Speaker 1>she finished it though.</v>

207
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>She said just kidding.</v>

208
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm white.</v>

209
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

210
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>So is he even even worse?</v>

212
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 1>So Buffy were better.</v>

213
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>You mean that that's what made it funny.</v>

214
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Before her flight landed in South Africa,</v>

215
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I think she's already lost her job and the global uproar.</v>

216
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>So that person learned that this is not socially acceptable.</v>

217
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And why did they learn that?</v>

218
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Because the Internet gave them that lesson.</v>

219
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

220
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>she should have been a comedian because that would have been fucking hilarious.</v>

221
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

222
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>if a really funny comedian said that like a license last year said that when she</v>

223
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.491
<v Speaker 1>went to Africa,</v>

224
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.231
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

225
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.064
<v Speaker 1>that would be funny.</v>

226
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Is it the wrong thing to say?</v>

227
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

228
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It most certainly.</v>

229
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

230
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>But if you work in PR for some,</v>

231
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a,</v>

232
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to say the company,</v>

233
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but just a big media company.</v>

234
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>So you think she was on pills or something?</v>

235
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Like why was she fucking say,</v>

236
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.283
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

237
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.381
<v Speaker 1>what did what,</v>

238
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:24.010
<v Speaker 1>how could a person with in corporate America thing,</v>

239
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to put some on your Twitter.</v>

240
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.661
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

241
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Kidding.</v>

242
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

243
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:28.184
<v Speaker 1>I'm white.</v>

244
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.443
<v Speaker 1>Lol.</v>

245
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Hope we don't get aids.</v>

246
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.691
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>

247
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:33.524
<v Speaker 1>I'm white.</v>

248
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

249
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

250
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy person.</v>

251
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.503
<v Speaker 1>It's funny though.</v>

252
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Still funny.</v>

253
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thing to say,</v>

254
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but the point is like crazy people are being called out.</v>

255
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:43.551
<v Speaker 1>There's still crazy,</v>

256
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:43.851
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

257
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>we can call them out.</v>

258
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to ruin a lot.</v>

259
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Good jokes.</v>

260
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You are a lot of jobs.</v>

261
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>People are losing their jobs like Anthony just for going off Twitter.</v>

262
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

263
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.411
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

264
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>the Anthony thing is,</v>

265
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

266
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly weird because that's sort of why he had been known for that.</v>

267
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys had a show where it was like,</v>

268
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>there were openly joking about racism all the time.</v>

269
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Like the other day he had Amy Schumer on one of the best of shows.</v>

270
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It was from years ago and they were talking about interracial porn and Amy</v>

271
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Schumer was fucking hilarious.</v>

272
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 1>But she was saying that she,</v>

273
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>she was so funny.</v>

274
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

275
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun and she's so sharp.</v>

276
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

277
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that she's never fucked a black guy,</v>

278
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>but she likes watching black on white porn and uh,</v>

279
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Anthony was talking about,</v>

280
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

281
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.630
<v Speaker 1>how sad it was and that uh,</v>

282
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.221
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

283
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

284
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>his racism won't let him watch it.</v>

285
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Like his racism won't let him watch,</v>

286
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

287
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>a black guy fucking a white girl.</v>

288
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

289
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 2>There is a certain that is pretty racist if you can't,</v>

290
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>if you can't handle a black man fucking a white person,</v>

291
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.013
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty,</v>

292
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.651
<v Speaker 2>he's joking.</v>

293
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 2>He is a comedian.</v>

294
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people forget it.</v>

295
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a comedy show that he's one of the funniest people I know.</v>

296
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:55.260
<v Speaker 2>That just doesn't go on stage.</v>

297
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:55.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

298
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

299
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

300
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.820
<v Speaker 1>There's most certainly a comedian,</v>

301
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.150
<v Speaker 1>whether he goes on stage in front of a live audience or whether he goes,</v>

302
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.280
<v Speaker 1>do you think his rampage was meant to be funny though?</v>

303
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

304
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.901
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

305
00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:05.920
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>

306
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:06.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

307
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not done for entertainment or for then you're not,</v>

308
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.270
<v Speaker 1>then your profession doesn't really matter.</v>

309
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.330
<v Speaker 1>My issue with all these things,</v>

310
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:13.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

311
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.030
<v Speaker 1>is that like many things in life,</v>

312
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.110
<v Speaker 1>they're not black and white.</v>

313
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:17.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:18.850
<v Speaker 1>this is not black and white.</v>

315
00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I think Anthony is awesome.</v>

316
00:09:19.961 --> 00:09:20.794
<v Speaker 1>I love that dude.</v>

317
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.680
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my favorite people on radio ever.</v>

318
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:24.843
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

319
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.230
<v Speaker 1>He's just funny as shit.</v>

320
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.640
<v Speaker 1>He's smart as fuck.</v>

321
00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:29.860
<v Speaker 1>He knows a lot of things about different things.</v>

322
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:30.694
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

323
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.680
<v Speaker 1>he's very interesting the way he looks at the world.</v>

324
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.170
<v Speaker 1>He says a lot of crazy shit about black people.</v>

325
00:09:35.171 --> 00:09:35.711
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

326
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:36.820
<v Speaker 1>He has for a long time.</v>

327
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his personal experiences.</v>

328
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's around,</v>

329
00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:45.340
<v Speaker 1>where he's formulated these ideas about certain black people.</v>

330
00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 1>But I also know that he has a lot of black friends.</v>

331
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Patrice and him were close.</v>

332
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

333
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

334
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.760
<v Speaker 1>black comics that come on the show all the time,</v>

336
00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:52.430
<v Speaker 1>that a friendly with him.</v>

337
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.740
<v Speaker 1>He's not a mean person.</v>

338
00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>He's not a bad guy.</v>

339
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.170
<v Speaker 1>If you're a nice person,</v>

340
00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:57.190
<v Speaker 1>he'll be nice to you too.</v>

341
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.443
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

342
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck went down that night.</v>

343
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

344
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

345
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:01.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

346
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did get attacked,</v>

347
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 2>which is just crazy,</v>

348
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 2>but he's leading up to it.</v>

349
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 2>He also used to always talk about statistics about his city in New York and</v>

350
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:10.501
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that,</v>

351
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>

352
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

353
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

354
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:12.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

355
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:12.841
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

356
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 2>the race issues with that.</v>

357
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that what he,</v>

358
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.791
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't,</v>

359
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:18.541
<v Speaker 2>when he went off,</v>

360
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 2>he didn't really say all blacks are this,</v>

361
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:22.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:27.591
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of just talking about the person that attacked and was a savage,</v>

363
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:28.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

364
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:29.514
<v Speaker 2>it was what he said.</v>

365
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>He called her a continent,</v>

366
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:32.200
<v Speaker 1>an animal and all this different shit.</v>

367
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.300
<v Speaker 1>If it was a white chick and he called her an animal,</v>

368
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.090
<v Speaker 1>he would have been fun.</v>

369
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 2>And we would have called her the same exact word.</v>

371
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

372
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.571
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

373
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.860
<v Speaker 1>it's all very tricky.</v>

374
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:40.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

375
00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:41.450
<v Speaker 1>when I always say about when,</v>

376
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.140
<v Speaker 1>whenever you see a situation where two people get into a fight,</v>

377
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not always just one guy's fault.</v>

378
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's both guys fault.</v>

379
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes one a different person.</v>

380
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you talk to this guy,</v>

381
00:10:53.631 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>it would have never turned into a violent altercation and maybe you would have</v>

382
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>walked away shaking hands.</v>

383
00:10:58.581 --> 00:10:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Sorry man.</v>

384
00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

385
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.173
<v Speaker 1>no worries dude.</v>

386
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.270
<v Speaker 1>And another guy talking to the same guy.</v>

387
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It might lead to a bloody fist fight and it's just a matter of how do you</v>

388
00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>communicate with people?</v>

389
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Who is this woman?</v>

390
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

391
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York City with this chick that I was dating.</v>

392
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Speaker 1>We were walking down the street and this girl was so nice.</v>

393
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.310
<v Speaker 1>She was so nice.</v>

394
00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:16.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

395
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:16.731
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

396
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

397
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.451
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't,</v>

398
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't be mean to anyone ever.</v>

399
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.900
<v Speaker 1>No mean faces.</v>

400
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>She didn't have anything like that in her.</v>

401
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

402
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.181
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

403

410
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.630
<v Speaker 1>she's just decided that that was her spot.</v>

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>But that happens.</v>

434
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>There's black assholes out there just like there's white hassles out there.</v>

435
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>There's Chinese assholes out there,</v>

436
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

437
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make me racist.</v>

438
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 1>That makes me scared of people that are assholes and they come in all forms,</v>

439
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:29.381
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

440
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:29.601
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

441
00:12:29.601 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a Boston neighborhood,</v>

442
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.801
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica.</v>

443
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:33.720
<v Speaker 1>There was Jamaica plain,</v>

444
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>the place where I lived at before I moved to Newton,</v>

445
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 1>which was our cushy and Nice Jamaica plain was Phil with his Irish savages.</v>

446
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.160
<v Speaker 1>They were dangerous fucking kids.</v>

447
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>These dangerous Irish kids.</v>

448
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you ran into him like they,</v>

449
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it didn't matter what race they were,</v>

450
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:47.501

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 1>who's the savage?</v>

453
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.530
<v Speaker 1>These guilds kids were savages.</v>

454
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Didn't matter if they were white or Chinese.</v>

455
00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

456
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you walked down the wrong street in Chinatown and you run into some crazy</v>

457
00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Chinese gang that wants to fuck you up,</v>

458
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy.</v>

459
00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:58.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

460
00:12:58.931 --> 00:12:59.171
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

461
00:12:59.171 --> 00:12:59.441
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

462
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not better that way.</v>

463
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:02.200
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of races.</v>

464
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Every race contains savages.</v>

465
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Every race contains assholes,</v>

466
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.641
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

467
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is when it's a black person,</v>

468
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.020
<v Speaker 1>it's getting attacked by white guy.</v>

469
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:11.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

470
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:15.610
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be real specific that it's that person that's a piece of shit.</v>

471
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And if some other people jumped in,</v>

472
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 1>it's them that are pieces of shit.</v>

473
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not the whole town.</v>

474
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not all black people.</v>

475
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

476
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 1>it's just there's a certain type of person,</v>

478
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>whether it's white or black or whatever.</v>

479
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a piece of shit,</v>

480
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:28.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it's this lady,</v>

482
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

483
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>who knows what happened to her that that day,</v>

484
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:34.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>who knows what happened to her,</v>

486
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's going on in her life.</v>

487
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden this guy's taking pictures at her.</v>

488
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>She wants to punch him in the face.</v>

489
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember what time it was?</v>

490
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

491
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

492
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I forgot to look to see actually what time it occurred,</v>

493
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was around two to 3:00 AM wearing the Twitter happens.</v>

494
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

495
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

496
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

497
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 2>I understand he's,</v>

499
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at his photos on Instagram,</v>

500
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 2>he was taking a lot of photos of the city,</v>

501
00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:58.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot of photos of cops and construction workers and,</v>

502
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.923
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

503
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I get having a great camera,</v>

504
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

505
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

506
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.670
<v Speaker 2>that you're playing,</v>

507
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.010
<v Speaker 2>like New York's empty and you're downtown.</v>

508
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 2>And you're taking photo and though a woman's walking in the distance,</v>

509
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:09.191
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

510
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:09.761
<v Speaker 2>you're taking her,</v>

511
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 2>cause it's a photo.</v>

512
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

513
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

514
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.461
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

515
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:12.701
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

516
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

517
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened here,</v>

518
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:17.300
<v Speaker 2>but what does seem to happen that he,</v>

519
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.380
<v Speaker 2>she did attack him and he didn't have a police or a deal with the police.</v>

520
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:22.601
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

521
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:22.631
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

522
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 2>he</v>

523
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 1>doesn't call nine one one because you figure like they wouldn't do anything</v>

524
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

525
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

526
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.523
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's right,</v>

527
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the right way to handle it is going on Twitter and going</v>

528
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:31.700
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

529
00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:32.534
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

530
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's something that someone does when you just want to lash out.</v>

531
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:37.481
<v Speaker 1>And for him,</v>

532
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:38.380
<v Speaker 1>he likes to,</v>

533
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:38.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

534
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>use social media to,</v>

535
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:40.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>to get points across.</v>

537
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.011
<v Speaker 1>And that's a point though.</v>

538
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:46.330
<v Speaker 1>The black on white violence has been a point of interest of his for a long time.</v>

539
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

540
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and there's a reality that exists just like white on black violence exists,</v>

541
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>just like all kinds of violence exists.</v>

542
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And Anthony is a guy who was particularly concerned with that.</v>

543
00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why he carries a gun.</v>

544
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

545
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a rare person that has a concealed carry permit in New York City.</v>

546
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.331
<v Speaker 1>He's one of them.</v>

547
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hard.</v>

548
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's got a big ass fucking blue actually,</v>

549
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.890
<v Speaker 1>so let's check hitting him while he's armed with a deadly weapon and then five</v>

550
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>other people jump in apparently.</v>

551
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing's chaos and I would have loved to for it to be avoided,</v>

552
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:21.011
<v Speaker 1>but I think serious lost the potential opportunity to engage in a discussion</v>

553
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

554
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>about violence in New York City,</v>

555
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 1>about violence in general,</v>

556
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>the people interacting with each other about interacting on social media,</v>

557
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 1>interacting when you're hot with fucking rage and you're just venting and</v>

558
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>ranting and consequently continental and what is your actual intent and and what</v>

559
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 1>is my job as a representative of your Sirius Xm?</v>

560
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Am I am allowed to be Anthony or do I have to be an entity that only thinks like</v>

561
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Sirius XM wants me to think and only tweets like Sirius XM wants me tweet.</v>

562
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 1>When are you clocked off work?</v>

563
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly know and when,</v>

564
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

565
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.363
<v Speaker 1>when are you not,</v>

566
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not supporting him right in this.</v>

567
00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this is,</v>

568
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.450
<v Speaker 1>this is a very tricky situation where the company has to be real careful because</v>

569
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.120
<v Speaker 1>part of what you do is you promote free speech and you,</v>

570
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you have a radio show and you have this network that's uncensored.</v>

571
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.580
<v Speaker 1>There's net was,</v>

572
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.050
<v Speaker 1>it was the coolest thing about Sirius was you could get Howard stern on it and</v>

573
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 1>he could swear it was the greatest thing of all time.</v>

574
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Like from now on,</v>

575
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 1>he's unchained and Opie and Anthony are unchained and comedy is unchained.</v>

576
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.243
<v Speaker 1>You can watch,</v>

577
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you can hear all my bits.</v>

578
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.280
<v Speaker 1>It's totally uncensored.</v>

579
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 1>They have them on Sirius.</v>

580
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

581
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So if all of a sudden you decide that you don't like what a guy says on Twitter,</v>

582
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 1>so his opinions,</v>

583
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>which are very similar that he's voiced on the radio,</v>

584
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.181
<v Speaker 1>very similar,</v>

585
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:45.110
<v Speaker 1>if not identical,</v>

586
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>will now be silenced.</v>

587
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little squirrely.</v>

588
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is a backlash.</v>

589
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a backlash to the,</v>

590
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 1>the racism and or implied racism of his tweets.</v>

591
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

592
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.053
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

593
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.501
<v Speaker 1>did I do,</v>

594
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I wish that he just went on the radio and explained himself and more than 140</v>

595
00:17:01.641 --> 00:17:02.151
<v Speaker 1>characters?</v>

596
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

597
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Cause I bet he could vented the exact same range the next day with no Twitter</v>

598
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.580
<v Speaker 1>thing and people would not have had a problem with it if he said it with his</v>

599
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:11.181
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

600
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:12.530
<v Speaker 1>if he explained what happened,</v>

601
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a real problem with fucking getting out anything super important where</v>

602
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have any mistakes and how you're being perceived with 140</v>

603
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.124
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

604
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

605
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>you're saying cut animal savage,</v>

606
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:25.701
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

607
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:26.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

608
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 1>he's not talking,</v>

609
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>he's writing a bunch of shit down.</v>

610
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So you mad that he's conveying those thoughts.</v>

611
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Do not think that he would have those thoughts of this chick hit him.</v>

612
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you expect them to be,</v>

613
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

615
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>angelic and his approach to violence?</v>

616
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:40.221
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

617
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're looking for here because if it's just that you think</v>

618
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 1>that what he said is racist,</v>

619
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.580
<v Speaker 1>have you ever listened to that show?</v>

620
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Because if you listen to that show,</v>

621
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>he says like that all the time.</v>

622
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I'll say if you have a job as a show host or a pundit,</v>

623
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you really need to be allowed to say what you want on your social media.</v>

624
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.574
<v Speaker 2>Even if it</v>

625
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

626
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

627
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.343
<v Speaker 1>damages or,</v>

628
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.271
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

629
00:17:59.271 --> 00:17:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

630
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.463
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

631
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.221
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>

632
00:18:01.221 --> 00:18:04.310
<v Speaker 1>if he said all Jews need to be thrown into an oven and pissed on while they're</v>

633
00:18:04.311 --> 00:18:05.144
<v Speaker 1>on fire.</v>

634
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

635
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:06.180
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

636
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.710
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

637
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a little bit different.</v>

638
00:18:07.551 --> 00:18:07.691
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

639
00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:07.870
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

640
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>but is it different because where does,</v>

641
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.060
<v Speaker 1>where does one draw the line?</v>

642
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.650
<v Speaker 1>What if he said that and he's only joking?</v>

643
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It turns out he's actually Jewish.</v>

644
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>

645
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know nearly enough about him or the show,</v>

646
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:18.020
<v Speaker 2>so I really don't know.</v>

647
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same thing.</v>

648
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I think when,</v>

649
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.830
<v Speaker 1>when you say something absolutely,</v>

650
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:24.480
<v Speaker 1>totally awful like that,</v>

651
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 1>like all Jews should be like,</v>

652
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you can't be associated with my company.</v>

653
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.321
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

654
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>

655
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not a serious person at that point.</v>

656
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy person.</v>

657
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's a dangerous person too,</v>

658
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 1>because who knows what percentage of the population's listening that's unhinged.</v>

659
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It's been waiting for a guy like you to come along.</v>

660
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't do that,</v>

661
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

662
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

663
00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:47.511
<v Speaker 1>he did his respond to a person who attacked him and then talk in very,</v>

664
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

665
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>racial terms about the scenario.</v>

666
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And he has in the past on the radio show about what it's like to,</v>

667
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:55.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

668
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 1>worry about black violence on white people.</v>

669
00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.401
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

671
00:18:59.401 --> 00:18:59.731
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

672
00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 2>what is that like the young Turks,</v>

673
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

674
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.061
<v Speaker 2>thing you saw,</v>

675
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw that or not,</v>

676
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:04.850
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>

677
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.581
<v Speaker 2>they called them a racist.</v>

678
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the worst things I've ever seen.</v>

679
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.323
<v Speaker 2>I lost,</v>

680
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.163
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

681
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.310
<v Speaker 2>All respect for them just based off of that one interview because it was</v>

682
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.600
<v Speaker 2>completely,</v>

683
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.810
<v Speaker 2>you can know that they don't know the back story.</v>

684
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 2>They don't know.</v>

685
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't listen to the show.</v>

686
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.330
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting thing though,</v>

687
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:21.721
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

688
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.051
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>

689
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at someone who doesn't know,</v>

690
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:24.151
<v Speaker 1>Anthony,</v>

691
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:24.870
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know the show,</v>

692
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.310
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know the backstory and is responding to just deciding everything right</v>

693
00:19:29.311 --> 00:19:29.731
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

694
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:29.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

695
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that he was perving and he's taking a picture of this woman coming up the street</v>

696
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.780
<v Speaker 1>and not knowing about all those other pictures that he had taken and that he is</v>

697
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:37.740
<v Speaker 1>an amateur photographer.</v>

698
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 1>He loves taking pictures in a candid photo of a woman walking down the street.</v>

699
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 1>She's pretty and she had long legs and just said,</v>

700
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>nice body look good.</v>

701
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:44.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

702
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I've heard three in the morning dressed up like street,</v>

703
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

704
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.263
<v Speaker 2>Street meat,</v>

705
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.143
<v Speaker 2>dairy,</v>

706
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:49.610
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

707
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 2>but they jumped on him unfairly and that's like,</v>

708
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.330
<v Speaker 2>that was like Fox News.</v>

709
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.841
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

710
00:19:53.841 --> 00:19:54.080
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

711
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.000
<v Speaker 2>aren't you supposed to be the opposite of this?</v>

712
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

713
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was like Fox News.</v>

714
00:19:57.841 --> 00:20:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like they perceived what his word.</v>

715
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you there's a fucking real problem with saying something like that</v>

716
00:20:05.131 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 1>at 140 characters.</v>

717
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

718
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I've said some dumb shit on Twitter before.</v>

719
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I've had people write full blogs on like one tweet that I had that it was like a</v>

720
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:15.640
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

721
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 1>just a joke tweet.</v>

722
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.143
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

723
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

724
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You could decide that,</v>

725
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you know you have a green light to write something.</v>

726
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 1>It's 140 characters,</v>

727
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>

728
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work for anything important.</v>

729
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:32.700
<v Speaker 1>If you really had a situation where you thought your life was in danger or you</v>

730
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 1>thought you were,</v>

731
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to go unconscious or you're gonna lose your eyesight,</v>

732
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 1>like apparently had like spots on his eyes,</v>

733
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you want to hear that?</v>

734
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Like the full version of it?</v>

735
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 1>I think if Anthony just would tell the full version of it on the air and avoid</v>

736
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 1>the tweets,</v>

737
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>none of this would've happened so he wouldn't be able to express himself the</v>

738
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 1>exact same way.</v>

739
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 1>That fucking cunt animal he have been able to say whatever he wanted.</v>

740
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 1>He would have been able to talk in depth about black on white violence,</v>

741
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not saying that's all that exists.</v>

742
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of white on black violence.</v>

743
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:06.514
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty.</v>

744
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that it exists.</v>

745
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean to pretend it doesn't exist,</v>

746
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.590
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty silly to me to pretend there's not black people that will hit white</v>

747
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>people and robbed them.</v>

748
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Just like to pretend it's not white people who will hit black people and robbed</v>

749
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

750
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Of course it exists.</v>

751
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

752
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Racism exists.</v>

753
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Violent racism from random people on both sides can end,</v>

754
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 1>does exist.</v>

755
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:32.850
<v Speaker 1>So is he right in saying that it exists from them or what do you have to qualify</v>

756
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>it first by saying that there's a lot of piece of shit white people out there as</v>

757
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

758
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

759
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:37.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

760
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:38.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

761
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but in my opinion with what they're doing is silly.</v>

762
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.020
<v Speaker 1>This is a quote from Penn Jillette today.</v>

763
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Penn says this.</v>

764
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>If I'm in a position where I cross somebody who was carrying a gun and can,</v>

765
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 1>can defend themselves and hurt me,</v>

766
00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 1>and their choice is to write angry stuff on Twitter instead of fighting me back.</v>

767
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:55.901
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

768
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi.</v>

769
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.580
<v Speaker 1>That's Gandy.</v>

770
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:57.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

771
00:21:57.971 --> 00:21:58.804
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>

772
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I think just cause you have a gun that doesn't make you any more special,</v>

773
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:03.191
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

774
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:03.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

775
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use my gun.</v>

776
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:04.751
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

777
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:06.320
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't even be on the table in the first place.</v>

778
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It certainly should be on the table.</v>

779
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 1>If someone's trying to take your life.</v>

780
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between someone punishing you with her knuckles and</v>

781
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:13.060
<v Speaker 1>someone beating you to death?</v>

782
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

783
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.030
<v Speaker 1>however much of a background do you have in violence?</v>

784
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen someone get knocked unconscious in a street fight?</v>

785
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.743
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

786
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.501
<v Speaker 1>actually yeah,</v>

787
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:25.501
<v Speaker 1>but on Youtube I've seen in real life I've seen in real life a few times and</v>

788
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying.</v>

789
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I saw in real life once in Hollywood,</v>

790
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.090
<v Speaker 1>there was a a moment in front of the comedy store,</v>

791
00:22:31.091 --> 00:22:31.930
<v Speaker 1>we're all hanging out.</v>

792
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It was after a show and this guy and this other guy got in this argument and</v>

793
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 1>there was traffic going by and they're right in front of the House of Blues,</v>

794
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 1>which is directly across the street from the comedy store.</v>

795
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of this argument there's back and forth and it's a white guy</v>

796
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:52.000
<v Speaker 1>and a black guy and you see them start to like swinging at each other and the</v>

797
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 1>white guy goes into a full panic.</v>

798
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.850
<v Speaker 1>All I remember is this guy like standing like wincing his eyes and flailing with</v>

799
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 1>his hands like literally had it would just in full panic and this black eyes,</v>

800
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I see him hit him and I see cars go in front of it and I don't know what</v>

801
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

802
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:11.441
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

803
00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I know that they're,</v>

804
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Speaker 1>they're hitting each other because the white guy was flailing,</v>

805
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see the connection.</v>

806
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the car goes back,</v>

807
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 1>the car passes and the guys flat out cold on the concrete just in serious</v>

809
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

810
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>He's in the street.</v>

811
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 1>There's cars going by.</v>

812
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>He's in a fight with a guy and he's completely unconscious and everybody's</v>

813
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:30.041
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

814
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 1>There's cars honking this guys out cold on the street.</v>

815
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.230
<v Speaker 1>That guy could die easy.</v>

816
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.041
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

817
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:37.800
<v Speaker 1>we tell you something that a woman can do that too.</v>

818
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 1>You just like a man can do that to you.</v>

819
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that there's women out there that can punch you in the face</v>

820
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and knock you unconscious because you never been punched by a,</v>

821
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of women that can punch really fucking hard.</v>

822
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:48.920

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

846
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>So should you applaud him for night pulling out his gun?</v>

847
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

848
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

849
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't pull out a gun in that situation.</v>

850
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And he did the right thing so that I agree with them.</v>

851
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:30.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

852
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I just wouldn't go as far as saying that he is a Gandhi.</v>

853
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.723
<v Speaker 3>Like that's I,</v>

00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Even you the regular person.</v>

862
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

863
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.680
<v Speaker 3>of course it's going to get closed.</v>

864
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.830
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to tell sarcasm.</v>

865
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

866
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.770
<v Speaker 3>I've thought that he was serious because he's a pretty serious guy.</v>

867
00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Guy Realized that.</v>

868
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.150
<v Speaker 3>He realized he does a show in Vegas and shit,</v>

869
00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:53.230
<v Speaker 3>but he's very serious.</v>

870
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 3>A lot of serious ideas.</v>

871
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.363
<v Speaker 3>He's serious.</v>

872
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:55.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

873
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:57.900
<v Speaker 3>he's joking about that by saying he's gone.</v>

874
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.530
<v Speaker 3>He's premise.</v>

875
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:00.140
<v Speaker 3>The series,</v>

876
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.400
<v Speaker 3>the premise is absolutely serious.</v>

877
00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

878
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 3>Is there any way to see a security video of how this went down?</v>

879
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.983
<v Speaker 3>Good question.</v>

880
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Good question.</v>

881
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Given how serious is a big company,</v>

882
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a big implications to drop one of your biggest host so well.</v>

883
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Their outrage was all over online.</v>

884
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.020
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

885
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 3>People went crazy about it.</v>

886
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.031
<v Speaker 3>Here's going crazy.</v>

887
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 3>There's petitions right now.</v>

888
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:18.891
<v Speaker 3>They're up to like,</v>

889
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I think last I saw it was 15,000 you know there's the cancer once canceling it.</v>

890
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 3>They have to be getting hurt by this because honestly Howard stern and opie and</v>

891
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:27.831
<v Speaker 3>Anthony,</v>

892
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much,</v>

893
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:30.930
<v Speaker 3>fueling that channel.</v>

895
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

896
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

897
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.081
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

898
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:35.120
<v Speaker 3>For sure because I don't know what they make their money off.</v>

899
00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:35.841
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

900
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 3>I would just be guessing.</v>

901
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

902
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that opie and Anthony has definitely a huge pie.</v>

903
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 3>What's a great Chai</v>

904
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.100
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

905
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a great show and by the way,</v>

906
00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:47.470
<v Speaker 1>if it was on the Internet it would still be awesome if they just switched to the</v>

907
00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

908
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.551
<v Speaker 1>It'd be huge.</v>

909
00:25:48.551 --> 00:25:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be a great opportunity for them if they meet,</v>

910
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.200
<v Speaker 1>they cancel Anthony if they fire Anthony,</v>

911
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:54.010
<v Speaker 1>just hope he's still under</v>

912
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.840
<v Speaker 3>contract mean how's that work there?</v>

913
00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.610
<v Speaker 3>What Ob said today is that him and Jim will be back on Monday next Monday.</v>

914
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Well I said they might have,</v>

915
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.830
<v Speaker 3>they might be making it the opn Jim show just based on contracts,</v>

916
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but what's interesting is is leading up to this is how much [inaudible] has been</v>

917
00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:11.620
<v Speaker 3>talking about that he's done.</v>

918
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.060
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to sign a contract.</v>

919
00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:13.570
<v Speaker 3>He does.</v>

920
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.590
<v Speaker 3>He wants to do a podcast.</v>

921
00:26:14.591 --> 00:26:19.591
<v Speaker 3>He's done and this whole timing of this is very interesting because sometimes</v>

922
00:26:20.531 --> 00:26:21.364
<v Speaker 3>that's how the university,</v>

923
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

924
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting.</v>

925
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.093
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

926
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.373
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

927
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

928
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Wonder Man,</v>

929
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I hope they do a podcast.</v>

930
00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:27.811
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

931
00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the show's awesome.</v>

932
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.281
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

933
00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Show to watch little Jimmy.</v>

934
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:32.130
<v Speaker 1>He's the funniest guy ever on radio.</v>

935
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Jim Norton is my favorite guy ever of all time on radio.</v>

936
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.210
<v Speaker 1>No question about it.</v>

937
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Consistently comes with the funny,</v>

938
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.080
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious and he's smart.</v>

939
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:41.880
<v Speaker 1>He's well thought out.</v>

940
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.271
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

941
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting,</v>

942
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.101
<v Speaker 1>he's honest.</v>

943
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I really love Joey.</v>

944
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a hilarious comedian too.</v>

945
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.933
<v Speaker 1>He's so fun.</v>

946
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Plus he makes me feel,</v>

947
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like it's so much of a per,</v>

948
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:51.624
<v Speaker 1>after I hang out with him,</v>

949
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 1>like I thought my act at too many Dick Jokes.</v>

950
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Then I went to see him and I even told them that I go,</v>

951
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

952
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I had the best time that you freed me in a lot of ways because sometimes I go,</v>

953
00:26:59.671 --> 00:26:59.851
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

954
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I got so many Dick Jokes.</v>

955
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Why keep writing Dick Jokes?</v>

956
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.860
<v Speaker 1>His whole act was dick jokes from beginning to end.</v>

957
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And I loved it.</v>

958
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

959
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I saw him at a cobb's Cobb's comedy club in the Austin,</v>

960
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.190
<v Speaker 1>not cops.</v>

961
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

962
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

963
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.820
<v Speaker 1>cap city kept city Comedy Club in Austin.</v>

964
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Anthony's starting as a compound show this week though.</v>

965
00:27:18.731 --> 00:27:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So that's going to be interesting because I don't know how if he has a lawyer,</v>

966
00:27:21.821 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 2>if he said he,</v>

967
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know he was going to lawyer up if,</v>

968
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.670
<v Speaker 2>but what if he can talk about and what he can't talk about.</v>

969
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 2>You know it's going to be interesting.</v>

970
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm pretty sure he could probably talk about the incident that he could</v>

971
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:33.890
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

972
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 1>No one can keep you from talking about a person attacking you.</v>

973
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>How could they keep you from doing that?</v>

974
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Any person that could keep you from doing that is not a person want to be</v>

975
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:42.600
<v Speaker 1>associated with it.</v>

976
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 1>They fire you for that.</v>

977
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:44.334
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

978
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Imagine someone keeping you from talking about you being attacked,</v>

979
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 1>like your own personal experience.</v>

980
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Speaker 1>How he expresses himself is entirely up to him.</v>

981
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll probably get a more balanced view of it now than when it happened.</v>

982
00:27:59.370 --> 00:27:59.701
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

983
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably going to take into consideration all the,</v>

984
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the heat and the bullshit and the time that's elapsed and the motions that have</v>

985
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and the tension that's relaxed,</v>

986
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 1>the sting of the punches and he'll be able to look at it and give you a funny</v>

987
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 1>assessment of it.</v>

988
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.770
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

989
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 1>the show would just be better if they go on the Internet.</v>

990
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 1>They can do whatever they want a hundred times.</v>

991
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't need anybody anymore.</v>

992
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I can move.</v>

993
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.373
<v Speaker 1>You just don't it.</v>

994
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

995
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 1>They can move anywhere they want.</v>

996
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't need anybody anymore.</v>

997
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:28.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

998
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.463
<v Speaker 1>it's silly.</v>

999
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like the amount of people that don't have iPods or iPhones or can't get</v>

1000
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 1>their phone to stream through their radio.</v>

1001
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It's common almost everybody now it's really close,</v>

1002
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1003
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:41.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1004
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.480
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're commuting,</v>

1005
00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:44.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting on subways and shit like that,</v>

1006
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually better than having some sort of a satellite that sends it to</v>

1007
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you and you can get it whenever you want.</v>

1008
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You can pause it.</v>

1009
00:28:51.601 --> 00:28:52.890
<v Speaker 1>You can listen whenever you want.</v>

1010
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just a better medium,</v>

1011
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.381
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1012
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:56.191
<v Speaker 1>And that don't me wrong.</v>

1013
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I have three cars that have a Sirius satellite radio.</v>

1014
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:00.354
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1015
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1016
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that I could flip through the,</v>

1017
00:29:03.281 --> 00:29:04.800
<v Speaker 1>the shit and listen to new music.</v>

1018
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I love that I can,</v>

1019
00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1020
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 1>get on the classic Vinyl Station and listened to all classic rock.</v>

1021
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm old as fuck.</v>

1022
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm old as fuck.</v>

1023
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:12.834
<v Speaker 1>And I reminisce.</v>

1024
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I listen to some Bob Seger.</v>

1025

<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

1026
00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:17.521
<v Speaker 1>I like serious.</v>

1027
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep it as a product.</v>

1028
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.321
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1029
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you've got to realize what you're selling.</v>

1030
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.950
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1031
