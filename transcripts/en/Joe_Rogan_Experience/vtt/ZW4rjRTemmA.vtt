<v Speaker 1>Cause I grew up with like with like finding a playboy magazine and then just</v>

7
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>batting off to it until I found another magazine that was,</v>

8
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9

<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

13
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Australian guys find the magazines in the woods.</v>

14
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:26.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that incredible?</v>

20
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And I always used to think that some adults hidden it.</v>

21
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>He probably looked back at it and I just,</v>

22
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>some other kid hit it there and the board and the simulation,</v>

23
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>it was programmed now.</v>

24
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he grew there.</v>

26
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to find it.</v>

27
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I have to that environment.</v>

28
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I remember and I can show you young.</v>

29
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I was about seven years old,</v>

30
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>seven and I found this picture.</v>

31
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

32
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>my mother was the only woman in the house.</v>

33
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I went through one of her magazines.</v>

34
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't have underwear catalog sitting around like a Victoria secret</v>

35
00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>catalog or something like that would have been good.</v>

36
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>But I found this picture in my moms' Women's magazine,</v>

37
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>it was just this naked ticket and these magazine never had a naked Titone it</v>

38
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:01.631
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

39
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

40
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>So I cut this picture,</v>

41
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>this picture I masturbated to this picture from about seven till ten one this</v>

42
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.773
<v Speaker 1>one tick.</v>

43
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

44
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And I found out at 10 cause I was watching the news,</v>

45
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>it was a picture of a woman having a mammogram.</v>

46
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

47
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't know as a kid and I used to think cause the other tick was in a</v>

49
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>machine being squeezed down.</v>

50
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.773
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

51
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like that must be some sex machine.</v>

52
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.591
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

53
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>That kept your interest for so long.</v>

54
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I still did the lingerie thing out of the Sears catalog from my friends,</v>

55
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>my mom's Sears catalog and I used to keep it and I put it in mind like books and</v>

56
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>like Heidi in a book and like pull it out and look at it and masturbate and</v>

57
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

58
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I being the laundry,</v>

59
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>you know like in the catalogs.</v>

60
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:47.501
<v Speaker 1>The old catalogs.</v>

61
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>We used to have catalogs.</v>

62
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I remember there being,</v>

63
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>I used to bike one of video and then when I went to university and I was like 22</v>

64
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

65
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>they used to keep on sending me the catalogs because I bought a couple of videos</v>

67
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I used to keep them and they was just,</v>

68
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>they were just like little pictures of scenes from the movie though.</v>

69
00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I tried it,</v>

70
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I never bought anything but the catalogs once a month.</v>

71
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That was a big diet free and I was broke,</v>

72
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking happy I have that.</v>

74
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I always used to keep my room mate one catalog behind so he would get the new</v>

75
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>months one after I got my new money.</v>

76
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It's funny that what you would want then to see naked girls to look at it and</v>

77
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>girls that people would deny that of you.</v>

78
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>They say you're not ready for that yet.</v>

79
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what it's all about.</v>

80
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 2>It's about protecting kids.</v>

81
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 2>But clearly you have these sexual crazy urges and everyone's just in denial</v>

82
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:39.031
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

83
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:39.631

86
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:46.831
<v Speaker 2>a little tinny.</v>

87
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't even need to see a vagina.</v>

88
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Can I just see a lag?</v>

89
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.910

125
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>So when we were kids,</v>

126
00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:48.950
<v Speaker 1>if me and my two brothers were sitting watching,</v>

127
00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:50.120
<v Speaker 1>let's say the movie labyrinth,</v>

128
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.130
<v Speaker 1>we all watching like a very innocent puppet related film all at once during the</v>

129
00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:55.461
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>

130
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:56.211
<v Speaker 1>he'd be alone in the house.</v>

131
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>We'd all go,</v>

132
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.863

<v Speaker 1>Within seconds,</v>

136
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>my dad would just casually walk out and sit and watch the rest of the film with</v>

137
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.711
<v Speaker 1>John and go,</v>

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.913
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

141
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>go all the way through the film and then you go,</v>

142
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.993
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

143
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.270

144
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I missed what happened in the beginning.</v>

145
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Trolled him.</v>

00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:27.810
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

150
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you let him sit through the whole movie.</v>

151
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

152
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 1>we don't go off and play.</v>

153
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd have to sit through the first 30 minutes again.</v>

154
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

159
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.244
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

160
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.660
<v Speaker 1>You guys should've filmed that.</v>

161
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>That would make a whole area short film this,</v>

162
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>explain it and have them near the time code.</v>

163
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:48.690

<v Speaker 1>You should do this.</v>

165
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I could see it.</v>

166
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I get why it's filmed.</v>

167
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>The light of the TV is what's on him.</v>

168
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:55.291
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

169
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Little time code in the bottom.</v>

170
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Show him 10 years later,</v>

171
00:04:58.771 --> 00:04:59.820
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes later,</v>

172
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes later.</v>

175
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>areas they could be hilarious if you explain it to the camera.</v>

176
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>He found some porn magazines or they were retained in this,</v>

177
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>but he found some porn magazines under,</v>

178
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>my mother found a porn magazines under my bed and she put them in the bean cause</v>

179
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.480

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you know you put them in the Bin and then she didn't say anything to me.</v>

182

184
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>so I felt like I got away with it.</v>

185
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>But my porn draw was empty.</v>

186
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

187
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And I worked in news agency,</v>

188
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 1>so I used to collect them from the bins out the back of the news agency.</v>

189
00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So I had piles and piles of them.</v>

190
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I was a paper boy.</v>

191
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

192

195
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I look onto the bench and there's all my porn magazines.</v>

196
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>They're all dogeared and they're like lettuce leaf on them and stuff because</v>
