50
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.863
<v Speaker 1>is all the cops left their dorms to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this show and they went back and </v>

51
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.054
<v Speaker 1>then they told the inmates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I go to yard the next day the </v>

52
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>inmates were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dog,</v>

58
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>that's like against the code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cops would be like,</v>

59
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:29.154
<v Speaker 1>all right everybody give them an item </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can go in there and perform an </v>

60
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>item.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An item is like a soup,</v>

61
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>a hot chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people are paid to show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You could be a comedian.</v>

89
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of whether or not you</v>

90
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>get these people to allow you inside </v>

<v Speaker 1>stand up comedy is kind of like music </v>

104
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I'm in a program called sap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's substance abuse program and I'm </v>

108

<v Speaker 1>halftime if you take this program.</v>

109
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So the wardens like,</v>

135
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.843
<v Speaker 1>appreciating something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just take for granted because you </v>

136
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.634
<v Speaker 1>can get it anytime you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're so restricted you get </v>

137
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:02.680
<v Speaker 1>those things and it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like there's guys I still talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like friends and it was,</v>

143
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.560

<v Speaker 1>How was prison?</v>

144
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:19.394
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like when people say that </v>

145
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>about war to men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.143
<v Speaker 1>people say that about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings need a certain </v>

147
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:26.714
<v Speaker 1>amount of struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you experienced that </v>

148
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>struggle than the non struggle feel so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

149
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

150
00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>there's moments where I've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this before,</v>

151
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.854
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm a hunting in Alaska on this </v>

152
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince of Wales and it rained every day.</v>

153
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>We were there for six days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pouring rain,</v>

154
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.060
<v Speaker 1>drenched haver hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst,</v>

156
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.233
<v Speaker 1>like as far as like getting wet and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>being soaked and cold all the time to </v>

157
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst experiences you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever go through because you're just,</v>

158
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it's always like 45,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 degrees pouring rain and you know,</v>

159
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping bags with the inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your tents.</v>

160
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's wet.</v>

161
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>But when I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was sunny out and I called</v>

162
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:12.690
<v Speaker 1>my friend Steve Rinella who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>took me with him on this trip I go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been happier in my life.</v>

164
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.383
<v Speaker 1>Like the sun is shining like what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally just totally take for granted </v>

165
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 1>exact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

166
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

167
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driving on the street.</v>

168
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think I've ever been happier,</v>

169
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>but I was that happy because I had gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the struggle.</v>

170
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>But nobody wants to do that on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

171
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:32.924
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're kind of forced into a </v>

172
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine like being in prison.</v>

173
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Then when you get that Kentucky Fried </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken and you get that soda,</v>

174
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

175
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking living it up right now.</v>

176
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

177
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I came from a place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this thing,</v>

178
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>it's called a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what it's called,</v>

179
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:50.174
<v Speaker 1>but you have money in your books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has money and they do like a </v>

180
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.603
<v Speaker 1>sell off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll go to the local vons by the </v>

181
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>prison and they'll buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can buy sodas,</v>

182
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pizza.</v>

183
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>But nobody ever had Kentucky Fried </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicken in that bitch.</v>

184
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Like to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like my.</v>

185
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I want to put that in my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my.</v>

186
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Like my bio had Kentucky Fried Chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>in prison.</v>
