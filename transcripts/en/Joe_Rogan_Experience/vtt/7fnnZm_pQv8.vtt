<v Speaker 1>but I wish they would release it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>web.</v>

20
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>The ravine comer.</v>

21
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:08.211
<v Speaker 1>The footage is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some concern that the </v>

22
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:11.901
<v Speaker 1>hunt and folk would abandon us all </v>
<v Speaker 1>because French rapists folk don't like </v>

23
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>these Goddamn comedians coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gang up are fine.</v>

24
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>American pastime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting folk,</v>

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>some of the hunting folk look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most hunting people are like most </v>

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are cool as fuck.</v>

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I maintain this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe this.</v>

28
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe that most people are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very small percentage of people.</v>

29
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long ass time to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>

30
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Just the sheer numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that when something goes </v>

31
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.761
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so disturbing for us that we get </v>

32
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.281
<v Speaker 1>upset and we lump all other folks into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same category that that person came </v>

33
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:54.441
<v Speaker 1>from almost to protect ourselves and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it's a prejudice and like having a </v>

34
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:59.240
<v Speaker 1>prejudice towards people who live in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>south or having a prejudice towards </v>

35
00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

36
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any kind of prejudice like it's not </v>

37
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.261
<v Speaker 1>going to spend another 10 team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their fans is not a nicer prejudice </v>

38
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>because they just have a southern accent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they lived down there and you just </v>

39
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>think it's cute to think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>retarded.</v>

40
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Goddamn prejudice.</v>

41
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Those are people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>If you thought they were tardy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were black,</v>

43
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>you'd be as a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

44
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can think that they're retarded </v>

45
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.501
<v Speaker 1>just because they talk like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some of them that talk like this </v>

46
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>are actually super intelligent people as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they choose to keep their accent.</v>

47
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken to professors that are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a strong Houston,</v>

48
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Texas accent and guy was genius as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are tribal.</v>

50
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>People are just trial and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to do that.</v>

51
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Those guys over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like people from West Virginia </v>

52
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

53

<v Speaker 1>talking hunting and that's not what </v>

55
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>hunting is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What hunting is about is how I do it.</v>

56
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I get up in the morning and I faced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>east and it was that Muslims.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like fashion American boys.</v>

72
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the term so you can find with </v>

73
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.830

<v Speaker 1>Not just like on podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like as move.</v>

84
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>If it was a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be one of the best things that </v>

85
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>it was a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be one of the best things I you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have never.</v>

96
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:24.451
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to great professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anybody kind of break </v>

97
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>down the history as a story where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't wait for the next podcast and</v>

98
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:31.981
<v Speaker 1>then radio lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've always listened to npr and </v>

99
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they have those on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but radiolab is pretty amazing.</v>

100
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

101
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is cleaned skinned.</v>

102
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.690
<v Speaker 1>A clean skin terrorist is a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacker with a spotless record whose </v>

103
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>documents don't arouse suspicion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

104
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Well you gotta think like every </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist,</v>

105
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:52.231
<v Speaker 1>every dude who blows a fuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be like there's a moment </v>

106
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>where you could get to a certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be like pretty nutty and get to </v>

107
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>a certain age without a criminal record </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you all the time.</v>

108
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>You're like building up for the one big </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty event.</v>

109
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Those are the scary guys that inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>live inside and then they're just </v>

110
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>waiting for action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're terrified and they just.</v>

112
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 1>They're fantasizing that going over in </v>
<v Speaker 1>her head,</v>

113
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>going over their head and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally explode.</v>

114
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Now how did those guys get made?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that nature and nurture?</v>

115
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the ultimate question?</v>

116
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Because if we could stop all people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would wantonly want to create war for </v>

117
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:31.141
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we could stop all people that would </v>

118
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 1>act in the name of global aggression for</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial gain.</v>

119
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:38.851
<v Speaker 1>If we can stop all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would all do it and then we'd have a </v>

120
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:41.581
<v Speaker 1>way crazier world if we had a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody was basically really </v>

121
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

123
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:48.001
<v Speaker 1>although you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're suggesting in the way you framed </v>

124
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:50.511
<v Speaker 1>that as you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're assuming that people that are </v>

125
00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:55.261
<v Speaker 1>aggressive or create aggression or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the aggressors are doing it only </v>

126
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:59.701
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think this only for </v>

127
00:05:59.701 --> 00:05:59.701
<v Speaker 1>certain</v>

128
00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:03.190
<v Speaker 2>negative things like a money conquest </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory that the problem is that </v>

129
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times can be fostered in groups</v>

130
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:11.741
<v Speaker 2>of people if they think that another </v>
<v Speaker 2>country is actually going to hurt them </v>

131
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:16.571
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be very much useful in a self </v>

132
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>defense capacity or at least justified </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way and always has been.</v>

133
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think you'll ever get.</v>

134
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you'll ever get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression and you probably shouldn't.</v>

135
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's part of the order of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe I bought.</v>

136
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 2>What I think you have to do is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest threat is,</v>

137
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that's always kind of </v>

138
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>confounding about life is that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long to build something.</v>

139
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 2>It takes so long to build a complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>

140
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.520
<v Speaker 2>It takes so long to build something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sistine Chapel and it's so easy to </v>

141
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 2>destroy one motivated fanatic with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>a large enough bomb on his back.</v>

143
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 2>He could blow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 2>St Peter's Cathedral or could kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people.</v>

145
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's so hard is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that take so long to build are so</v>

146
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:04.540
<v Speaker 2>easy to destroy and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as technology grows it,</v>

147
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.660
<v Speaker 2>it's going to become more and more a </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor in more and more of a reality </v>

148
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.451
<v Speaker 2>where one person or a small group can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get their hands on devastating </v>

149
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 2>technology to destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 2>something impossibly huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the bigger question.</v>

151
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I think aggression is always going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

152
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>And when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:26.951
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how those people are made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it's going to be done </v>

154
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:29.471
<v Speaker 2>by that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy because one crazy can't get his </v>

155
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:32.021
<v Speaker 2>hands on massive amounts of weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's usually one guy and he carries a </v>

156
00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 2>gun and he does enough damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

157
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 2>how about these kids in the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombings?</v>

158
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were fairly clean skinned.</v>

159
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 2>They were and they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they,</v>

160
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 2>they killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think six people.</v>

161
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I can remember what the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's always tragic.</v>

162
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.020
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger threat is less aggression and</v>

163
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:55.031
<v Speaker 2>more sort of warped ideology then moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and motivates a large group of people </v>

164
00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:55.750
<v Speaker 2>into aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

165
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>That that's what I worry about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think,</v>

166
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say aggression,</v>

167
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:05.231
<v Speaker 2>you don't mean aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hostile takeover of countries type </v>

168
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 2>of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean just like male behavior?</v>

169
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean when you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression?</v>

170
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Aggression in this context is a military</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

171
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Something that causes massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>

172
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.360
<v Speaker 2>irreparable harm to infrastructure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>two populations and for example,</v>

173
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in Iraq with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with Isis,</v>

174
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you hear the news,</v>

175
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>if you just listen to the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis is this terrible group of fanatics.</v>

176
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes they are and they kill lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

177
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a much deeper problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

178
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about what do you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>about isis?</v>

179
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you bomb the shit out of him?</v>

180
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Problem is they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're ingrained in the Sunni towns and</v>

181
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>population and they have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>support by the Sunni's.</v>

182
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do these fanatical guys have support</v>

183
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:51.101
<v Speaker 2>from the Sunni population?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has nothing to do with whether those </v>

184
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Sunni people who are good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just said,</v>

185
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 2>most people are really good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

186
00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.110
<v Speaker 2>They are giving support to a fanatical </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people because they are their </v>

187
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.101
<v Speaker 2>best hedge and their best bet against </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called Shia aggression in their </v>

188
00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Shia,</v>

189
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 2>the Shia who dominate the south of Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who sit on most of the oil down there.</v>

190
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.270
<v Speaker 2>If the Sunni's don't cut out a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>place for themselves using this crazy </v>

191
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.951
<v Speaker 2>group called Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could be left in there in the </v>

192
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in real fucking trouble.</v>

193
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.790
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're talking about they're using </v>

194
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 2>aggression as a form in their eyes as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of self defense.</v>

195
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 2>If you are a Sunni Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a very different idea and </v>

196
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.360
<v Speaker 2>context of what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Isis is as as opposed to uni who </v>

197
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 2>get our information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

198
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing to admire about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

199
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 2>They are ruthless killers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just interesting that you and I</v>

200
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:44.140
<v Speaker 2>look at that as aggression on a ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

201
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>one side is a lot of those people using </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice as his health defense.</v>

202
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Aggression is justified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

203
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 2>they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we need them against the Shia.</v>

204
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard for someone who lives in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California in 2015 to wrap their head </v>

205
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 2>around what's going on in other parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world right now,</v>

206
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 2>unless you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even what I've seen of it,</v>

207
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

208
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my seeing of it as all two dimensional.</v>

209
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine I couldn't fucking </v>

210
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 2>mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the biggest problems we were</v>

211
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 2>going to have with people that have seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and don't have to imagine it anymore.</v>

212
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Trying to forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to be normal again.</v>

213
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>When you ask a fucking hell of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and,</v>

214
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 2>and how do you help them through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what kind of counseling?</v>

215
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Mental health counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's comprehensive.</v>

216
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good question because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>always say after a war and after the </v>

217
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>revolution and after whatever happens in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a country settles,</v>

218
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 2>everybody always forgets about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victims.</v>

219
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.180
<v Speaker 2>There's never really any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure to help people in Sierra </v>

220
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Leone that got their arms hacked off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other kids killed in front of</v>

221
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:53.481
<v Speaker 2>them and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that because of the </v>

222
00:10:53.481 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 2>ability that we have right now translate</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages so quickly,</v>

223
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just really unprecedented something </v>

224
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.831
<v Speaker 2>that people don't think about that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's all sorts of software now </v>

225
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 2>just on a regular phone that can look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>images and translate them into English </v>

226
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 2>on your screen.</v>

227
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 2>The you could have asked questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have those questions immediately </v>

228
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 2>translated into Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all these programs they have now</v>

229
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>like it's way easier to understand under</v>
<v Speaker 2>other languages than it ever has been </v>

230
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.151
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To decipher actual texts in real time </v>

231
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:29.990
<v Speaker 2>that really never existed before and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of technology is going to </v>

232
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.251
<v Speaker 2>slowly but surely break down a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers and a lot of ideas that we have</v>

233
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 2>about each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

234
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So language and I think more so the fact</v>

235
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 2>that we can not only see suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 2>realtime with cameras and the Internet,</v>

236
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.700
<v Speaker 2>but we can also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are also starting to see the </v>

237
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.231
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're Indian or South Korea </v>

238
00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>are really similar to Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:51.850
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

240
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 2>with K pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Korea has got all their k pop and</v>

241
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>

242
00:11:55.481 --> 00:12:00.481
<v Speaker 2>when you see their artistic expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making movie slumdog </v>

243
00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:00.481
<v Speaker 2>millionaire.</v>

244
00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 2>You see an Indian kid who has the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams and aspirations as anybody does.</v>

245
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that goes a longer way in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing people into sort of a </v>

246
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.661
<v Speaker 2>collective notion and it already has </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like Steven pinker would argue </v>

247
00:12:12.661 --> 00:12:16.770
<v Speaker 2>that that it's becoming easier to </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify with other people's suffering </v>

248
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:23.941
<v Speaker 2>because we identify with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of how they live their lives to </v>

249
00:12:23.941 --> 00:12:28.681
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer like who are those </v>

250
00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 2>strange people with dark skin nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

251
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 2>people are dressing the same no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you go,</v>

252
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I kind of recognized on the plane </v>

253
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.230
<v Speaker 2>from a woman from Bombay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Mumbai because she watches how I </v>

254
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.981
<v Speaker 2>met your mother and telling me all her </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends love how I met your mother and </v>

255
00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:48.181
<v Speaker 2>she was flipping out that the guy from </v>
<v Speaker 2>how I met your mother was sitting next </v>

256
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 2>to her and she had a heavy accent.</v>

257
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 2>She was talking like I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm watching all my </v>

258
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

259
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I take a big step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was so excited and she had this </v>

260
00:12:59.260 --> 00:12:59.480
<v Speaker 2>heavy Indian accent and I thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

261
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 2>that never would have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

262
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 2>you never would have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we are sharing artistic </v>

263
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.531
<v Speaker 2>experience was sharing experience in </v>
<v Speaker 2>high relief usually in movies and TV.</v>

264
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's in a lot of ways that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go a lot farther than being able to </v>

265
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 2>download a language because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always going to take more time.</v>

266
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we all just spoke the same language,</v>

267
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 2>it will be really fucking boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

268
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.500
<v Speaker 2>But it would be really cool if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood what the fuck everybody was </v>

269
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.970
<v Speaker 2>saying all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

270
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it would smooth out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit between people.</v>

271
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.530
<v Speaker 2>I really got to think that like if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have like real time conversations </v>

272
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.270
<v Speaker 2>with like Kim Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uhm,</v>

273
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could have a real time </v>

274
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.440
<v Speaker 2>conversation with that dude and sit down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

275
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.640
<v Speaker 2>what is your life like?</v>

276
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Like explained to me like what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was childhood like for you?</v>

277
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.430
<v Speaker 2>What's the environment around you all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

278
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.840
<v Speaker 2>He's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real life king and he's like,</v>

279
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.850
<v Speaker 2>he's a monarch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the few remaining is not that he </v>

280
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>lives like a king and it was raised like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prince and Dennis Rodman's,</v>

281
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 2>his homeboy that problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great,</v>

282
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.260
<v Speaker 2>great spokesman for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't he?</v>

283
00:14:06.261 --> 00:14:11.261
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Rodman comes down things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude and plays basketball and shit </v>

284
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:15.871
<v Speaker 2>and then leaves like what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bizarro reality TV world are we </v>

285
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:21.511
<v Speaker 2>living in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Dennis Rodman just hops on private </v>

286
00:14:21.511 --> 00:14:21.900
<v Speaker 2>jets and hangs out with the king of </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>

287
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Be the greatest reality show I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

288
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean him and Kim Jong Un,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and me and me and the Canada.</v>

289
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like rocky Marciano hanging you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mussolini.</v>

290
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 2>What do they talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they talk about?</v>

291
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're together.</v>

292
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Having a good old time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he's freaked out at all </v>

293
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 2>about the middle amount of metal that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Rodman's face?</v>

294
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.490
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freaks them out.</v>

295
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

296
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.720
<v Speaker 2>That is such a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

297
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a king.</v>

298
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he have his own uncle eaten wild </v>

299
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.040
<v Speaker 2>dogs or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

300
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

301
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:54.740
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

302
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 2>He assassinated him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That says,</v>

303
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about a Rodman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodman did that had his uncle killed.</v>

304
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.130
<v Speaker 2>His uncle apparently was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize a coup,</v>

305
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.740
<v Speaker 2>so he killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe he killed everyone in the </v>

306
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in the family except the wife,</v>

307
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:20.110
<v Speaker 2>and he gave the wife like a raise really</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted her to a better position.</v>

308
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Real true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killed her husband.</v>

309
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

310
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>

311
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real game of thrones shit.</v>

312
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

313
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really did kill his uncle and then </v>

314
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.971
<v Speaker 2>his uncle's sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so his uncle's sons couldn't take </v>

315
00:15:36.971 --> 00:15:36.971
<v Speaker 2>revenge on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:15:36.971 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 2>The Russians were good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She used to do that and Stalin,</v>

317
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody needs to do that.</v>

318
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.100
<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was it?</v>

319
00:15:45.101 --> 00:15:46.950
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at helmet shoulder.</v>

320
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 2>One of the ex German premiers went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet.</v>

321
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:50.900
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it.</v>

322
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say hi to the ambassador,</v>

323
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 2>these different D German ambassador who </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known for 10 years,</v>

324
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 2>and they said he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

325
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.110
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

326
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.190
<v Speaker 2>he was executed for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

327
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.670
<v Speaker 2>for treason and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd known him for a long time and it </v>

328
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 2>was really kind of taken aback and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

329
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

330
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.720
<v Speaker 2>that really makes me upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

331
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I see the family?</v>

332
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I got to know the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to give them my condolences to </v>

333
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.440
<v Speaker 2>the family is no longer around either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

334
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.290
<v Speaker 2>he told that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on that.</v>

335
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie rose or something where.</v>

336
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they killed his whole family.</v>

337
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>

338
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

339
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no idea what it's like.</v>

340
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:32.231
<v Speaker 2>We're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're so lucky we can walk away from </v>

341
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:35.411
<v Speaker 2>things we don't like because most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world has to live with something they </v>

342
00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:38.531
<v Speaker 2>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Concluding a government that tells them </v>

343
00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 2>what to do and tells them where to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>until some where they're going.</v>

344
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is propaganda or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

345
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's bullshit or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just telling you what I read,</v>

346
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 2>that they were putting people in jail if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't cry hard enough.</v>

347
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.130
<v Speaker 2>When Kim Jong Il died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

348
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were getting six months of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard labor from what?</v>

349
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not crying hard because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>not grieving hard enough.</v>

350
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:06.131
<v Speaker 2>So you see these pictures that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>beating their chest and crying party </v>

351
00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 2>members crying for know nobody wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

352
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>The first person has stopped crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're crying for hours.</v>

353
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is madness.</v>

354
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 2>That's like group madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that's what North Korea is.</v>

355
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Group madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're watching what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you allow these really ancient,</v>

357
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.830
<v Speaker 2>horrific methods of dictatorship and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do even worse.</v>

358
00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really fucked up,</v>

359
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.290
<v Speaker 2>they'll put you in the coal mines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you never leave.</v>

360
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 2>You never come out of the coal mine so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get any sunlight,</v>

361
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 2>so your skin starts to fall off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't leave.</v>

362
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

363
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.220
<v Speaker 2>you're living in the coal mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

364
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.260
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad for not crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of North Koreans face labor </v>

365
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 2>can't response in Labor yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

366
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Upset enough about the death of Kim Jong</v>
<v Speaker 2>Il.</v>

367
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

368
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess that's the only way to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cultural.</v>

369
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're going to run it that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a dictator,</v>

370
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to have everybody absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified all the time.</v>

371
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.010
<v Speaker 2>So no one takes a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

372
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.910
<v Speaker 2>How can you maintain that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

373
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they maintaining that?</v>

374
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 2>If your family might get put in jail or </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you,</v>

375
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 2>you'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

376
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

377
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be at like a boiling point.</v>

378
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

379
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 2>These poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the kids,</v>

380
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.970
<v Speaker 2>they move you and they move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They move.</v>

381
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>You like your designated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you live in North Korea?</v>

382
00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:38.541
<v Speaker 2>The neighborhood you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your family was against or for the </v>

383
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:42.710
<v Speaker 2>original founder of North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Jong,</v>

384
00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 2>UN's father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was,</v>

385
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 2>if they were in opposition to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in a very shitty neighborhood.</v>

386
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 2>If they were allowed to have your three </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations later,</v>

387
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:52.910
<v Speaker 2>you live in a good neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

388
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

389
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nice guy.</v>

390
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:01.930
<v Speaker 2>He apparently was mad during the famine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the nineties that people were </v>

391
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dogs were eating Korean dogs.</v>

392
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are national,</v>

393
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:05.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

394
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.360
<v Speaker 2>the agenda has like one of our national </v>
<v Speaker 2>treasures and these people are eating </v>

395
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 2>the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was all irritated.</v>

396
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a good guy.</v>

397
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst country in the world </v>

398
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's always read into that that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so crazy to think that </v>

399
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 2>someone's able to pull that off in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and age.</v>

400
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got nuclear weapons.</v>

401
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan.</v>

402
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

403
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I just have a hard time believing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be maintained.</v>

404
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:38.270
<v Speaker 2>But yet here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It the fact that it's still here in </v>

405
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 2>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty nuts.</v>

406
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
<v Speaker 2>This is like really late in the terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization to have a full on dictator </v>

407
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 2>like that where we look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at those pills.</v>

408
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:51.831
<v Speaker 2>People crying again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine any sort of a scene </v>

409
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:54.630
<v Speaker 2>like that in America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a guy died who was the king?</v>

410
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Can look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all that.</v>

411
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 2>So these poor people are just faking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying.</v>

412
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's terrified to not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have handkerchiefs to stop </v>

413
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 2>crying too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

414
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

415
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it's madness.</v>

416
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:15.891
<v Speaker 2>It's probably what a lot of history was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about when you had a king and he was </v>

417
00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:18.210
<v Speaker 2>absolute ruler and if he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopath.</v>

418
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Luckily if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky,</v>

419
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:22.650
<v Speaker 2>you got a good king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who wasn't crazy,</v>

420
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:27.651
<v Speaker 2>God damn dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the nuttiest shit of all nutty </v>

421
00:20:27.651 --> 00:20:30.171
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that there's a still a country </v>

422
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:30.171
<v Speaker 2>of millions of people that live like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

423
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know God damn.</v>

424
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.430
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whenever people talk about </v>

425
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.130
<v Speaker 2>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white privilege,</v>

426
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:43.430
<v Speaker 2>black privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever kind of privilege you might </v>

427
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.430
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual privilege.</v>

428
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Here's the biggest privilege not having </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live like those folks.</v>

429
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's number</v>

430
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.110
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Above all else that isn't that,</v>

431
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.140
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the reason?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big reasons to at least read </v>

432
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 1>the newspaper or a little history or </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on in the world.</v>

433
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Have some perspective anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get it.</v>

434
00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

435
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mean that the term white privilege,</v>

436
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 1>like people don't like that term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get mad,</v>

437
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>which usually means there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity to it,</v>

438
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says like white privilege and </v>

439
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you see a white dude role in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have a little racist.</v>

463
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 1>your head to the floor is darker than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your skin.</v>

464
00:22:01.721 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 1>That's when you know somebody really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really religious.</v>

465
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.320

<v Speaker 1>Islam world.</v>

466
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What happens if you're a pussy and want </v>

468
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.281
<v Speaker 1>like a little little pillow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little soft pillow or they get mad at </v>

<v Speaker 1>I never heard of this before.</v>

490
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 1>can you teach me something new?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time we talk.</v>

492

<v Speaker 1>That dude has worn a hole in his head </v>

495
00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:22.381
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks.</v>

496
00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard to tell because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly low resolution,</v>

497
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.180
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not a good guy by the way.</v>

498
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.180
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

499
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and assignment were good buddies.</v>

500
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:33.430
<v Speaker 1>He's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still out there.</v>

501
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.920
<v Speaker 1>They don't know where he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

502
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're using.</v>

503
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Very religious and very violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a movie.</v>

504
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>We really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really live in a movie.</v>

505
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>We live in a</v>

506
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 2>movie and it's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean?</v>

507
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 2>You mean just the fact that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans are in general.</v>

508
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 2>The whole world is theater and it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

509
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's real,</v>

510
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing out,</v>

511
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 2>it's so goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a work of fiction.</v>

512
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.250
<v Speaker 2>The North Korea thing seems like a work </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fiction.</v>

513
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.640
<v Speaker 2>The Uber pious gentleman dressed like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>genie who's worn a hole in his head from</v>

514
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:15.641
<v Speaker 2>praying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a character in a fucking </v>

515
00:24:15.641 --> 00:24:15.641
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

516
00:24:15.641 --> 00:24:17.980
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't find them phase out there and</v>

517
00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 2>make is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a doctor.</v>

518
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:24.731
<v Speaker 2>He's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got millions of dollars </v>

519
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:24.731
<v Speaker 2>and they can't find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

520
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:28.240
<v Speaker 2>When his Batman coming in were his </v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman is.</v>

521
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

522
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.990
<v Speaker 2>It's also weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people have plans and they pull </v>

523
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:34.990
<v Speaker 2>them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they just get together and go,</v>

524
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.981
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys were gonna hijack planes and </v>

525
00:24:38.981 --> 00:24:38.981
<v Speaker 2>fly them into buildings.</v>

526
00:24:38.981 --> 00:24:40.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do Bengazi.</v>

527
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

528
00:24:42.691 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

529
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit different events that have happened </v>

530
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.080
<v Speaker 2>all over the world where people kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>their mouth shut,</v>

531
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.690
<v Speaker 2>plotted them and executed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Carlin and says this beautifully,</v>

532
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.960
<v Speaker 2>he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we always talk about they live in the </v>

533
00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:58.960
<v Speaker 2>age of terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

534
00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:58.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lineage Tara,</v>

535
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Tara was actually since 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he tells me a fascinating story.</v>

536
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know the origins of World </v>
<v Speaker 2>War One,</v>

537
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 2>it's very important because the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>war one and World War Two,</v>

538
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.890
<v Speaker 2>our connected World War Two is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuation of World War One and about </v>

539
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 2>80 or 90 million people lost their lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of those two wars.</v>

540
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.800
<v Speaker 2>And Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it destroyed all of old Europe.</v>

541
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it changed the entire map of the </v>

542
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.830
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

543
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 2>And all of us live in its wake in a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper and more turbulent way.</v>

544
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Then you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

545
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:25.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in fact,</v>

546
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>let me keep going.</v>

547
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 2>If you want to know about the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>East,</v>

548
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:29.710
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to study World War II.</v>

549
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

550
00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:36.191
<v Speaker 2>historian will take you seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Dan Carlin says something </v>

551
00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:38.981
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know the story said </v>

552
00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:40.650
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War One and the world you live in </v>

553
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.380
<v Speaker 2>was changed by one man and his name was </v>
<v Speaker 2>carvello princess.</v>

554
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>And he was a Serbian terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he found out that the archduke </v>

555
00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 2>ferdinand of the ostrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarian Empire doesn't matter,</v>

556
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.450
<v Speaker 2>was coming to town and they had control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Serbia and Serbia was looking for </v>

557
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:55.910
<v Speaker 2>their independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

558
00:25:55.911 --> 00:26:00.911
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kill this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was in an open car with his wife </v>

559
00:26:00.911 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 2>and he was in a parade and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Serbian terrorists came running out with</v>

560
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:06.210
<v Speaker 2>a grenade or a bomb through it at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car and it went it.</v>

561
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:10.020
<v Speaker 2>It had a faulty thing and it blew up </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the other car.</v>

562
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.960
<v Speaker 2>And six out of six people were very </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly injured.</v>

563
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I think one person was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>

564
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Our stoop,</v>

565
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.330

<v Speaker 2>They apologize to him.</v>

567
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Speaker 2>And it remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was in Serbia,</v>

568
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.620
<v Speaker 2>it was in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Sara Aviel,</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

570
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 2>of the Servo Hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Austrian Hungarian Empire.</v>

571
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:34.751
<v Speaker 2>Here was the next in line for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the in charge of the Austrian Hungarian </v>

572

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we missed our assassination attempt.</v>

578
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 2>This Guy Carvello Prinsep who was part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this whole group,</v>

579
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:55.010
<v Speaker 2>goes in for a sandwich and as the arts </v>
<v Speaker 2>duke for advanced and let's get you out </v>

580
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>of here.</v>

581
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

582
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:01.371
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to the hospital and I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to check on all the survivors of this </v>

583
00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:01.371
<v Speaker 2>bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

584
00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:05.631
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go down a road and the guy </v>

585
00:27:05.631 --> 00:27:07.731
<v Speaker 2>misses his turn and he misses his turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now he decides to back up and as </v>

586
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 2>he's backing up the car stalls and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to kind of figure it out.</v>

587
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 2>And as the car stalls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he missed a turn,</v>

588
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Carvello Prinsep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this Serbian thing comes walking</v>

589
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 2>out with a sandwich and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

590
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 2>There's the archduke Ferdinand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just right in front of me.</v>

591
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 2>And he shoots him and he shoots his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>

592
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And that was because the driver missed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn and was backing up.</v>

593
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:33.441
<v Speaker 2>And carvello by coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sees the archduke and shoots him </v>

594
00:27:33.441 --> 00:27:36.740
<v Speaker 2>and that pin as Dan Collins has that </v>
<v Speaker 2>created the hand grenade that was World </v>

595
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.210
<v Speaker 2>War One and World War Two was because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>driver missed a turn and because one </v>

596
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 2>terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:20</v>

597
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:45.660
<v Speaker 2>year old guy had a gun in his hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

598
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a bad guy and shot him.</v>

599
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And our world has changed forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that strange missed turn.</v>

600
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what's fascinating about </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

601
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.270
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one is the.</v>

602
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 2>It's called the name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called.</v>

603
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called countdown to Armageddon.</v>

604
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:05.601
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is awesome and I'm glad we got a </v>

605
00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:06.060
<v Speaker 2>chance to blueprint for getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>blueprint farmer.</v>

606
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad I had a chance to drive in a</v>

607
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:13.761
<v Speaker 2>car with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a long trip and we could listen </v>

608
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:13.761
<v Speaker 2>to Dan Carlin's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mongoltauge.</v>

609
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.800
<v Speaker 2>You opened a whole can of worms for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been telling you how crazy that </v>

610
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like forever.</v>

611
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got to listen to this podcast.</v>

612
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:23.310
<v Speaker 2>When people say that to me though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to take them seriously while I</v>

613
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:28.311
<v Speaker 2>just got to listen to another podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you listened to wrath of the </v>

614
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 2>cons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be a changed human being,</v>

615
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.290
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

616
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.320
<v Speaker 2>You will understand what it was like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in that time as best as anybody </v>

617
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.301
<v Speaker 2>could ever describe it in a way that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so ultimately paralyzingly,</v>

618
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:46.911
<v Speaker 2>terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>900 years old or whatever the fuck it </v>

619
00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:46.911
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean because you're in your.</v>

620
00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:49.840
<v Speaker 2>You're huddled in your church with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family and they're at the direct,</v>

621
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.640
<v Speaker 2>the gates in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're bashing your gates down.</v>

622
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.940
<v Speaker 2>You know they're going to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill everybody.</v>

623
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.570
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

624
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Eight hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>700 years ago,</v>

625
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get your head cut off.</v>

626
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 2>You're going to die by by stabbing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting.</v>

627
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.940
<v Speaker 2>It's going to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were launching bodies.</v>

628
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:10.941
<v Speaker 2>They would light bodies on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>launched them with catapults and that </v>

629
00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:15.650
<v Speaker 2>human fat burns better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently when you really light it on </v>

630
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can catch things on fire better.</v>

631
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 2>They were so fucking ruthless.</v>

632
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 2>While I was thinking about how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

633
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I,</v>

634
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.200
<v Speaker 2>we'd go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we live outside and for four days or </v>

635
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.621
<v Speaker 2>three days sometimes and it's miserable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we wake up and we're freezing and </v>

636
00:29:30.621 --> 00:29:34.691
<v Speaker 2>we're wet and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this pillows can wait to get back to </v>

637
00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:34.691
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do it because we love it.</v>

638
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.740
<v Speaker 2>It brings us a close to objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality where like I feel a little </v>

639
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:39.740
<v Speaker 2>tougher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more manly,</v>

640
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mongols I was thinking about how </v>

641
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:44.340
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of trying to picture it there</v>

642
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>on a horse by the time they're three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live in the.</v>

643
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To stop and think about that.</v>

644
00:29:46.801 --> 00:29:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just start there.</v>

645
00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw the kid on a horse and I have a </v>

646
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 2>four year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not running any fucking horse.</v>

647
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Looks no fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially wild horse in the tar tars.</v>

648
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Fairly broken and these still have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 of them per Pi Whistle.</v>

649
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no idea their horses show up.</v>

650
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

651
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I never had heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how the.</v>

652
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:11.610
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the most terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>things is like how well organized they </v>

653
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:11.610
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

654
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 2>because that's how they would hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would hunt on horseback.</v>

655
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.660
<v Speaker 2>They were such trick riders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been on a horse since you were </v>

656
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:18.660
<v Speaker 2>three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do anything on a horse,</v>

657
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot an Arrow on her horse.</v>

658
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 2>You're just much faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>

659
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:23.290
<v Speaker 2>What was the were the clinical reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>came in?</v>

660
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives were so violent to begin </v>

661
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:28.560
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

662
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 2>they lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The staple was mayor milk and blood from</v>

663
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 2>their horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they would mix.</v>

664
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.680
<v Speaker 2>They had mixed the milk and the blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would drink it and I wonder </v>

665
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 2>what that does to chemically what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tastes good.</v>

666
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Probably knocking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many parasites did they have in </v>

667
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.320
<v Speaker 2>their body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time they were like 10 years,</v>

668
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:49.350
<v Speaker 2>God knows or none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would chase because they would </v>

669
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.350
<v Speaker 2>ferment the milk and they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would.</v>

670
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 2>The way they would hunt animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they would do the same with humans,</v>

671
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:57.211
<v Speaker 2>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would sort of push them all into </v>

672
00:30:57.211 --> 00:30:59.821
<v Speaker 2>one area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then create an opening for them to run </v>

673
00:30:59.821 --> 00:30:59.821
<v Speaker 2>through and then they'd been waiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a party there.</v>

674
00:30:59.821 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 2>They were so just daily existence was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical and violent and they had </v>

675
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.940
<v Speaker 2>ultimate disdain for people that live </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind walls.</v>

676
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 2>They lived in felt tense and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like their whole thing.</v>

677
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:16.111
<v Speaker 2>It's like the actual description of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were calling Genghis Khan,</v>

678
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.800
<v Speaker 2>something about ruler of all who dwell </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the tents.</v>

679
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing crazy that they would show </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in town and they would say,</v>

680
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:30.001
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you guys weren't aware that you </v>

<v Speaker 2>which most absolutely is,</v>

693
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.650

709
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 2>other history thing I've ever witnessed </v>

711
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.280
<v Speaker 1>past 20 years at least listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of like the turning </v>

712
00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 1>points in European history and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the teaching company,</v>

00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 1>really good professors and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>compares to that guy.</v>

714
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

715
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:54.990
<v Speaker 1>there's so many good podcasts right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like there's a,</v>

716
00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking with someone yesterday </v>

717
00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.831
<v Speaker 1>about how many good tv shows there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>today as opposed to like when we were </v>

718
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.570
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were kids.</v>

719
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what was a really good show on TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Mash,</v>

720
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess mash was a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it like a really good drama was</v>

721
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.010
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

722
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Hill street blues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hill street blues was great,</v>

723
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.630
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only one I can think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the hill street blues is later.</v>

724
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that.</v>

725
00:33:21.971 --> 00:33:23.910
<v Speaker 1>It was 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it really?</v>

726
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Actually it was 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>81.</v>

727
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have that all fucked up in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head?</v>

728
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I haven't fucked up with NYP ed </v>

729
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

730
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

731
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.410
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

732
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.520
<v Speaker 1>A good drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a good drama right now.</v>

733
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Compare that to what's available today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare that to game of thrones.</v>

734
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Walking dead mad men breaking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better.</v>

735
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Call Saul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

736
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.260
<v Speaker 1>House of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homeland.</v>

737
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

738
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:56.051
<v Speaker 1>I can't even keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salt of wizard shows they're so goddamn </v>

739
00:33:56.051 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 1>good and you got to be good because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have those hbo shows.</v>

740
00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:03.641
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those hbo shows took everything to a </v>

741
00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:04.490
<v Speaker 1>totally different level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they put out the soprano's,</v>

742
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the whole game changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you're like,</v>

743
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is better than a movie.</v>

744
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a movie that's forever because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a character.</v>

745
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.680
<v Speaker 1>It used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule was that character has to be </v>

746
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.631
<v Speaker 1>somebody you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you want to bring in your living </v>

747
00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:22.271
<v Speaker 1>room every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the rule and when you went to </v>

748
00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 1>pitch a show and your character wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote likable,</v>

749
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.040
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

750
00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Along comes Tony Soprano,</v>

751
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 1>huge adulterer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderer,</v>

752
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.860
<v Speaker 1>kill his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his friend and tells his son to do his </v>

753
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the same breath,</v>

754
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 1>talk about a dichotomy and and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>as human beings,</v>

755
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:40.400
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

756
00:34:40.401 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 1>that's real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel sometimes.</v>

757
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.500
<v Speaker 1>He was the courageous mob character in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of mob characters over the </v>

758
00:34:50.061 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the hill,</v>

759
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 1>through the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the mountain,</v>

760
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 1>through the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else can suck his dick.</v>

761
00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 1>All of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all can suck his dead.</v>

762
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.220
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the greatest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

763
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I think me and shop and a couple other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were talking about the best </v>

764
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.730
<v Speaker 1>overall character on TV ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

765
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's got to be Tony Soprano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vet or Walter White.</v>

766
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 1>The felons or why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good bet.</v>

767
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

768
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I was torn between the two and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately went with Walter,</v>

769
00:35:15.771 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 1>but I might say now because of peer </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

770
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Tony Soprano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

771
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

772
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.650
<v Speaker 1>there's been some goddamn good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

773
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 1>but that his character had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had so much time to get to know him.</v>

774
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

775
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>and that's just so different was that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

776
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:37.870
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like television style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like show making.</v>

777
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.280
<v Speaker 3>It was movie making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a new thing because it was </v>

778
00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 3>really complex and you could do it over </v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time.</v>

779
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.090
<v Speaker 3>You could have a season and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

780
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:53.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling a story over months and </v>

781
00:35:53.091 --> 00:35:53.091
<v Speaker 3>months and you're getting people </v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted.</v>

782
00:35:53.091 --> 00:35:57.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a completely different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you realized like at a certain </v>

783
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.410
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>

784
00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 3>that show changed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That changed everything.</v>

785
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.970
<v Speaker 3>It was just so next level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

786
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I never gave a fuck about mob shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

787
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 3>it was one before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a way.</v>

788
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:12.870
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a mach show in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a guy running two families,</v>

789
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.060
<v Speaker 3>a crime family and his own family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

790
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.270
<v Speaker 3>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were looking at a human being and</v>

791
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 3>what I think they did an amazing job was</v>
<v Speaker 3>as evil as he was,</v>

792
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 3>they were putting them in impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

793
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.500
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't run that fucking crime </v>
<v Speaker 3>family without being a complete </v>

794
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet he had to run his own family,</v>

795
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 3>make marriage work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

796
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know a lot of people identified</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the impossible life is that way.</v>

797
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an extreme example,</v>

798
00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:40.840
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

799
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 3>it is really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we could almost,</v>

800
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.260
<v Speaker 3>if you were born that guy and that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and that guy's life and that </v>

801
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.810
<v Speaker 3>guy's neighborhood with that guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

802
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 3>you would be in the exact same situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he is right now at chain of events.</v>

803
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 3>From the time you were shot out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother's,</v>

804
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Vijay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jj has led you to where you're at.</v>

805
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 3>It's just like looking at those North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korean people.</v>

806
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:05.301
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should they pull themselves up by their </v>

807
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:07.161
<v Speaker 3>bootstraps?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what should they do to anyone to </v>

808
00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:07.161
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

809
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:07.960
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

810
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where everybody's got to hug.</v>

811
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.670
<v Speaker 3>My friend Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was born in Africa,</v>

812
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:14.000
<v Speaker 3>but he said I want to be American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he got in the car.</v>

813
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.020
<v Speaker 3>He drove to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 3>you know those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they wanted to,</v>

815
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:19.240
<v Speaker 3>they could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

816
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.110
<v Speaker 3>do you know what the fuck you said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You anecdotal asshole.</v>

817
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.380
<v Speaker 3>He told one shitty story about some </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed friend that probably doesn't </v>

818
00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:27.960
<v Speaker 3>even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was born in the step.</v>

819
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I remember the argument with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you make.</v>

820
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:36.110
<v Speaker 3>If you make the sanction strong enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his people will get so miserable that </v>

821
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.291
<v Speaker 3>Delta overthrow the go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try overthrown that guy when he </v>

822
00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:39.291
<v Speaker 3>kills your whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:41.910
<v Speaker 3>They're the ruthlessness that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people operate under.</v>

824
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:46.911
<v Speaker 3>Like if you live in American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't experienced war and you </v>

825
00:37:46.911 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 3>start talking about stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like start talking crazy,</v>

826
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.060
<v Speaker 3>but do you remember there was a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the debates that John Mccain,</v>

827
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.120
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anytime you've got Sarah Pailin </v>

828
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 3>as your fucking running mate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hamstrung,</v>

829
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:00.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

830
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're basically over because no </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

831
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.890
<v Speaker 3>no one rational is going to say yes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

832
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got someone have really </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly marginal marginable </v>

833
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

834
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a very marginal right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the way she communicates,</v>

835
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:16.170
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's obviously not very bright.</v>

836
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:21.230
<v Speaker 3>She's certainly very myopic in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience and her perspective.</v>

837
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:24.270
<v Speaker 3>She's got that down home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folksy thing going on,</v>

838
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems,</v>

839
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 3>which is very poorly thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are people that are down home</v>

840
00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:31.950
<v Speaker 3>and folks when you talk to them their </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of communicating,</v>

841
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.880
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

842
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 3>you can still get through that to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

843
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

844
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 1>is an intelligent nuanced person with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of depth to what they're saying.</v>

845
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:43.870
<v Speaker 1>This is just the way they they talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe from Wisconsin.</v>

846
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's like Doug Durant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our friend Doug.</v>

847
00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From Wisconsin.</v>

848
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy and brilliant.</v>

849
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant guy.</v>

850
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>If you underestimate him because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer in Wisconsin,</v>

851
00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 1>we'd be in for a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

852
00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:02.101
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that some someone has to </v>

853
00:39:02.101 --> 00:39:05.041
<v Speaker 1>fit into any particular style of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication just to Napa and we were </v>

854
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 1>talking about what was the wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was canvas,</v>

855
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:14.941
<v Speaker 1>which is a high end wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $200 a bottle and she was saying </v>

856
00:39:14.941 --> 00:39:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that the guy who makes the wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you buy a winery and a </v>

857
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.701
<v Speaker 1>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please be ready to spend if it's </v>

858
00:39:20.701 --> 00:39:20.701
<v Speaker 1>special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>select 325 bucks and you'd think this is</v>

859
00:39:20.701 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 1>a genius winemaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>

860
00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 1>he's a farmer at parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of farmer.</v>

861
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 1>He grows good grapes and then kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>does the thing that he was told,</v>

862
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:33.721
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wagner is a farmer and and you had </v>

863
00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:34.030
<v Speaker 1>underestimated him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw him in his overalls and you'd be</v>

864
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:39.031
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that guy's one of the best </v>

865
00:39:39.031 --> 00:39:39.031
<v Speaker 1>winemakers in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will those folks that we were talking to</v>

866
00:39:39.031 --> 00:39:40.780

<v Speaker 1>the Rainelle is friends.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How about that was so cool.</v>

870
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.470
<v Speaker 1>The food was delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I saw that guy and I saw that</v>

871
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 1>he was cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried tips.</v>

872
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker.</v>

873
00:39:52.601 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you could cook the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a tri tip.</v>

874
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.210
<v Speaker 1>However you said old California dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old rancher,</v>

875
00:39:58.211 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they know how to cook those tri tips?</v>

876
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Because it tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tip is a very peculiar type of meat.</v>

877
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It's very lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't overcook it.</v>

878
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.320
<v Speaker 1>You got to cook it the right amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a lot of fat on it,</v>

879
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.870
<v Speaker 1>but if you know how to nail it and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

880
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>California ranchers,</v>

882
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.360

<v Speaker 1>and it cranks and as you're cranking,</v>

883
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you're like raise or lower it above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the heat and you want to make it </v>

886
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 1>they have thermometers was just how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fork would go into it.</v>

887
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 1>They could figure out like how done it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just by how the fork felt,</v>

888
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 1>how it slid into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw that dude and I saw he was </v>

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 1>cavities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's we'd.</v>

943
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Where'd it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado is Colorado.</v>

944
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Is Florida in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Dude.</v>

945
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that real?</v>

946
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think in the fifties,</v>

947
00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:55.421
<v Speaker 1>what they found with certain communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado that we're not getting </v>

948
00:42:55.421 --> 00:42:55.421
<v Speaker 1>cavities thing.</v>

949
00:42:55.421 --> 00:42:56.290
<v Speaker 1>It's in Colorado and they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why.</v>

950
00:42:56.291 --> 00:43:01.291
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't the kids getting cavities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they found there's a high level of </v>

951
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:01.291
<v Speaker 1>Florida and the water naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

952
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does happen,</v>

953
00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:03.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a.</v>

954
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 1>there's some waters that have higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of fluoride,</v>

955
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:07.720
<v Speaker 1>like natural fluoride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

956
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And apparently there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things it's supposed </v>

957
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.550
<v Speaker 1>to be not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you drink distilled water,</v>

958
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 1>they say don't know because you want all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those minerals and all that other jazz.</v>

959
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 1>It's in water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very much so.</v>

960
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:24.281
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe you used distilled water </v>

961
00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:24.281
<v Speaker 1>on a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times the plant dies.</v>

962
00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:28.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was told from a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people think that fluoride </v>

963
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:32.350
<v Speaker 1>ultimately is not good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any science that goes with </v>

964
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:32.720
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people love to quote.</v>

965
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:34.450
<v Speaker 1>They always say this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

966
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 1>calcifies your pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

967
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 1>have you done any lab biopsies?</v>

968
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 1>If we have a pretty good big control </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

969
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the entire population of the United</v>

970
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.870
<v Speaker 1>States over the past 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a lot of people with </v>

971
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:50.470
<v Speaker 1>calcified pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland.</v>

972
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's even a real thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Sarah.</v>

973
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible guy isn't the pineal </v>

974
00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:57.610
<v Speaker 1>gland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

975
00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:58.970
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're saying is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>always feels a little stiff.</v>

976
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't see out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that much.</v>

977
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.530

<v Speaker 1>they say that maybe snopes this Jamie.</v>

978
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:08.531
<v Speaker 1>They said you do that fluoride in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water was pioneered by the Nazis for </v>

<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>

1036
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 1>What is the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause no teeth to this claim.</v>

1037
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can almost guarantee you that it is </v>

1038
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.260
<v Speaker 1>indeed in the urban myth said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole injury.</v>

1039
00:47:03.261 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Who handles the media relations with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US Holocaust memorial museum.</v>

1040
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1041
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1042
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's not real done right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or could be.</v>

1043
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't about Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida in water.</v>

1044
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It was communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>

1045
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like more than likely it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an urban myth.</v>

1046
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what about,</v>

1047
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.550
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Google this fluoride calcifies the</v>

1048
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just want to get to the bottom</v>

1049
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:34.480
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get to the bottom of this.</v>

1050
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Studies have been done on the pineal </v>
<v Speaker 1>gland.</v>

1051
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 1>What happens if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's floor?</v>

1052
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 1>I do it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are they going to clone hair?</v>

1053
00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:43.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1054
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 1>you can get hairier fluoride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deposition age,</v>

1055
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:50.590
<v Speaker 1>human pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1056
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.770
<v Speaker 1>So is it saying to pot?</v>

1057
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.840
<v Speaker 1>The purpose was discover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That purpose was to discover whether </v>

1058
00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.150
<v Speaker 1>fluoride accumulates in the aged human </v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland.</v>

1059
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:05.920
<v Speaker 1>The aims were to determine a f </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrations of the pineal gland,</v>

1060
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.570
<v Speaker 1>wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

1061
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Corresponding muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wet and bone ash be counseling.</v>

1062
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Calcium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration of the pineal,</v>

1063
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:21.330
<v Speaker 1>pineal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle and bone were dissected from 11 </v>

1064
00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>aged cadavers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1065
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:25.440
<v Speaker 1>What does it say to or too much reading?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take A.</v>

1066
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a calcium pineal gland then </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold her teeth.</v>

1067
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 1>My teeth suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes right here.</v>

1068
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Fluoride does not accumulate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain who.</v>

1069
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1070
00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 1>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you would really do that though.</v>

1071
00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:39.790
<v Speaker 1>You would take of calcium and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland.</v>

1072
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It means saying it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if it was real?</v>

1073
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew t.</v>

1074
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1075
00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want holes in my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go with dentists.</v>

1076
00:48:46.811 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Dentists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland.</v>

1077
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I do makes Melatonin Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe now that it makes </v>

1078
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine that really heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>duty psychedelic.</v>

1079
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a bunch of different things.</v>

1080
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take Melatonin pills and have good </v>

1081
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it looks like.</v>

1082
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.720
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing about the pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen the look,</v>

1083
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>look up a Egyptian image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland.</v>

1084
00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.880
<v Speaker 1>The actual like side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1085
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.280
<v Speaker 1>view of the pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know it was actually a </v>

1086
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.581
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was like the third </v>

1087
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:23.581
<v Speaker 1>item is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1088
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:23.581
<v Speaker 1>it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really fucked up.</v>

1089
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Look what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like that thing a lot,</v>

1090
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:31.830
<v Speaker 1>that Egyptian solo a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the actual structure </v>

1091
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.550
<v Speaker 1>of the pineal gland and that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

1092
00:49:33.551 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably someone super smart is watching</v>

1093
00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 1>you bitch too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like to me,</v>

1094
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super similar in appearance with the </v>

1095
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.240
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland looks like and what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing looks like.</v>

1096
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.240
<v Speaker 1>If it's dissected and cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that the Egyptians did their </v>

1097
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.450
<v Speaker 1>sheriff cutting brains up and being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at that thing nest.</v>

1098
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>That's where the pineal gland is way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of the brain.</v>

1099
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was right to write in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead.</v>

1100
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1101
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like look where your eyeballs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1102
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like literally like right </v>

1103
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:09.220
<v Speaker 1>here and back like right where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brainstem right in there.</v>

1104
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they think that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertain,</v>

1105
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:17.740
<v Speaker 1>like lower animals like snakes I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>or reptiles.</v>

1106
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.190
<v Speaker 1>That thing actually has a retina and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lens.</v>

1107
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't see where it says pineal gland </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this thing.</v>

1108
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a backup there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1109
00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what the gland is and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is.</v>

1110
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1111
00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.640
<v Speaker 1>see where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it show it?</v>

1112
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Does it have a buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thalamus buddy was acquitted </v>

1113
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.000
<v Speaker 1>of that</v>

1114
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.920
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland part one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See pineal gland on the right and there </v>

1115
00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.490
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1116
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither of us know what the fucking </v>

1117
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.350
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a pineal gland is looks like I </v>

1118
00:50:58.350 --> 00:50:59.200
<v Speaker 1>said at the base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How freaky is that?</v>

1119
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all this.</v>

1120
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 1>There's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge that your brain is making </v>

1121
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.211
<v Speaker 1>all these weird chemicals all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and keeping them in balance is super </v>

1122
00:51:12.211 --> 00:51:15.601
<v Speaker 1>important and you can do it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and you can do it with like </v>

1123
00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:20.400
<v Speaker 1>having positive thinking and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and the sun and it's also what </v>

1124
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.481
<v Speaker 1>is the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what sort of what really is it </v>

1125
00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:24.481
<v Speaker 1>really is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1126
00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:27.820
<v Speaker 1>what kind of some sort of blows my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a.</v>

1127
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.280
<v Speaker 1>As it's functioning as it's all lit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1128
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's some sort of a portal to everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universe and that's really what </v>

1129
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.431
<v Speaker 1>the brain is and eventually that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing will get to a point where </v>

1130
00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it's capable of communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody within any reasonable distance </v>

1131
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.110
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

1132
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So as this brain continues to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

1133
00:51:54.341 --> 00:51:59.341
<v Speaker 1>accumulate more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulate more technological </v>

1134
00:51:59.341 --> 00:52:03.130
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs that allow it to do more </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and manipulate matter more.</v>

1135
00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:08.131
<v Speaker 1>As long as it stays alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as the human organism stays </v>

1136
00:52:08.131 --> 00:52:11.401
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've thought of it as a giant super </v>

1137
00:52:11.401 --> 00:52:11.401
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:52:11.401 --> 00:52:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's something that if you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in terms of the creation of the </v>

1139
00:52:14.561 --> 00:52:17.170
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is billions of years old.</v>

1140
00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:22.171
<v Speaker 1>It took a long fucking time to go from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first version of the earth.</v>

1141
00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:26.590
<v Speaker 1>All the rocks and the lava and the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit to what we have today.</v>

1142
00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1143
00:52:28.571 --> 00:52:33.571
<v Speaker 1>I think the human organism takes a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass time to become what it really is and</v>

1144
00:52:34.301 --> 00:52:39.301
<v Speaker 1>what it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the universe figured out how to build</v>

1145
00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:44.671
<v Speaker 1>something that can make a universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I was going to say that the human </v>

1146
00:52:44.671 --> 00:52:48.361
<v Speaker 1>brand is going to get to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's able to replicate itself and then </v>

1147
00:52:48.361 --> 00:52:51.421
<v Speaker 1>improve on itself and you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>download other people's brains and </v>

1148
00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you'll be able to send your download to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's brands and you'll have an</v>

1149
00:52:55.151 --> 00:53:00.151
<v Speaker 1>experience of what it's like to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and there's some people that </v>

1150
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:00.151
<v Speaker 1>resist this because they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1151
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>we already right now don't know nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough about the biological functions of</v>

1152
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:03.700
<v Speaker 1>human body.</v>

1153
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:08.470
<v Speaker 1>We already right now don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely understand that and I agree</v>

1154
00:53:08.471 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 1>that they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1155
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
00:53:09.881 --> 00:53:14.881
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disputing that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I am saying though is it might not </v>

1157
00:53:14.881 --> 00:53:18.541
<v Speaker 1>even matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be able to come up with </v>

1158
00:53:18.541 --> 00:53:20.110
<v Speaker 1>technology that completely circumvents </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the biological bullshit that we have</v>

1159
00:53:20.111 --> 00:53:25.111
<v Speaker 1>to deal with as far as like processing </v>
<v Speaker 1>proteins and vital nutrients and all </v>

1160
00:53:25.111 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>that horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could possibly</v>

1161
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.310
<v Speaker 2>bypass that one day by meshing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

1162
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

1163
00:53:32.131 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I know you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aubrey de Grey on your podcast.</v>

1164
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I had in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having them on again,</v>

1165
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I had him on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm having them on the podcast real </v>

1166
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:41.720
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1167
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.441
<v Speaker 2>because I was talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about there are seven </v>

1168
00:53:45.441 --> 00:53:45.441
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a cell.</v>

1169
00:53:45.441 --> 00:53:49.360
<v Speaker 2>There are seven different ways of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerates and they're working on </v>

1170
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.370
<v Speaker 2>figuring out ways to stop that </v>
<v Speaker 2>degeneration.</v>

1171
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:52.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a mechanical issue at this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're.</v>

1172
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:57.310
<v Speaker 2>They're isolating how cell breaks down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it does and they're going to try to </v>

1173
00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1174
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I said nanotechnology and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1175
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a chance that all your work </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be circled circumnavigated by just</v>

1176
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that inexorable rise toward,</v>

1177
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:12.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of pushing us way beyond our </v>

1178
00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:12.831
<v Speaker 2>biology with machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1179
00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:12.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

1180
00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:12.831
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1181
00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I think if you look at it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the long haul,</v>

1182
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.960
<v Speaker 3>well let's just assume that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to stay alive and not below each </v>

1183
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.360
<v Speaker 3>other up or not get hit by a meteor for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the long haul.</v>

1184
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Let's give us a 100 years to have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea how goddamn crazy technology is </v>

1185
00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:34.631
<v Speaker 3>going to be in a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anybody looks at it's pooling is we </v>

1186
00:54:34.631 --> 00:54:38.351
<v Speaker 3>don't have the capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that that's what they </v>

1187
00:54:38.351 --> 00:54:41.030
<v Speaker 3>said back when they lived in caves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would we got to block that hole?</v>

1188
00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:43.550
<v Speaker 3>We can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how they had to figure out</v>

1189
00:54:43.551 --> 00:54:45.020
<v Speaker 3>how to make a fucking door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1190
00:54:45.021 --> 00:54:47.030
<v Speaker 3>so when you had to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a door to a cave,</v>

1191
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:52.240
<v Speaker 3>somebody had to figure out fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody had to figure out stone tools </v>

1192
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.270
<v Speaker 3>and then we learned from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all keep steam rolling and apparently</v>

1193
00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:58.040
<v Speaker 3>the brain is evolving as well.</v>

1194
00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.520
<v Speaker 3>The brain is evolving in the way that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>interfaces with computers.</v>

1195
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:06.670
<v Speaker 3>The way we process information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all directly with our way of the </v>

1196
00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.880
<v Speaker 3>allocation of resources mentally is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>different now than it was before.</v>

1197
00:55:10.881 --> 00:55:14.510
<v Speaker 3>You could just ask Google a question is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is some weird.</v>

1198
00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Shit's going to happen to the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1199
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:22.060
<v Speaker 3>If we start adding things to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we start putting in little </v>

1200
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 3>transmitters or little things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little little way,</v>

1201
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:25.760
<v Speaker 3>ways to wireless interface with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1202
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:28.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I've talked about this,</v>

1203
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.610
<v Speaker 3>that experiment that they did where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent a word,</v>

1204
00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:36.640
<v Speaker 3>they sent a couple of words from one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person to the other person through the </v>

1205
00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Internet and they received the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were blindfolded.</v>

1206
00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:39.440
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1207
00:55:39.441 --> 00:55:44.441
<v Speaker 3>they put take all these steps to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that the way they're receiving it </v>

1208
00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:44.840
<v Speaker 3>was only brain to brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1209
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:45.870
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1210
00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:50.880
<v Speaker 3>we're getting like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the baby steps of some really </v>

1211
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.330
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we could just stay alive.</v>

1212
00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.250
<v Speaker 3>If you can stay alive for like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1213
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:57.680
<v Speaker 3>the world will be unrecognizable.</v>

1214
00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that's the case in 40 or 50.</v>

1215
00:55:59.901 --> 00:56:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Ray Kurzweil says in 40 or 50 years it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

1216
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.260
<v Speaker 2>He might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1217
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Because it's moving so exponentially and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minute machine start replicating </v>

1218
00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.030
<v Speaker 2>themselves are building better machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1219
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Comes with a very dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also comes from a very promising </v>

1220
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.170
<v Speaker 2>sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just reject it.</v>

1221
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Biologist reject it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes a lot of them do.</v>

1222
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:19.970
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of them do because they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they don't.</v>

1223
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:25.150
<v Speaker 2>We don't know enough about the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind to even come close to saying that </v>

1224
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:29.641
<v Speaker 2>we could replicate it or download </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness into a computer and that </v>

1225
00:56:29.641 --> 00:56:32.590
<v Speaker 2>seems to be the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I think is it's,</v>

1226
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:37.950
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the case of technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaching a level of capability that we </v>

1227
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 2>can't even fathom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't fathom it.</v>

1228
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:49.040
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too far away from our little pea </v>

1229
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:49.040
<v Speaker 2>brains right now.</v>

1230
00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>So there could be kind of an interface </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can't even imagine.</v>

1231
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can imagine it,</v>

1232
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human imagination exists because </v>

1233
00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 2>that is a window into what is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1234
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:03.150
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1235
00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you can imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a matter of time before</v>

1236
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 2>it actually becomes something you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure and see with your eye,</v>

1237
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 2>your ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or an instrument.</v>

1238
00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually touch.</v>

1239
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:19.891
<v Speaker 2>I think anything that like where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about downloading the human </v>

1240
00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:23.521
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating the way we communicate </v>

1241
00:57:23.521 --> 00:57:26.341
<v Speaker 2>with radio waves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we text texting each other with </v>

1242
00:57:26.341 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 2>our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's magic.</v>

1243
00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:31.531
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's far fetched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at the way science </v>

1244
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:32.350
<v Speaker 2>seems to be developing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of when,</v>

1245
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.030
<v Speaker 2>not if it's so weird.</v>

1246
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 2>If you think about what a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1247
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 2>if you think about like I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching nature documentaries lately,</v>

1248
00:57:40.451 --> 00:57:45.451
<v Speaker 2>man had gone through this one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird stages while I just started </v>

1249
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:46.070
<v Speaker 2>watching documentaries on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1250
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.160
<v Speaker 2>various animals and the just the cruelty</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the environment that they live in,</v>

1251
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:56.350
<v Speaker 2>the cannibalism and the attacking each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and life eats life.</v>

1252
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking chaos,</v>

1253
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:00.790
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watched this documentary on baboons.</v>

1254
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 2>These baboons fucking each other up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1255
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:08.191
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to protect their babies in the </v>

1256
00:58:08.191 --> 00:58:11.760
<v Speaker 2>baboons should the show should have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>called dead baby babble because they </v>

1257
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.680
<v Speaker 2>showed us like 10 fucking dead baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>baboons.</v>

1258
00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:18.940
<v Speaker 2>This scientist on Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ted talk was talking about how </v>

1259
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 2>humans are not the only animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kill each other because you know,</v>

1260
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 2>because you know the animals kill out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance or our food and stuff,</v>

1261
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.340

<v Speaker 2>He's just not being respectful to the </v>

1265
00:58:37.531 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 2>other males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just running around because I kind of</v>

1266
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.760
<v Speaker 2>tried to fuck the the women without </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through the necessary baboons </v>

<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1271
00:58:48.641 --> 00:58:50.950

<v Speaker 2>Next morning he shows the picture.</v>

1272
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:55.951
<v Speaker 2>All they find is the baboon's face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baboon's face basically torn asunder</v>

1273
00:58:56.710 --> 00:59:01.710
<v Speaker 2>through whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every direction and just his perfect </v>

1274

<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got some big deals.</v>

1280
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.810
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

1284
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like any other animal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shake pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1287
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:31.670

<v Speaker 1>if the baboons was in a movie,</v>

1288
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:34.430
<v Speaker 1>like if they didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were in like Lord of the rings,</v>

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:39.520
<v Speaker 1>it would be a terrifying animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an animal that lived in the forest </v>

1290
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:39.870
<v Speaker 1>that was thinking about like stealing </v>

1298
00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:55.940
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a very submissive.</v>

1299
00:59:55.941 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 1>She would fall to the ground and let you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick bugs from her back.</v>

1300
00:59:58.191 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 1>That's how they show submissive </v>
<v Speaker 1>submission,</v>

1301
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.530
<v Speaker 1>but nervous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But with a face to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is real,</v>

1331
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1332
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>if human beings didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we just didn't exist at all on earth,</v>

1333
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>this fucking thing would be out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like it is now if we never would </v>

1334
01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1335
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>If we just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never figured out houses.</v>

1336
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>We never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just.</v>

1337
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>We died off a long fucking time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing would be out there just like </v>

1338
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:50.921
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing would be out there a million </v>

1339
01:01:50.921 --> 01:01:50.921
<v Speaker 1>years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we made it to 2015 with cell </v>

1341
01:01:55.821 --> 01:02:00.821
<v Speaker 1>phones and jet airplanes and microwave </v>
<v Speaker 1>ovens and tvs and laptops and that </v>

1342
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking primate that came up with us.</v>

1343
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>This fucker didn't make it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

1344
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what they always say is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental difference between human </v>

1345
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>beings and animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though we're an animal,</v>

1346
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>we're the only animal with potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the only animal that continues to </v>

1347
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We evolve within our own lives.</v>

1348
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1349
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>we can see in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really observant of yourself and </v>

1350
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>correcting of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll continually evolve.</v>

1351
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be smarter and 10 </v>

1352
01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:32.271
<v Speaker 1>generations and that baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all going to be the same way </v>

1353
01:02:32.271 --> 01:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>they will have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting that you said that </v>

1354
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>because I want to keep hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep saying radiolab,</v>

1355
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>but there was another podcast they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>about instincts and how you could change</v>

1356
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the entire behavior of a tribe of </v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons.</v>

1357
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>If they got rid of this one alpha male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like fucking everybody up.</v>

1358
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1359
01:02:50.431 --> 01:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of twitter.</v>

1360
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of one alpha male that was </v>

1361
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking everybody up and then something </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1362
01:02:56.390 --> 01:03:00.801
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the actual event was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused them to be submissive to each </v>

1363
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:05.961
<v Speaker 1>other and grooming each other and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just kind of kept up with it and </v>

1364
01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:09.411
<v Speaker 1>then they came back years later </v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting to see the same sort of </v>

1365
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>violent behavior that they've witnessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1366
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.570
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had this.</v>

1367
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 1>They had developed this like peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons tribe,</v>

1368
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no.</v>

1369
01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>There was no threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

1370
01:03:17.531 --> 01:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>A way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lesser Threat.</v>

1371
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:23.751
<v Speaker 1>They're still fucking baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the way they dealt with </v>

1372
01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>each other was way more relaxed like and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1373
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:28.290
<v Speaker 1>That was really confusing to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists who observed it.</v>

1374
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.000
<v Speaker 1>It was very unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>

1375
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't say confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a welcomed discovery.</v>

1376
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1377
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.810
<v Speaker 1>how much of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1378
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Like we're talking about North Korea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about America in 2015.</v>

1379
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Look at the difference between the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cultures are allowed to communicate</v>

1380
01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>and express themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by this podcast.</v>

1381
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>You could see the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who lives in a crazy,</v>

1382
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>crazy dictatorship that they're living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in is happening in the same timeline.</v>

1383
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's happening right now.</v>

1384
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to also when you first </v>

1385
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>started this podcast about talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people that are great and there's a</v>

1386
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:06.591
<v Speaker 1>couple of assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes only a couple of assholes in </v>

1387
01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:09.501
<v Speaker 1>charge to change the character of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire society to and make people behave</v>

1388
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 1>in a very crazy way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those baboons changed when you took away</v>

1389
01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:18.381
<v Speaker 1>the alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if North Koreans would be </v>

1390
01:04:18.381 --> 01:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>crying for three hours straight if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a fucking alpha male running</v>

1391
01:04:19.861 --> 01:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>their tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that much of a fucking monster?</v>

1392
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Obviously not.</v>

1393
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember the exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifics of what caused them to chill </v>

1394
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.881
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't remember too much information in </v>

1395
01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:35.211
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a real problem with that </v>

1396
01:04:35.211 --> 01:04:36.501
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to regulate the amount of </v>

1397
01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:37.830
<v Speaker 1>information that's going in my head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then go over it with a fine tooth comb.</v>

1398
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I feel like I'm taking in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day way too much data.</v>

1399
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I feel that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I forgot.</v>

1400
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I can't really remember names and </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifics.</v>

1401
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I have to start talking in general terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.</v>

1402
01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking really about individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and individual subjects of news </v>

1403
01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.280
<v Speaker 1>especially because I feel like if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got online every day and start scouring </v>

1404
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.841
<v Speaker 1>the news and looking for interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and seeing the latest video to </v>

1405
01:05:05.841 --> 01:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>see the silver back gorilla that slammed</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the cage at the zoo.</v>

1406
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1407
01:05:08.961 --> 01:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tight.</v>

1408
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Tighten up your belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite day.</v>

1409
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a little kid that starts doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some chest thumps.</v>

1410
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes she does.</v>

1411
01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And the silverback ain't hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

1412
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see the little kid.</v>

1413
01:05:23.141 --> 01:05:28.141
<v Speaker 1>You could see her in the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's pounding are her hands on her </v>

1414
01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:30.541
<v Speaker 1>chest and this why we never fixed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shitty video quality thing.</v>

1415
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Those little things we bought didn't fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1416
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coco the gorilla with Robin Williams.</v>

1417
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>We still have that really super shaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>video for some reason.</v>

1418
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coco the gorilla.</v>

1419
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he let that thing touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1420
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>They're a lot less dangerous than a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say gorillas have their own </v>

1421
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some can be really mean.</v>

1422
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be really sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was super sweet,</v>

1423
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>but if she wanted to just pull your dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>off stuff at through your eyeball.</v>

1424
01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:00.010
<v Speaker 1>She could anytime she wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a guy,</v>

1425
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:00.810
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1426
01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How thick.</v>

1427
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just pulls him down to look at </v>

1428
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1429
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Can you go full screen on that or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when screws up.</v>

1430
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God.</v>

1431
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like an alien dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1432
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow kisses his hand.</v>

1433
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an amazing time.</v>

1434
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:29.130
<v Speaker 1>This is a bizarre video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wouldn't be so nervous that </v>

1435
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:31.050
<v Speaker 1>things really peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

1436
01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took his glasses and put his glasses </v>

1437
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1438
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:38.290
<v Speaker 1>See that's when it gets really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigo what?</v>

1439
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we dealing with here?</v>

1440
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:45.330
<v Speaker 1>This is like a life form that speaks a </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a sign language with human </v>

1441
01:06:46.721 --> 01:06:48.580
<v Speaker 1>beings so it understands what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

1442
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.680
<v Speaker 1>It just can't vocalize the noises that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to in order to communicate,</v>

1443
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.540
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a crazy animal right there.</v>

1444
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 1>If that thing didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck big foot.</v>

1445
01:07:01.421 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1446
01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Big Foot and his dirty crusty ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big flips.</v>

1447
01:07:06.511 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Not nearly as cool as a Goddamn St.</v>
<v Speaker 1>tickle me.</v>

1448
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take all the girl isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Nazi signs.</v>

1449
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Tickle guys want to see stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing is to me.</v>

1450
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1451
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't even fathom it at a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1452
01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not even the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not fair.</v>

1453
01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like how much stronger you then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flower.</v>

1454
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about just Brennan?</v>

1455
01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Who grabbed me around the waist the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and he was like yesterday.</v>

1456
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1457
01:07:29.731 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I try to shoot a single leg on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1458
01:07:31.691 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it.</v>

1459
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Give it to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so crazy.</v>

1460
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just looking at that body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get them laughing.</v>

1461
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

1462
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts that each other with great </v>
<v Speaker 1>pet.</v>

1463
01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:48.871
<v Speaker 1>You're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid gorilla in your house until he </v>

1464
01:07:48.871 --> 01:07:52.111
<v Speaker 1>decides that he wants to eat your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now they actually are a strict </v>

1465
01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which people find a shocking.</v>

1466
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and people are like,</v>

1467
01:07:56.801 --> 01:08:01.801
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is totally evidence that you can </v>

1468
01:08:01.801 --> 01:08:06.781
<v Speaker 1>eat in all plant diet and you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>immensely massive muscular or it's </v>

1469
01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>evidenced that gorillas are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than people.</v>

1470
01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:12.640
<v Speaker 1>They always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1471
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:14.740
<v Speaker 1>both are so strong and their total </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians.</v>

1472
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Go eat grass and then run a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how you feel.</v>

1473
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with that.</v>

1474
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>You have four stomachs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1475
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're different men.</v>

1476
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a gorilla to different than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person doesn't.</v>

1477
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>It needs only Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coco checks his ID.</v>

1478
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science tickles.</v>

1479
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I went to the Santa Barbara Zoo like </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe six months ago or so,</v>

1480
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:41.490
<v Speaker 1>and they have gorillas there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get right up next to him in the</v>

1481
01:08:41.730 --> 01:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>glass and you look in and you see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around and they're,</v>

1482
01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:50.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially just a few yards </v>

1483
01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>from you just right there walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1484
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fucked up in San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara.</v>

1485
01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:58.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fucked up because you </v>

1486
01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:00.281
<v Speaker 1>really shouldn't be able to just look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gorilla because if you just look at </v>

1487
01:09:00.281 --> 01:09:00.800
<v Speaker 1>them in real life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do we figure out why this is so crammed </v>

1495
01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>he must be a south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was just because she was on her</v>

1498
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:39.940

<v Speaker 1>I think one of the largest silver back </v>

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:39.940
<v Speaker 1>500 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try that one.</v>

1501
01:09:42.951 --> 01:09:45.110

1502
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:46.280
<v Speaker 1>That's parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

1503
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Is that what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1504
01:09:47.691 --> 01:09:50.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's a crazy belly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disgusted and ashamed.</v>

1505
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that gorilla cares about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his gut?</v>

1506
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't freak them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a girl you think or a guy?</v>

1507
01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a guy that looked very </v>

1508
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:02.360
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for some reason,</v>

1509
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like maybe she was pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1510
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's probably the silver </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1512
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why the silver box going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bum rush the show.</v>

1513
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:11.450
<v Speaker 1>That is the silver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine these assholes are actually,</v>

1514
01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I say assholes with all due affection </v>
<v Speaker 1>and admiration,</v>

1515
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:18.830
<v Speaker 1>but these dudes are in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking jungle.</v>

1516
01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Just walking around with cameras in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of wild gorillas.</v>

1517
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention there a bunch of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad people in the Rwandan juggles.</v>

1518
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I think Joseph Kony hangs out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

1519
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his Hutu militia is what?</v>

1520
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:38.990
<v Speaker 1>A freaking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gorilla is super intelligent thing.</v>

1521
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly strong.</v>

1522
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Just strong eats vegetation and is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

1523
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it could just rip you apart with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and that's how it gets by.</v>

1524
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.080
<v Speaker 1>It gets by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by killing everything around it gets</v>

1525
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:59.081
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being able to kill so many things </v>

1526
01:10:59.081 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>that everybody just goes fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they nest on the ground.</v>

1527
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could,</v>

1528
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 1>if a gorilla wanted to pull himself up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

1529
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:09.731
<v Speaker 1>it would be pretty fucking easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't nest in trees and proud </v>

1530
01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:09.731
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's a great.</v>

1531
01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:11.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a pregnant girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is pregnant part of it.</v>

1532
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she looks like a female looks.</v>

1533
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.290
<v Speaker 1>She's because I'm a biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>

1534
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>she just looks less horrifically strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the male is.</v>

1535
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 1>She's more like soft and fuzzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

1536
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 1>They find out originally they used </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools.</v>

1537
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.980
<v Speaker 1>They definitely like will dig with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks to dig,</v>

1538
01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:33.170
<v Speaker 1>to get roots and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1539
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.680
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all vegetation.</v>

1540
01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all about vegetation.</v>

1541
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that they have probably figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out some sort of tool to do something </v>

1542
01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and we just make sense man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1543
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:48.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're building the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel,</v>

1544
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>constructing houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's still food to a bear.</v>

1545
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>size of that thing.</v>

1546
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hundred pounds.</v>

1547
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 1>How much do they weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot more.</v>

1548
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 1>A lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different kind of weight,</v>

1549
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no grizzly bears are ridiculous.</v>

1551
01:12:09.031 --> 01:12:14.031
<v Speaker 1>Strong animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fucking big five slash 600 pound </v>

1552
01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:18.600
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might fuck a grizzly bear up.</v>

1553
01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 1>He might smack a grizzly bear and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

1554
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear might be stupid to tangle </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this thing.</v>

1555
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Hard to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like his head was well.</v>

1556
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:29.700
<v Speaker 1>The grizzly bears are impossible to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ever seen them fight each other.</v>

1557
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:31.970
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the bear going to do it?</v>

1558
01:12:31.971 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Unless he knows the Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of.</v>

1559
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean the girls got to get behind them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and choke them with the grill.</v>

1560
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Going to do the grills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to just smack them in the head.</v>

1561
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Just pound them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite and throw them.</v>

1562
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe freak the fucking bear out into </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that this thing is way scarier </v>

1563
01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.670
<v Speaker 1>though a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1564
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but as far as if they went to the death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on how big the barriers and how </v>

1565
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 1>big the gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1566
01:12:53.461 --> 01:12:56.880
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are so fucking smart though.</v>

1567
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I would think that they would figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way.</v>

1568
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.530
<v Speaker 1>What would you fuck a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>either where they are,</v>

1569
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:07.160
<v Speaker 1>because they're wild too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason why they have those </v>

1570
01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.621
<v Speaker 1>giant canines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fight they fight other </v>

1571
01:13:09.621 --> 01:13:09.621
<v Speaker 1>gorillas.</v>

1572
01:13:09.621 --> 01:13:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of does he have like,</v>

1573
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 1>like a grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting about the </v>

1574
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 1>way grizzly bears kill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were.</v>

1575
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:21.330
<v Speaker 1>It was really kind of creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that animals that kill a </v>

1576
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 1>variety of things or animals that eat a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of things,</v>

1577
01:13:23.101 --> 01:13:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I should say a real omnivores which </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears are real.</v>

1578
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm no worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't necessarily kill things </v>

1579
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.390
<v Speaker 1>before they start eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1580
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:36.410
<v Speaker 1>They just hold them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there've been a lot of like in </v>

1581
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 1>grizzly man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the guys start getting his legs </v>

1582
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 1>eaten first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1583
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.981
<v Speaker 1>and for like seven minutes the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on lens caps on what you just </v>

1584
01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:44.520
<v Speaker 1>hearing the sound of him screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1585
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:49.730
<v Speaker 1>and her screaming and this is going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>for seven fucking eating him alive in </v>

1586
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Christ and that's how they kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat you alive.</v>

1587
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not at all they want to do is </v>

1588
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 1>hold you because there is so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

1589
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:03.650
<v Speaker 1>There is so much bigger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing has pawned my chest and </v>

1590
01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:06.810
<v Speaker 1>he's just wilson down on my quads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly your gut or your asshole,</v>

1591
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 1>they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go asshole first.</v>

1592
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that's how coyotes kill the </v>

1593
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 1>kill asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

1594
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>A deer like they've found deer that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>locked up together.</v>

1595
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like sometimes when deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1596
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I know you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will.</v>

1597
01:14:21.371 --> 01:14:26.371
<v Speaker 1>They're the men are fighting and the men</v>
<v Speaker 1>their horns because they slam heads </v>

1598
01:14:26.371 --> 01:14:31.081
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they wedged their horns </v>

1599
01:14:31.081 --> 01:14:33.841
<v Speaker 1>together in a way that they literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out and there's a video of </v>

1600
01:14:33.841 --> 01:14:38.071
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find this video of these two bucks </v>

1601
01:14:38.071 --> 01:14:40.650
<v Speaker 1>that are connected together and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them dead because it was eaten alive by </v>

1602
01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>these coyotes in the coyotes ate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole first.</v>

1603
01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:49.130
<v Speaker 1>So the whole back legs and the haunches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the assholes all torn out like they </v>

1604
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:53.881
<v Speaker 1>ate all of that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this other deer is still connected </v>

1605
01:14:53.881 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then he must have been like,</v>

1606
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 1>eat a little more please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1607
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1608
01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1609
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a video and they're,</v>

1610
01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the actual carcass is still attached to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one.</v>

1611
01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks awful.</v>

1612
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.560
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a full deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the bottom half is </v>

1613
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.860
<v Speaker 1>halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1614
01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:16.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1615
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:18.640
<v Speaker 1>I guess you start to see if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find it.</v>

1616
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the exact way it was phrased in</v>

1617
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:28.681
<v Speaker 1>the title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about a hunter's rescue.</v>

1618
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Buck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Dead,</v>

1619
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:32.950
<v Speaker 1>one alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1620
01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.780
<v Speaker 1>It might be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

1621
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:41.070
<v Speaker 1>It might be it so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell God that video looks </v>

1622
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.070
<v Speaker 1>like Shit.</v>

1623
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It was wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1624
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was like,</v>

1625
01:15:47.051 --> 01:15:49.330
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous video ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1626
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:51.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual one was these two.</v>

1627
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find it folks if you've got more</v>

1628
01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 1>time than us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

1629
01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lock horns,</v>

1630
01:15:56.111 --> 01:15:58.030
<v Speaker 1>they get stuck in the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eat them,</v>

1631
01:15:58.031 --> 01:15:59.920
<v Speaker 1>asshole first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they do it.</v>

1632
01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to turn me over and eat </v>

1633
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:06.901
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how about you going to stare and </v>

1634
01:16:06.901 --> 01:16:08.581
<v Speaker 1>your buddy's eyes while you're connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>together by the head while he's getting </v>

1635
01:16:08.581 --> 01:16:12.361
<v Speaker 1>his asshole eaten?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to wear a fucking stuck because </v>

1636
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:15.580
<v Speaker 1>coyotes never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mean they catch Fonz.</v>

1637
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.830
<v Speaker 1>They never catch a full grown buck like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1638
01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>A full grown buck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big 150 pound animal with giant Horn </v>

1639
01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>licious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coyotes are like,</v>

1640
01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>that's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1641
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.230
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you a diet already.</v>

1642
01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.420
<v Speaker 1>And then came in here because the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>one was kicking them away.</v>

1643
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's eat this.</v>

1644
01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:34.441
<v Speaker 1>End of wonder doesn't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're connected together by the </v>

1645
01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:35.540
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1646
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting point being.</v>

1647
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>This is my whole point at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all this nonsense.</v>

1648
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that the need for separateness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the need to defend yourself,</v>

1649
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:55.591
<v Speaker 1>the need to attack the need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression was all instilled and </v>

1650
01:16:56.471 --> 01:17:01.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever animal to human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately became all instilled to allow</v>

1651
01:17:01.211 --> 01:17:04.360
<v Speaker 1>it to stay alive through the darkest </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1652
01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:07.540
<v Speaker 1>the most primal times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because without that aggression,</v>

1653
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck face.</v>

1654
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:14.110
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make it to 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you remove aggression from human </v>

1655
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:15.350
<v Speaker 1>history were bare food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're coyote food.</v>

1656
01:17:15.351 --> 01:17:16.840
<v Speaker 1>We're mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food were,</v>

1657
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:22.030
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you remove the need to figure out a </v>

1658
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>way to stop the world around you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowing you up,</v>

1659
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal sovereignty and a certain </v>

1660
01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:29.410
<v Speaker 1>amount of aggression.</v>

1661
01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:32.960
<v Speaker 1>You have to fight off anything that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>

1662
01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:37.961
<v Speaker 1>Anything that has to threaten the </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival of your very species until you </v>

1663
01:17:37.961 --> 01:17:42.011
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So go from the beginning when people </v>

1664
01:17:42.011 --> 01:17:46.241
<v Speaker 1>made the first houses to figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make it gates to keep other </v>

1665
01:17:46.241 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figuring out how to,</v>

1666
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:52.180
<v Speaker 1>how to keep themselves safe from </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory animals and all those steps </v>

1667
01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 1>were like super necessary to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

1668
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do we outgrow that expression that </v>

1669
01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 1>were so dominant over all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals?</v>

1670
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:06.971
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to worry about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and the only problem we have </v>

1671
01:18:06.971 --> 01:18:09.551
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be like allocation of </v>

1672
01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:09.551
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about to say that's the big one.</v>

1673
01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.250
<v Speaker 1>You Watch how fast people devolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as there's a.</v>

1674
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a limited source of water and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going in their car or whatever,</v>

1675
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:18.320
<v Speaker 1>may not have enough water for the day.</v>

1676
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 1>That's when things get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1677
01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's all a question of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean,</v>

1678
01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:26.000
<v Speaker 1>most of most tribes that fought there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was always that situation.</v>

1679
01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 1>It was a fight over resources or water </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights or whatever it might.</v>

1680
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 1>You know that they're pioneering a new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a desalination plant in San Diego.</v>

1681
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:38.160
<v Speaker 1>They're going to spend some untold </v>
<v Speaker 1>buckets,</v>

1682
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:40.130
<v Speaker 1>a load of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1683
01:18:40.131 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>desalination plant.</v>

1684
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:48.220
<v Speaker 1>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is buy real estate </v>

1685
01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.761
<v Speaker 1>on Catalina island because it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a road that leads out to the </v>

1686
01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:51.860
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dry out the ocean.</v>

1687
01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 1>People are creeps desalinization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they figured out desalinization,</v>

1688
01:18:57.111 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to be sucking the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>off every day.</v>

1689
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:03.560
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to be pulling billions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gallons.</v>

1690
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't stop drinking out of the </v>

1691
01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be dry by 20,</v>

1692
01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>75 by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75.</v>

1693
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.160
<v Speaker 1>All the water will be in like golf </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses and bottled water facilities.</v>

1694
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:19.940
<v Speaker 1>There'll be no water in the whole ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just big dry hole.</v>

1695
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did that.</v>

1696
01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:25.961
<v Speaker 1>Went to the LLC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The LLC was the the ecological disaster.</v>

1697
01:19:26.871 --> 01:19:31.871
<v Speaker 1>That was the llc and then it dried up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and they dried up because people </v>

1698
01:19:33.051 --> 01:19:34.670
<v Speaker 1>pulled the water out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>

1699
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:38.820
<v Speaker 1>It would be a logical disaster for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reasons and apparently the algae grew</v>

1700
01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:43.821
<v Speaker 1>so much and there's too much hydrogen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water and then it is a thousand </v>

1701
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.750
<v Speaker 1>things and they were siphoning the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>off with dams and rivers and it became a</v>

1702
01:19:45.751 --> 01:19:47.560
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dried up articles,</v>

1703
01:19:47.561 --> 01:19:50.120
<v Speaker 1>see eco disaster and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1704
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:51.840
<v Speaker 1>go arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrow,</v>

1705
01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow,</v>

1706
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:58.250
<v Speaker 1>look out there and you can just see </v>
<v Speaker 1>boats that are just on dry land.</v>

1707
01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:03.251
<v Speaker 1>Huge Ocean liners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now these things like how quick does do </v>

1708
01:20:03.251 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 1>these things happen?</v>

1709
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1710
01:20:04.911 --> 01:20:05.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see dries up,</v>

1711
01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:08.650
<v Speaker 1>do they get a 10 year window?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do like,</v>

1712
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:14.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the LLC took about 40 years to </v>

1713
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.090
<v Speaker 1>dry out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at the boats out there that you</v>

1714
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 1>still see that was all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see all of it.</v>

1715
01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of mismanagement and,</v>

1716
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:24.891
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and using the water irresponsibly for </v>

1717
01:20:24.891 --> 01:20:24.891
<v Speaker 1>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so damming up parts of it,</v>

1718
01:20:24.891 --> 01:20:29.751
<v Speaker 1>running off parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally got rid of the C and </v>

1719
01:20:29.751 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the eco disaster.</v>

1720
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 1>So this was all because of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering?</v>

1721
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1722
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So that was a natural sea and human </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering lead it to dry up.</v>

1723
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1724
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also very common,</v>

1725
01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:48.501
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shortsighted thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is also fascinating because </v>

1726
01:20:48.501 --> 01:20:52.731
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of the very thing we were </v>

1727
01:20:52.731 --> 01:20:56.211
<v Speaker 1>talking about that this human animal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like figuring out all kinds of shit all </v>

1728
01:20:57.421 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 1>the time and it has the power to reshape</v>
<v Speaker 1>land now.</v>

1729
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Make areas uninhabitable with an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1730
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 1>or bring them to life with an error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1731
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.380
<v Speaker 1>The salt and sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salt and sea for like a long time,</v>

1732
01:21:13.381 --> 01:21:18.381
<v Speaker 1>like a couple of decades was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing spot where people would go on </v>

1733
01:21:18.381 --> 01:21:23.121
<v Speaker 1>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called it like California's </v>

1734
01:21:23.121 --> 01:21:26.331
<v Speaker 1>Riviera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a seed that they created by </v>

1735
01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:27.420
<v Speaker 1>opening up the Colorado River.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an accident.</v>

1736
01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.330
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1737
01:21:29.331 --> 01:21:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now it's an eco disaster to it is.</v>

1738
01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's horrifically salty and filled </v>

1739
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:42.111
<v Speaker 1>with runoff from all the agriculture all</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the state and all that shit </v>

1740
01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that's trickling down from up north and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the water systems.</v>

1741
01:21:46.891 --> 01:21:51.891
<v Speaker 1>It's going into there a lot of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting runoff from farms and getting </v>

1742
01:21:51.891 --> 01:21:52.910
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1743
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:54.270
<v Speaker 1>that's where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1744
01:21:54.271 --> 01:21:57.600
<v Speaker 1>They have millions of fish die off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt and sea.</v>

1745
01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:02.640
<v Speaker 1>That's millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Salton Sea has so many dead bones on</v>

1746
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:06.240
<v Speaker 1>its beaches that its beaches are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually dried fish bones.</v>

1747
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow is beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's entire beaches that are </v>

1748
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:14.631
<v Speaker 1>completely covered with white dead fish </v>
<v Speaker 1>bones and you're walking in it and you </v>

1749
01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 1>don't realize until you look down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gray.</v>

1750
01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:22.920
<v Speaker 1>That is all that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fish bones to see that that person's </v>

1751
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.741
<v Speaker 1>walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking footsteps in fish bones that are </v>

1752
01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:33.021
<v Speaker 1>so plentiful that they looked like sand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is still efficient.</v>

1753
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saddam Hussein was empower in Iraq.</v>

1754
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.860
<v Speaker 1>There was an area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1755
01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I think in the south of Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in their lives.</v>

1756
01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.690
<v Speaker 1>People called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called the Marsh Arabs who had been</v>

1757
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:48.770
<v Speaker 1>there for Millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he did,</v>

1758
01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.160
<v Speaker 1>he found out that a lot of Iranian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1759
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the Iranian forces were using </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as sort of a hotbed of insurgency and</v>

1760
01:22:56.761 --> 01:22:59.250
<v Speaker 1>also using it for our strategic stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Iran,</v>

1761
01:22:59.251 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war.</v>

1762
01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:05.180
<v Speaker 1>He in one of the greatest ecological </v>
<v Speaker 1>disasters ever committed by one man </v>

1763
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>drained the entire marsh and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to pictures,</v>

1764
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:13.741
<v Speaker 1>good pictures of the Marsh Arabs in Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the seventies and you'll see what it </v>

1765
01:23:13.741 --> 01:23:13.950
<v Speaker 1>looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1766
01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:16.030
<v Speaker 1>they'd been living there for thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

1767
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:21.031
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes all the way back to Alexander </v>

1768
01:23:21.031 --> 01:23:22.861
<v Speaker 1>the Great and he drained it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of less than a year and burned.</v>

1769
01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It gets back to what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about when we were,</v>

1770
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:27.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the car.</v>

1771
01:23:27.101 --> 01:23:31.240
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about hardcore history in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mongols at that,</v>

1772
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:36.241
<v Speaker 1>the way they used to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just take things that's a </v>

1773
01:23:36.241 --> 01:23:39.990
<v Speaker 1>painting though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just take things to a </v>

1774
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:44.911
<v Speaker 1>completely different level when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like aggression and psychotic </v>

1775
01:23:44.911 --> 01:23:46.780
<v Speaker 1>behavior and it becomes a total game </v>
<v Speaker 1>changer.</v>

1776
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It just like no one knows what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes hundreds of years to recover from </v>

1777
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.870
<v Speaker 1>what this person does.</v>

1778
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Say that the Middle East never really </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovered from what the Mongols did in </v>

1779
01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 slash six or 12 slash 20 or </v>

1780
01:23:59.420 --> 01:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

1781
01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the 1200 they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Iraq.</v>

1782
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.020
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the big ones at Baghdad </v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time was like one of the</v>

1783
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 1>cultural centers of the world filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with intellectuals,</v>

1784
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:13.500
<v Speaker 1>but after the Mongols came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>description was that the river ran red </v>

1785
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:17.161
<v Speaker 1>with blood and black with ink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all of these scholars who at the time</v>

1786
01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:22.621
<v Speaker 1>like people have this idea of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to history like</v>

1787
01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:27.781
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world as being just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like barbaric or very violent group </v>

1788
01:24:27.781 --> 01:24:29.730
<v Speaker 1>that's willing to kill you because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw their.</v>

1789
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Their cartoon character guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1790
01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 1>There are people like that out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are because of that that believe in</v>

1791
01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:40.090
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go back to the history of the</v>

1792
01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:45.091
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at one point in time they were at </v>

1793
01:24:45.091 --> 01:24:46.150
<v Speaker 1>the front of the line when it came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and philosophy.</v>

1794
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:51.390
<v Speaker 1>They were at the front of the line and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people argue that what the </v>

1795
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Mongols did literally changed the age of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment for them,</v>

1796
01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:55.510
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it does,</v>

1797
01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.120
<v Speaker 1>but it allowed what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese and the end,</v>

1798
01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allowed the Europeans who are </v>

1799
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:06.400
<v Speaker 1>nowhere close to as technologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced as philosophically or even as,</v>

1800
01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1801
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.550
<v Speaker 1>culturally advanced as say the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>

1802
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It allowed them to gain ground on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>China and the Middle East because of </v>

1803
01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 1>what the Mongols did to them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they destroyed in the course of,</v>

1804
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:20.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the years just destroyed that.</v>

1805
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:22.960
<v Speaker 1>The centers of their civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their infrastructure,</v>

1806
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:24.370
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their canals for,</v>

1807
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:25.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>

1808
01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 1>all of their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially their culture killed their </v>

1809
01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 1>best and their brightest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:25:31.541 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 1>it's really amazing how many people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

1811
01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.040
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1812
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 1>the number that Dan Carlin site to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around $50 million.</v>

1813
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:44.191
<v Speaker 1>They believe God the died within his </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime as a result of the decisions </v>

1814
01:25:44.191 --> 01:25:47.821
<v Speaker 1>that he made and the orders that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>carried out somewhere on 50 million </v>

1815
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:49.090
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed,</v>

1816
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he ends up,</v>

1817
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>he ends the thing with saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm say we will,</v>

1818
01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his for the force of his nature,</v>

1819
01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.620
<v Speaker 1>the strength of his nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He truly believed he was this divine </v>

1820
01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>spirit who had a mission</v>

1821
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.930
<v Speaker 3>to remake the world in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his mind's eye,</v>

1822
01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.240
<v Speaker 3>like he was the center of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything belonged to him and his </v>

1823
01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.220
<v Speaker 3>legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what a,</v>

1824
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 3>what a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a crazy way to think to begin with.</v>

1825
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that it worked and he did </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all on horseback.</v>

1826
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it all on horseback and he had an </v>

1827
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:26.230
<v Speaker 3>amazing ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one of the.</v>

1828
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:27.500
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I found most unique </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

1829
01:26:27.501 --> 01:26:32.501
<v Speaker 3>a narration by Dan Carlin was when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about how the guy would win,</v>

1830
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:35.540
<v Speaker 3>he would find people that were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented,</v>

1831
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:40.541
<v Speaker 3>that were the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would recruit them like a guy shot </v>

1832
01:26:40.541 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 3>him off of his fucking horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot his horse from under him,</v>

1833
01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:46.661
<v Speaker 3>and then he made him one of his generals</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he named him the Arrow call this Guy</v>

1834
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Chubby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chubby.</v>

1835
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:52.661
<v Speaker 3>The Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that you would take a guy </v>

1836
01:26:52.661 --> 01:26:55.241
<v Speaker 3>who tried to fucking kill you and shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>your horse out from under you and then </v>

1837
01:26:55.241 --> 01:26:55.241
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1838
01:26:55.241 --> 01:26:55.610
<v Speaker 3>you're a pretty fucking good shot.</v>

1839
01:26:55.610 --> 01:27:00.610
<v Speaker 3>You give him some knuckles and you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fucking kill everybody in the world </v>

1840
01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:04.241
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like our item in these guys know I had </v>

1841
01:27:04.241 --> 01:27:06.410
<v Speaker 3>an orgy together or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did some opium and had a good old time.</v>

1842
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He felt that he could spot talent.</v>

1843
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would take people that were.</v>

1844
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:13.130
<v Speaker 3>You would capture people and he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out.</v>

1845
01:27:13.131 --> 01:27:18.131
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any you motherfuckers have any skills </v>

1846
01:27:18.131 --> 01:27:18.131
<v Speaker 3>because if you don't have any skills I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to kill you.</v>

1847
01:27:18.131 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 3>But if you've got some skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me know what you do.</v>

1848
01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1849
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:25.270
<v Speaker 3>and people would say I'm a surgeon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>hey I don't whether even surgeons back </v>

1850
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:28.811
<v Speaker 3>then probably I could have been a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how with that you would have been </v>

1851
01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:28.811
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

1852
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:30.200
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come roll with me.</v>

1853
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:31.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>C'Mon.</v>

1854
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Survive.</v>

1855
01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to.</v>

1856
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blood.</v>

1857
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Come on when you bitches with Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just get them to see a team.</v>

1858
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:43.901
<v Speaker 3>Real quick bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they knew some shit actually need </v>

1859
01:27:43.901 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 3>to think about it like in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you think it went back as far as </v>

1860
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:48.410
<v Speaker 3>$1,200?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to have.</v>

1861
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:53.650
<v Speaker 3>It had to have been the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if much of they talked </v>

1862
01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:56.741
<v Speaker 3>about it because they were so busy </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing each other with arrows and </v>

1863
01:27:56.741 --> 01:27:57.560
<v Speaker 3>swords and shit and spears and </v>
<v Speaker 3>catapults.</v>

1864
01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the wrestling was </v>
<v Speaker 3>paramount.</v>

1865
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:04.430
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a group of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>though that that fought with their hands</v>

1866
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 3>up close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeball to eyeball.</v>

1867
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:11.350
<v Speaker 3>Did it and I'm all the guys that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about who are coming into your </v>

1868
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:14.591
<v Speaker 3>village or your town had had plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience with that in that space.</v>

1869
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 3>When you're fighting for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're really killing somebody,</v>

1870
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I'd imagine it it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different muscle.</v>

1871
01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're using very different muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using a very different mindset.</v>

1872
01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.290
<v Speaker 3>So I would imagine they had a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marshall Sense.</v>

1873
01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:30.620
<v Speaker 3>They probably were pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty good with hand to hand combat.</v>

1874
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably knew like.</v>

1875
01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about like the,</v>

1876
01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:38.300
<v Speaker 3>the early days of martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was most certainly a lot of faulty</v>

1877
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:42.620
<v Speaker 3>technique and faulty ideas that they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>not taken the most,</v>

1878
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:47.750
<v Speaker 3>the most effortless path or the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>technical path.</v>

1879
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:49.420
<v Speaker 3>They hadn't figured it out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

1880
01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:54.660
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly some evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates that because by the time we </v>

1881
01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 3>got like the highest versions of martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts in like the fifties and the sixties</v>

1882
01:28:57.861 --> 01:29:02.861
<v Speaker 3>and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really compare some of the top </v>

1883
01:29:02.861 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 3>guys to like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's possible today.</v>

1884
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's evolved like many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1885
01:29:06.601 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1886
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

1887
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:08.250
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

1888
01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:08.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1889
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:11.980
<v Speaker 3>So I think Hector Lombard me down on any</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Mongols,</v>

1903
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:54.150

<v Speaker 3>Real brutality of boxing.</v>

01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After 12 arounds of.</v>

1911
01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>

1912
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:10.970
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:11.820
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took.</v>

1914
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:16.870
<v Speaker 3>How about that fight with Bradley?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the craziest one I've ever seen </v>

1915
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.890
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing fight and I think that uh,</v>

1916
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 3>that the genetics that come from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>area from Siberia and from the step and </v>

1917
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Mongols and the genetics of survivors of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years,</v>

1918
01:30:31.831 --> 01:30:36.831
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years of oppression and war</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like almost a distillation of </v>

1919
01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:41.630
<v Speaker 3>like the strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strongest survive just to be born and </v>

1920
01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:45.681
<v Speaker 3>lived to maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't like that because it seems </v>

1921
01:30:45.681 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 3>to like to indicate some sort of cruelty</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nature,</v>

1922
01:30:46.381 --> 01:30:51.381
<v Speaker 3>but I think to really not be objective </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it is real cruelty because then </v>

1923
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not,</v>

1924
01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:54.990
<v Speaker 3>if you're not expressing it for what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>really is,</v>

1925
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:55.250
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1926
01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 3>You're not seeing it for what it really </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and expressing it in an honest way.</v>

1927
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:02.040
<v Speaker 3>If you're expressing it through an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>

1928
01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you doing everybody a massive disservice</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's pretty obvious that </v>

1929
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:10.770
<v Speaker 3>aggression was necessary and beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get us to here.</v>

1930
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody recognizing that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>help the idea of like,</v>

1931
01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:21.081
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if we really did need to do certain </v>

1932
01:31:21.081 --> 01:31:24.110
<v Speaker 3>military actions in order to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain psychos from,</v>

1933
01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:29.170
<v Speaker 3>from growing and marching forward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking over giant chunks of land just </v>

1934
01:31:29.170 --> 01:31:33.261
<v Speaker 3>like they have throughout the Mongol </v>
<v Speaker 3>days and this person and Filipinos and </v>

1935
01:31:33.261 --> 01:31:37.130
<v Speaker 3>the grain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always been someone that does </v>

1936
01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:37.130
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1937
01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:39.710
<v Speaker 3>So you need some sort of defense to hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>that off or we agreed and then anybody </v>

1938
01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:44.151
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've got a real Koombaya problem </v>

1939
01:31:44.151 --> 01:31:44.151
<v Speaker 3>because he got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1940
01:31:44.151 --> 01:31:46.050
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen really crazy people?</v>

1941
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been around someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to kill you for money,</v>

1942
01:31:49.711 --> 01:31:51.990
<v Speaker 3>for fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for women,</v>

1943
01:31:51.991 --> 01:31:54.300
<v Speaker 3>for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for your water?</v>

1944
01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Water rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

1945
01:31:55.691 --> 01:31:58.470
<v Speaker 3>There's people out there that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing by the rules.</v>

1946
01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:00.200
<v Speaker 3>You're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did you grow up?</v>

1947
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Pasadena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great place.</v>

1948
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Pasadena is a great plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Tar tar steps.</v>

1949
01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not Istanbul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck.</v>

1950
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not in the middle of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on the middle of Baghdad in a place</v>

1951
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:16.051
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't even have a roof anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the soldiers blew it off with </v>

1952
01:32:16.051 --> 01:32:17.440
<v Speaker 3>their robot flying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No changes you.</v>

1953
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it does.</v>

1954
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:24.151
<v Speaker 3>Of course it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anybody that doesn't think you need </v>

1955
01:32:24.151 --> 01:32:24.850
<v Speaker 3>some sort of military force until that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is all eradicated.</v>

1956
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:30.030
<v Speaker 3>So that becomes the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to figure out how do you </v>

1957
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 3>eradicate all the shitty pockets of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>on earth.</v>

1958
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.730
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean like eradicate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>peep.</v>

1959
01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean eradicate the problems that make </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people shitty and that seems to be</v>

1960
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:38.620
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>

1961
01:32:38.630 --> 01:32:42.130
<v Speaker 3>you have to eradicate the problems and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way a country,</v>

1962
01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 3>the institutions that that give rise to </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil people.</v>

1963
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:50.941
<v Speaker 3>If you have a society that's structured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have institutions that are </v>

1964
01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 3>structured so that the only way to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead is if you're a bad.</v>

1965
01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:58.650
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're an amoral motherfucker that </v>

1966
01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:00.250
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to have people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>gang gangs con at all.</v>

1967
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Rise to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1968
01:33:02.531 --> 01:33:05.140
<v Speaker 3>It's the way society is structured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1969
01:33:05.141 --> 01:33:07.360
<v Speaker 3>they always talk about we have to cure </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty or whatever.</v>

1970
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:10.390
<v Speaker 3>The United States is powerful because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>its strength of institution.</v>

1971
01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:15.900
<v Speaker 3>It's powerful because we have courts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that mean something because we have </v>

1972
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:19.801
<v Speaker 3>property rights where you own a house </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you actually are secure as an </v>

1973
01:33:19.801 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 3>American that somebody's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come in and take your house.</v>

1974
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Very few countries share that luxury </v>
<v Speaker 3>today in 2015 and courts that are </v>

1975
01:33:26.981 --> 01:33:29.410
<v Speaker 3>objective that just because you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of money,</v>

1976
01:33:29.411 --> 01:33:31.090
<v Speaker 3>and I know this is there exceptions to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1977
01:33:31.091 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 3>but just because you have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

1978
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:34.180
<v Speaker 3>you're getting off for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1979
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.420
<v Speaker 3>we have courts where if you have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of money and you kill somebody and you </v>

1980
01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:39.420
<v Speaker 3>get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have big problems.</v>

1981
01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're a cop and you're caught on </v>
<v Speaker 3>video shooting,</v>

1982
01:33:40.871 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 3>somebody you have big problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cops don't have a lot of money,</v>

1983
01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:45.940
<v Speaker 3>but rich people have been able to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>finagle systems,</v>

1984
01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:51.180
<v Speaker 3>good lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a problem and it certainly is a </v>

1985
01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.701
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not to the extent that it is in so </v>

1986
01:33:53.701 --> 01:33:55.591
<v Speaker 3>many other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The corruption is not as blatant as it </v>

1987
01:33:55.591 --> 01:33:55.870
<v Speaker 3>is in so many other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no denying that.</v>

1988
01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I think the real question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1989
01:33:58.190 --> 01:34:03.190
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of one of the customary actions that </v>

1990
01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:03.190
<v Speaker 3>we've taken.</v>

1991
01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Because W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I mean by that is if you look at </v>

1992
01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 3>people from where we are right now at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 21st century,</v>

1993
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:15.030
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you consider what people were like </v>

1994
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 3>just maybe a 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago,</v>

1995
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:23.700
<v Speaker 3>like there's never really been a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people have had this method of </v>

1996
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:27.910
<v Speaker 3>communicating with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we used to,</v>

1997
01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:33.180
<v Speaker 3>we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only do we not know what was going </v>

1998
01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:33.180
<v Speaker 3>on in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had no connection to it.</v>

1999
01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:38.010
<v Speaker 3>You would read some stuff on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy from Japan and what's a </v>

2000
01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:41.071
<v Speaker 3>fuck us up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy and you would have no </v>

2001
01:34:41.071 --> 01:34:44.430
<v Speaker 3>connection to those people and you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew there's a people over there just </v>

2002
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 3>just like Lord of the rings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2003
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank.</v>

2004
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Any war movie from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2005
01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:52.590
<v Speaker 3>the mon goals to whatever the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2006
01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 3>this idea that you would have this group</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that was waiting to come over </v>

2007
01:34:57.710 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 3>and fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

2008
01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2009
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Because there's satellites everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see everything.</v>

2010
01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:05.240
<v Speaker 2>We send information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

2011
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But this has all happened inside of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime,</v>

2012
01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:12.320
<v Speaker 2>so there's been a change that's taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>place that I don't think we're really </v>

2013
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 2>fully aware of yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this weird connection thing that</v>

2014
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:20.351
<v Speaker 2>we have to literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody on the world will also </v>

2015
01:35:20.351 --> 01:35:23.111
<v Speaker 2>remember that when you had an enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even as far as even in World War II with</v>

2016
01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.020
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you did was you got your</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers to believe that,</v>

2017
01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:29.840
<v Speaker 2>that that enemy they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were subhuman,</v>

2018
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 2>they weren't human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were subhuman and you see it over </v>

2019
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2020
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:37.520
<v Speaker 2>that's becoming harder and harder to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Carlin not to bring it back to him,</v>

2021
01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:42.521
<v Speaker 2>was also talking about how when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought them enemy in world war one and </v>

2022
01:35:42.521 --> 01:35:46.961
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encountered your first line of </v>

2023
01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:46.961
<v Speaker 2>Germans or whatever.</v>

2024
01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:49.970
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know how far back that line </v>
<v Speaker 2>went.</v>

2025
01:35:49.971 --> 01:35:53.930
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know if there are a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them or if there were 100,000</v>

2026
01:35:53.931 --> 01:35:58.931
<v Speaker 2>or 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just fought sort of not knowing </v>

2027
01:35:58.931 --> 01:36:00.500
<v Speaker 2>to not only the effect you're having on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2028
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:05.830
<v Speaker 2>on their forward momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also on their general population to </v>

2029
01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:11.561
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were fighting and when they </v>

2030
01:36:11.561 --> 01:36:11.561
<v Speaker 2>stopped fighting it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you find out,</v>

2031
01:36:11.561 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a million of them.</v>

2032
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:14.960
<v Speaker 2>We just fought these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just think about that.</v>

2033
01:36:14.961 --> 01:36:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Now we know where their regiments are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how far back they go.</v>

2034
01:36:17.961 --> 01:36:19.550
<v Speaker 2>We know exactly how many people there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2035
01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:22.460
<v Speaker 2>We can plan accordingly and not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can talk to each other.</v>

2036
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:27.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what was missing was missing was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only people that are talking to each</v>

2037
01:36:27.561 --> 01:36:32.561
<v Speaker 2>other with generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The generals and presidents were like </v>

2038
01:36:32.561 --> 01:36:32.690
<v Speaker 2>the only people talking to each other.</v>

2039
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Listen Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna fuck you up.</v>

2040
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fuck you up for God,</v>

2041
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's on our side.</v>

2042
01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And wars would start because of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliances and they would just,</v>

2043
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:41.630
<v Speaker 2>they would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2044
01:36:41.631 --> 01:36:46.631
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fight and break this </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance and then you'd find out about </v>

2045
01:36:46.631 --> 01:36:46.631
<v Speaker 2>it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a citizen,</v>

2046
01:36:46.631 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm farming my land.</v>

2047
01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:47.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2048
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:51.650
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck that Japanese got together </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Germans and the Italians.</v>

2049
01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.510
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which war?</v>

2050
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.040
<v Speaker 2>World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like would it be.</v>

2051
01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how it happened,</v>

2052
01:36:56.361 --> 01:36:59.420
<v Speaker 2>but how the fuck if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities of the different groups of</v>

2053
01:36:59.421 --> 01:37:04.421
<v Speaker 2>people and the languages they speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>three completely different fucking </v>

2054
01:37:04.421 --> 01:37:04.850
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three complete,</v>

2055
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:10.090
<v Speaker 2>completely different types of people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all their dictated had a lot of trade </v>

2056
01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:10.280
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2057
01:37:10.281 --> 01:37:12.740
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that the Germans,</v>

2058
01:37:12.741 --> 01:37:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler wanted to create an access,</v>

2059
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:21.070
<v Speaker 2>sort of an access to a sort of a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world order and he had a great deal of </v>

2060
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 2>respect for the Japanese.</v>

2061
01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:24.380
<v Speaker 2>He considered the Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ariens of the east,</v>

2062
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:29.010
<v Speaker 2>and he had enormous respect for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British really areas of the.</v>

2063
01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 2>He loved their yellow fever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Szeto,</v>

2064
01:37:32.091 --> 01:37:34.160
<v Speaker 2>which was the idea that way of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>

2065
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Japan had been in a low grade war for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civil war for really a thousand years.</v>

2066
01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:44.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just constant battles between </v>

2067
01:37:44.771 --> 01:37:44.771
<v Speaker 2>Laura feudal shoguns like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2068
01:37:44.771 --> 01:37:47.000
<v Speaker 2>these fiefdoms shogun would run </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiefdoms.</v>

2069
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:49.490
<v Speaker 2>He'd hire mercenaries and they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fight for land.</v>

2070
01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.700
<v Speaker 2>And that went on for a really 310 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a thousand.</v>

2071
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 2>That's why the swordsman and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability,</v>

2072
01:37:58.021 --> 01:38:03.021
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were legendary archers and they </v>

2073
01:38:03.021 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>were just legendary and ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2074
01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:06.660
<v Speaker 2>when the Portuguese were trading with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2075
01:38:06.661 --> 01:38:11.661
<v Speaker 2>they came back and the first thing they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said to their European rulers is they </v>

2076
01:38:11.661 --> 01:38:11.661
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2077
01:38:11.661 --> 01:38:16.520
<v Speaker 2>couple things you don't want them doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning how to sail long distances and </v>

2078
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:19.350
<v Speaker 2>learning about a little something we </v>
<v Speaker 2>call gunpowder.</v>

2079
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't give them gunpowder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are straight up the most ferocious </v>

2080
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:25.800
<v Speaker 2>group of motherfuckers on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're late for something,</v>

2081
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:30.950
<v Speaker 2>they immediately request to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because they've dishonored </v>

2082
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.950
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2083
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:32.940
<v Speaker 2>their fanatical to authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2084
01:38:32.941 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2085
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.760
<v Speaker 2>that Plu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tiny island took up,</v>

2086
01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:38.570
<v Speaker 2>took over a great deal of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2087
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:39.210
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2088
01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.240
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were insanely warlike and </v>

2089
01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:44.240
<v Speaker 2>impossibly disciplined</v>

2090
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:48.500
<v Speaker 3>and their version of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this day is being taught.</v>

2091
01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you understand all the,</v>

2092
01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:54.050
<v Speaker 3>like Leo Machida who lost this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still,</v>

2093
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great all time fighter and he's an </v>

2094
01:38:59.240 --> 01:38:59.270
<v Speaker 3>amazing martial artist and his styles </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed,</v>

2095
01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>con based.</v>

2096
01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It's based on that style is another two </v>
<v Speaker 3>dozen Japanese mentioned.</v>

2097
01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:08.720
<v Speaker 3>So really Jujitsu is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Brazilian Jujitsu was modified by</v>

2098
01:39:08.721 --> 01:39:11.530
<v Speaker 3>the gracies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modified by Helio and,</v>

2099
01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:16.570
<v Speaker 3>and Carlos Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they modified it in turned Jujitsu into </v>

2100
01:39:16.570 --> 01:39:21.431
<v Speaker 3>what it would ultimately become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They spent much more time on the ground </v>

2101
01:39:21.431 --> 01:39:24.701
<v Speaker 3>fighting then the judoka cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of the judo cause even like a </v>

2102
01:39:24.701 --> 01:39:28.391
<v Speaker 3>lot of their techniques came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an infusion of techniques </v>

2103
01:39:28.391 --> 01:39:33.041
<v Speaker 3>where there's some sort of a blurry </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossroads between catch wrestling and </v>

2104
01:39:33.041 --> 01:39:35.840
<v Speaker 3>judo and some catch wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm also taught in Japan,</v>

2105
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:41.050
<v Speaker 3>like Karl gotch and Billy Robinson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys taught a lot of people in </v>

2106
01:39:41.050 --> 01:39:44.681
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Sakharova was a student of catch </v>

2107
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:44.681
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>

2108
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:45.090
<v Speaker 3>And so he imparted that like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2109
01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:50.100
<v Speaker 3>a lot of catch wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>submission holds that style of </v>

2110
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:54.341
<v Speaker 3>attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He incorporated that in a lot of MMA </v>

2111
01:39:54.341 --> 01:39:55.190
<v Speaker 3>fights and started a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just in Japan but all over the world</v>

2112
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:57.590
<v Speaker 3>fighting that style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's like,</v>

2113
01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:02.480
<v Speaker 3>there's many different versions of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan has brought out to the rest of the</v>

2114
01:40:02.481 --> 01:40:04.010
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many different versions.</v>

2115
01:40:04.011 --> 01:40:08.240
<v Speaker 3>But as far as like martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the biggest contributors.</v>

2116
01:40:08.241 --> 01:40:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Like ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just figured out I quito,</v>

2117
01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:16.540
<v Speaker 3>they figured out judo that figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and figured out submissions in a</v>

2118
01:40:16.581 --> 01:40:20.270
<v Speaker 3>way that you really can't find parallel </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time.</v>

2119
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that the Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 3>better now than ever before and I think </v>

2120
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I credit that to the Brazilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I credit that to the gracies in Brazil </v>

2121
01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:33.701
<v Speaker 3>to this day still has a huge number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>super high level Jujitsu guys worldwide.</v>

2122
01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:37.490
<v Speaker 3>It's evening out way more than it ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>has before,</v>

2123
01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.640
<v Speaker 3>but I mean just the overall output and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the origins of it in the fact that it's </v>

2124
01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.250
<v Speaker 3>still called Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody calls a Bjj for a reason.</v>

2125
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2126
01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:45.460
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2127
01:40:45.461 --> 01:40:50.461
<v Speaker 3>they deserve all the credit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's still guys like Jocko </v>

2128
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:53.311
<v Speaker 3>ray with jock already did this weekend </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Chris Kamozi that armbar setup that </v>

2129
01:40:53.311 --> 01:40:54.380
<v Speaker 3>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's such a hero magician,</v>

2130
01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:55.510
<v Speaker 3>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>artistic.</v>

2131
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the most spectacular forms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2132
01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 3>of like a submission of applying a </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission in a scramble that I've ever </v>

2133
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

2134
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.440
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that he's doing.</v>

2135
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2136
01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.160
<v Speaker 3>how do you defend against that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't defend against that.</v>

2137
01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:14.230
<v Speaker 3>He's an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to put it on my twitter </v>

2138
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:14.500
<v Speaker 3>feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll re a retweet it earlier today,</v>

2139
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.670
<v Speaker 3>but I think grappling world on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the ones who put it up.</v>

2140
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:19.940
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2141
01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 3>they put up a little 15 second gif.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it is.</v>

2142
01:41:24.731 --> 01:41:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is on instagram and you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch it.</v>

2143
01:41:27.161 --> 01:41:28.060
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

2144
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:30.460
<v Speaker 3>He's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so God damn good.</v>

2145
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:35.461
<v Speaker 3>It makes you wonder though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with the Japanese going back to </v>

2146
01:41:35.461 --> 01:41:36.910
<v Speaker 3>them how good they were at as swordsmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they could've done.</v>

2147
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:38.740
<v Speaker 3>The Samurai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's again,</v>

2148
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:40.630
<v Speaker 3>I think what we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Mongols like,</v>

2149
01:41:40.631 --> 01:41:45.631
<v Speaker 3>they spent so much time on weapons </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's how you fought most of </v>

2150
01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:50.881
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much time are they really </v>

2151
01:41:50.881 --> 01:41:50.881
<v Speaker 3>spending on learning how to kick people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face?</v>

2152
01:41:50.881 --> 01:41:55.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like a lot of what we </v>

2153
01:41:55.191 --> 01:41:58.531
<v Speaker 3>think about the way people used to kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and punch and it's based on movie </v>

2154
01:41:58.531 --> 01:42:03.151
<v Speaker 3>depictions of it and in movies like </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter the dragon or in these kind of </v>

2155
01:42:03.151 --> 01:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>crazy movies there.</v>

2156
01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:05.860
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to do the most impressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff so they're throwing.</v>

2157
01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:10.861
<v Speaker 3>We'll kicks and jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roundhouse kicks and jumping side kicks </v>

2158
01:42:10.861 --> 01:42:14.670
<v Speaker 3>butt in real combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Bruce Lee wrote very extensively </v>

2159
01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:17.851
<v Speaker 3>about real combat situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was always like completely </v>

2160
01:42:17.851 --> 01:42:21.490
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by the concept of utilizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimum effort,</v>

2161
01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.970
<v Speaker 3>incorporating all the best techniques </v>
<v Speaker 3>from all different martial arts and only</v>

2162
01:42:24.971 --> 01:42:28.000
<v Speaker 3>doing what's effective in discarding </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's useless.</v>

2163
01:42:28.001 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2164
01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.770
<v Speaker 3>the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe he wrote like </v>
<v Speaker 3>extensively,</v>

2165
01:42:32.771 --> 01:42:37.771
<v Speaker 3>but all sorts of different martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>even like lifted whole packages like </v>

2166
01:42:37.771 --> 01:42:41.701
<v Speaker 3>paragraphs from other martial arts books</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put them in there and people will </v>

2167
01:42:41.701 --> 01:42:41.701
<v Speaker 3>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2168
01:42:41.701 --> 01:42:41.701
<v Speaker 3>he's plagiarizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2169
01:42:41.701 --> 01:42:41.701
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2170
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:44.080
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what he was doing was collecting</v>

2171
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:49.081
<v Speaker 3>all the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now whether he attributed it to this </v>

2172
01:42:49.081 --> 01:42:49.200
<v Speaker 3>book or it should have or I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2173
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I agree intellectually probably it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most honest thing to do.</v>

2174
01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.940
<v Speaker 3>To not credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he did credit,</v>

2175
01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 3>but my point is what his art was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was absorbing everything.</v>

2176
01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:04.411
<v Speaker 3>He didn't invent any new techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he did was he took the best </v>

2177
01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:08.461
<v Speaker 3>stuff out of everywhere and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporated a system based on his </v>

2178
01:43:08.461 --> 01:43:12.841
<v Speaker 3>knowledge at the time who took in judo </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Jean lift arm bars and I don't like</v>

2179
01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:16.180
<v Speaker 3>the way you're talking about him in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past tense.</v>

2180
01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:18.920
<v Speaker 3>He suggested there's dead person's dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>

2181
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I guess you haven't read the secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of a lot of these.</v>

2182
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point was that like that guy,</v>

2183
01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:30.920
<v Speaker 3>what he had done is really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2184
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:36.060
<v Speaker 3>not just unprecedented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was like the first big blip of </v>

2185
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:41.161
<v Speaker 3>this new concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new concept of just do what you </v>

2186
01:43:41.161 --> 01:43:41.950
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was possible and do what's useful.</v>

2187
01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else before was in a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the shadow con karate tribe.</v>

2188
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:47.560
<v Speaker 3>You're in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2189
01:43:47.561 --> 01:43:52.561
<v Speaker 3>Gung Fu tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's in the judo tribe and there </v>

2190
01:43:52.561 --> 01:43:53.540
<v Speaker 3>was very little exchanging of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

2191
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:54.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2192
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I only started exchanging information </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got started getting involved in </v>

2193
01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:00.470
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing because I didn't have good </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing technique,</v>

2194
01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:05.650
<v Speaker 3>so I started working at a boxing gym and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I started hanging out with a dude </v>

2195
01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:08.230
<v Speaker 3>who's doing some Moitai as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I started learning about like </v>

2196
01:44:08.230 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 3>leg kicks and all these different things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I remember thinking,</v>

2197
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.490
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so wrong.</v>

2198
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Like the camp of taekwondo was good for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of things,</v>

2199
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.150
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't good for any of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things these guys were doing to me.</v>

2200
01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:16.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dammit,</v>

2201
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:22.300
<v Speaker 3>there's some holes in this motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the only way you would find </v>

2202
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:25.451
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way you would find out is by </v>

2203
01:44:25.451 --> 01:44:25.451
<v Speaker 3>exploring these other martial arts.</v>

2204
01:44:25.451 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>But until Bruce Lee came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was taboo.</v>

2205
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:30.890
<v Speaker 3>You were a trader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you went to a different gym to train,</v>

2206
01:44:30.891 --> 01:44:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you are a fucking trader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2207
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 3>I remember having been a wrestler and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I went to Iowa,</v>

2208
01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Dan Gables camp for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was two weeks.</v>

2209
01:44:38.511 --> 01:44:41.670
<v Speaker 3>It was a nightmare and three weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2210
01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:45.620
<v Speaker 3>and I got to wrestle with some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those Ncaa like Jim's Alaska,</v>

2211
01:44:45.621 --> 01:44:46.090
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2212
01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:50.700
<v Speaker 3>those hawkeyes as like as a 17 year old </v>
<v Speaker 3>and having wrestled I,</v>

2213
01:44:50.710 --> 01:44:55.710
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I had a real appreciation for </v>

2214
01:44:55.710 --> 01:44:55.880
<v Speaker 3>what are really good [inaudible] college</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler was about,</v>

2215
01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:59.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not because not because I ever.</v>

2216
01:44:59.121 --> 01:45:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I rolled around with those guys but not </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was just hit,</v>

2217
01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:03.560
<v Speaker 3>they were teaching us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I knew,</v>

2218
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:08.561
<v Speaker 3>I knew what tough high school wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like and then to think about don </v>

2219
01:45:08.561 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers and then I started taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo when I went to Washington dc </v>

2220
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.520
<v Speaker 3>and I say someone of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

2221
01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:18.580
<v Speaker 3>just know that if you're in a bar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a dude with closed up here and </v>

2222
01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:20.270
<v Speaker 3>he looks like he wrestled in college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the guy to be afraid of it.</v>

2223
01:45:20.290 --> 01:45:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buy Him a beer man.</v>

2224
01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Buy Him a beer because even if you punch</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2225
01:45:24.850 --> 01:45:25.460
<v Speaker 3>punch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2226
01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:27.260
<v Speaker 3>I may have gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love knowing.</v>

2227
01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:32.261
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if my kicks are going to </v>

2228
01:45:32.261 --> 01:45:32.261
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to do with it.</v>

2229
01:45:32.261 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 3>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of what we're talking about.</v>

2230
01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:37.541
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about the Mongols were </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mongols lived this life of constant </v>

2231
01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:42.611
<v Speaker 3>strain and effort and they were so </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong and the strong survive anyway,</v>

2232
01:45:44.311 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 3>like as far as like how many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in tents?</v>

2233
01:45:46.521 --> 01:45:51.521
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these motherfuckers were constantly at </v>

2234
01:45:51.521 --> 01:45:51.590
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure their genes that with what they</v>

2235
01:45:51.591 --> 01:45:56.591
<v Speaker 3>had was warrior genetics and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people when they encountered regular </v>

2236
01:45:56.991 --> 01:46:00.470
<v Speaker 3>soft people that lived inside these </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities like they were,</v>

2237
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:02.720
<v Speaker 3>they were like predators to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

2238
01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.680
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had disdain for these people,</v>

2239
01:46:04.681 --> 01:46:09.681
<v Speaker 3>like they were sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they were cattle because they were </v>

2240
01:46:09.681 --> 01:46:09.681
<v Speaker 3>so fucking strong.</v>

2241
01:46:09.681 --> 01:46:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with a guy who's </v>

2242
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.310
<v Speaker 3>goddamn amateur wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a serious competitive amateur wrestler,</v>

2243
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:17.020
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with acute has probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>been wrestling since he was a bay.</v>

2244
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.500
<v Speaker 3>It's all reaction for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's reaction.</v>

2245
01:46:19.501 --> 01:46:24.501
<v Speaker 3>Not only that his body has developed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing bodies around dented and much </v>

2246
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:29.380
<v Speaker 3>like you can't understand what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lock up with that gorilla you.</v>

2247
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:33.980
<v Speaker 3>You can understand how much stronger a </v>
<v Speaker 3>division one wrestler is the new.</v>

2248
01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.320
<v Speaker 3>You really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2249
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Like you really probably have no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you ever wrestled with one of </v>

2250
01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.240
<v Speaker 3>those dudes and it has them grab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab them,</v>

2251
01:46:41.241 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 3>grab a hold your wrists and pin you down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2252
01:46:43.810 --> 01:46:45.860
<v Speaker 3>and get out of submissions like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

2253
01:46:45.861 --> 01:46:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Or you feel their posture power there </v>
<v Speaker 3>like several times stronger than times.</v>

2254
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:52.920
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a guy who's like,</v>

2255
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example,</v>

2256
01:46:54.690 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Habib Neuroma gamete off.</v>

2257
01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker's a world samba </v>

2258
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:01.520
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of wrestling,</v>

2259
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.870
<v Speaker 3>but the point is he uses all wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch him fight,</v>

2260
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:08.460
<v Speaker 3>he's a relentless grappler and when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a hold of dudes,</v>

2261
01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.600
<v Speaker 3>they were shocked at how fucking strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>I rewatched that does Tanya's fight and </v>

2262
01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.471
<v Speaker 3>the way he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science is a monster monster and he </v>

2263
01:47:18.471 --> 01:47:18.471
<v Speaker 3>was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like a,</v>

2264
01:47:18.471 --> 01:47:20.250
<v Speaker 3>like an octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a fucking,</v>

2265
01:47:20.251 --> 01:47:22.590
<v Speaker 3>just wouldn't get off his back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a motherfucker to it.</v>

2266
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Any motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody like that.</v>

2267
01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:26.130
<v Speaker 3>He motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody liked.</v>

2268
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm so excited about this fight with </v>
<v Speaker 3>cowboy because I really want to see what</v>

2269
01:47:30.211 --> 01:47:35.211
<v Speaker 3>cowboy does to stop him and I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to see how he does with cowboy </v>

2270
01:47:35.211 --> 01:47:39.530
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cowboy on top because cowboys guard is </v>

2271
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.530
<v Speaker 3>fucking nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2272
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we've ever seen anybody </v>

2273
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.411
<v Speaker 3>threatened Habib with any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission attempts before and I wonder </v>

2274
01:47:45.411 --> 01:47:47.070
<v Speaker 3>what would happen in Dos Anjos didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a chance man,</v>

2275
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:49.380
<v Speaker 3>but dos Anjos has never been like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guard player.</v>

2276
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:51.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a big time guard player is more</v>

2277
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:53.220
<v Speaker 3>of a top smash you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2278
01:47:53.221 --> 01:47:55.620
<v Speaker 3>he's really good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so God damn good.</v>

2279
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Like what he did to pettis was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2280
01:47:58.530 --> 01:48:01.650
<v Speaker 3>that mother strong too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's strong.</v>

2281
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with Donald and cubby.</v>

2282
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2283
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I think Donald has better hands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

2284
01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he definitely does.</v>

2285
01:48:09.541 --> 01:48:11.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely is a better striker,</v>

2286
01:48:11.071 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 3>but Habib is just so much stronger when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes to grappling.</v>

2287
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:20.390
<v Speaker 3>But Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike the other guys is dangerous off </v>

2288
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:21.620
<v Speaker 3>his back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald has a nasty triangle.</v>

2289
01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Sounds throws down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes he is.</v>

2290
01:48:23.221 --> 01:48:25.740
<v Speaker 3>He's a long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got an awesome check.</v>

2291
01:48:25.741 --> 01:48:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The body throws that check knee with the</v>

2292
01:48:27.481 --> 01:48:29.430
<v Speaker 3>left side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucks guys up and he,</v>

2293
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 3>he mirrors it a lot of times or hides it</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind punches.</v>

2294
01:48:32.610 --> 01:48:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Like Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see,</v>

2295
01:48:33.631 --> 01:48:36.210
<v Speaker 3>we'll throw punches where he's not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>intended to hit you.</v>

2296
01:48:36.450 --> 01:48:40.280
<v Speaker 3>He just getting you look at these and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of moving in and then boom,</v>

2297
01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:43.260
<v Speaker 3>that need comes to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucks guys up with that.</v>

2298
01:48:43.261 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 3>He's putting on a show for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manage dancing like a cobra.</v>

2299
01:48:46.230 --> 01:48:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Know he hides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks behind punches like he did that </v>

2300
01:48:51.230 --> 01:48:51.230
<v Speaker 3>when he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2301
01:48:51.230 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Jim Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed him the right hand and boom,</v>

2302
01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 3>the net kick was right behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2303
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:59.280
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at that right hand and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his fucking neck kit comes along,</v>

2304
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your legs go out.</v>

2305
01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:04.110
<v Speaker 3>He's a cubby and this is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2306
01:49:04.111 --> 01:49:09.111
<v Speaker 3>He's a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers Donald's a motherfucker </v>

2307
01:49:09.111 --> 01:49:13.011
<v Speaker 3>and Habib's a motherfucker that isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mate that could be easily a world </v>

2308
01:49:13.011 --> 01:49:15.120
<v Speaker 3>championship fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easily world championship caliber</v>

2309
01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:20.121
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked him about conor mcgregor and </v>

2310
01:49:20.121 --> 01:49:22.821
<v Speaker 3>caboose is a very good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he wants to come to one of the </v>

2311
01:49:22.821 --> 01:49:24.210
<v Speaker 3>55,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his welcome.</v>

2312
01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I make him welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swell job keeping that guy off you.</v>

2313
01:49:31.281 --> 01:49:32.780
<v Speaker 3>If you're supposed to be fighting 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds lighter,</v>

2314
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you don't.</v>

2315
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.180
<v Speaker 3>If you're not arrested first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2316
01:49:36.181 --> 01:49:37.180
<v Speaker 3>well you listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

2317
01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that connor can't fight </v>

2318
01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.301
<v Speaker 3>at 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would say that if he's competing </v>

2319
01:49:44.301 --> 01:49:44.301
<v Speaker 3>successfully at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at 1:55,</v>

2320
01:49:44.301 --> 01:49:45.240
<v Speaker 3>45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he is right now,</v>

2321
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 3>the transition time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless he's some Mexicans supplements,</v>

2322
01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:50.870
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be a long transition time </v>
<v Speaker 3>to put on the,</v>

2323
01:49:50.871 --> 01:49:53.590
<v Speaker 3>the right amount of weight to compete at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that level.</v>

2324
01:49:53.591 --> 01:49:54.660
<v Speaker 3>World of difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2325
01:49:54.730 --> 01:49:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's pretty elite at 1:45</v>

2326
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.170
<v Speaker 3>in his movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his endurance,</v>

2327
01:49:59.171 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 3>like he's not having any problems and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>hasn't.</v>

2328
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Granted he hasn't been in a real war and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what everybody really wants to </v>

2329
01:50:06.810 --> 01:50:10.081
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody really wants to see him </v>

2330
01:50:10.081 --> 01:50:10.300
<v Speaker 3>against a wrestler because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen is tried to stand up with him</v>

2331
01:50:10.301 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 3>and he's got nasty hands man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty power,</v>

2332
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:14.980
<v Speaker 3>nasty accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super,</v>

2333
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:20.010
<v Speaker 3>super aggressive with his striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>disdainful almost with his stance and </v>

2334
01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 3>his movement towards you.</v>

2335
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:25.950
<v Speaker 3>It's shocking his confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that fucks with a lot of </v>

2336
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.950
<v Speaker 3>people's heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2337
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:29.970
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people when he comes at you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been talking shit about you for </v>

2338
01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:30.700
<v Speaker 3>months already made you feel like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole,</v>

2339
01:50:30.701 --> 01:50:32.980
<v Speaker 3>you can't give you the courage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2340
01:50:32.981 --> 01:50:37.981
<v Speaker 3>everybody's thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then by the time you get in there </v>

2341
01:50:37.981 --> 01:50:38.950
<v Speaker 3>like you've suffered a mental beating </v>
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>

2342
01:50:38.951 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 3>whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

2343
01:50:40.730 --> 01:50:41.920
<v Speaker 3>you're at a deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2344
01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.080
<v Speaker 3>I asked him where his confidence comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

2345
01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.700
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you like,</v>

2346
01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:46.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2347
01:50:46.110 --> 01:50:46.710
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tj,</v>

2348
01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:51.730
<v Speaker 3>he's how it has two belts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a European national champion in </v>

2349
01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:51.730
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has got another belt for something else.</v>

2350
01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.080
<v Speaker 3>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does this come from?</v>

2351
01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:55.150
<v Speaker 3>This is my work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2352
01:50:55.151 --> 01:51:00.151
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of guys were crying because </v>

2353
01:51:00.151 --> 01:51:00.151
<v Speaker 3>they tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They work hard,</v>

2354
01:51:00.151 --> 01:51:00.151
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

2355
01:51:00.151 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 3>I my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it does not involve the fight game,</v>

2356
01:51:01.571 --> 01:51:04.570
<v Speaker 3>it does not involve me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was it.</v>

2357
01:51:04.571 --> 01:51:09.571
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other guys have extracurricular </v>

2358
01:51:09.571 --> 01:51:09.571
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2359
01:51:09.571 --> 01:51:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I count my money and I fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are the two things I like to </v>

2360
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a game changer,</v>

2361
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 3>game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like shale times to best thing that</v>

2362
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:18.430
<v Speaker 3>ever happened to Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aldo is career profile.</v>

2363
01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:24.060
<v Speaker 3>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless it goes down the way connor </v>

2364
01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:26.431
<v Speaker 3>thinks it's going to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's probably the worst thing to </v>

2365
01:51:26.431 --> 01:51:28.501
<v Speaker 3>have some guy come along and humiliate </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then fuck you up and you leave with </v>

2366
01:51:28.501 --> 01:51:29.140
<v Speaker 3>a check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were one of the best pound for pound</v>

2367
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:34.141
<v Speaker 3>fighters in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if connor could do to him what he </v>

2368
01:51:34.141 --> 01:51:34.141
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dustin Poirier,</v>

2369
01:51:34.141 --> 01:51:35.230
<v Speaker 3>that would be the most shocking thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've ever seen inside the.</v>

2370
01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:40.320
<v Speaker 3>It'll be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you compare a dozen poirier as a </v>

2371
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:40.320
<v Speaker 3>fighter to Jose?</v>

2372
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Aldo is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2373
01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.670
<v Speaker 3>and that's no disrespect to dustin </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think Dustin was doing himself</v>

2374
01:51:42.671 --> 01:51:46.030
<v Speaker 3>a disservice by cutting down at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you look fucking sensational.</v>

2375
01:51:46.031 --> 01:51:48.580
<v Speaker 3>His last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked amazing at 55.</v>

2376
01:51:48.581 --> 01:51:49.860
<v Speaker 3>He looked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look comfortable.</v>

2377
01:51:49.861 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 3>They look thick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was moving while he still fast as shit.</v>

2378
01:51:53.230 --> 01:51:58.230
<v Speaker 3>I think Dustin's a big boy and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys had cut down to 45 like that </v>

2379
01:51:58.230 --> 01:52:02.350
<v Speaker 3>or fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your body's getting tortured and </v>

2380
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of bounce back from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're younger,</v>

2381
01:52:04.031 --> 01:52:07.420
<v Speaker 3>it's easier than when you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've been in the game a long time</v>

2382
01:52:07.421 --> 01:52:12.421
<v Speaker 3>and your body has been taken kicks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>punches and you know you're dehydrating </v>

2383
01:52:12.421 --> 01:52:13.990
<v Speaker 3>and every few months and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehydrating it,</v>

2384
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.140
<v Speaker 3>like after a while that's shit is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pay.</v>

2385
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.210
<v Speaker 3>You're going to pay a price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to pay its toll.</v>

2386
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:21.540
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2387
01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:26.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that a guy who is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter that cuts less weight and has a </v>

2388
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:33.300
<v Speaker 3>less great advantage but has a full </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy body and all of the endurance </v>

2389
01:52:34.271 --> 01:52:39.271
<v Speaker 3>that comes with that and all the peace </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mind knowing that you slept well and </v>

2390
01:52:39.271 --> 01:52:42.961
<v Speaker 3>ate well and your body feels really </v>
<v Speaker 3>rested and you probably are better off </v>

2391
01:52:42.961 --> 01:52:46.210
<v Speaker 3>somewhere on the comfortable side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that than in the comfortable side of too</v>

2392
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.370
<v Speaker 3>dehydrated because those are the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wind up looking almost like there's</v>

2393
01:52:49.371 --> 01:52:54.371
<v Speaker 3>points where they're almost like </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpless because their body has </v>

2394
01:52:54.371 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 3>dehydrated so much.</v>

2395
01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:58.630
<v Speaker 3>And the grueling newness of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some guys you never see do it.</v>

2396
01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Some guys pull it off like Benson </v>
<v Speaker 3>Henderson.</v>

2397
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:01.730
<v Speaker 3>He pulls it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2398
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:03.920
<v Speaker 3>He pulls it off like you never see that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy tired,</v>

2399
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:07.400
<v Speaker 3>you never see that guy worn out and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>loses a lot of weight.</v>

2400
01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:10.250
<v Speaker 3>But then when you saw him fight against </v>
<v Speaker 3>brandon batch,</v>

2401
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:15.580
<v Speaker 3>what you saw is one guy who was enormous</v>
<v Speaker 3>batch who's a huge for one seven.</v>

2402
01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.370
<v Speaker 3>He cuts a lot of weight so big and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Benson wasn't cotton,</v>

2403
01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.030
<v Speaker 3>hardly any weight at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>

2404
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:25.120
<v Speaker 3>to fight at one 70 because usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights it time especially and great and </v>

2405
01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:29.951
<v Speaker 3>part of it you have to consider is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Benson is a guy with way more </v>

2406
01:53:29.951 --> 01:53:33.731
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more ways to win and a way better </v>

2407
01:53:33.731 --> 01:53:34.790
<v Speaker 3>ground game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Benson has a legitimate blackbelt</v>

2408
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 3>ground game and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2409
01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.990
<v Speaker 3>his manager and trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Crouch,</v>

2410
01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 3>he's legit as they come.</v>

2411
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Like Benson is super good on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very good on the ground despite the</v>

2412
01:53:45.111 --> 01:53:50.111
<v Speaker 3>fact that pet is condom in that arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just so God damn quick and </v>

2413
01:53:50.111 --> 01:53:50.111
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:53:50.111 --> 01:53:50.600
<v Speaker 3>But when you look at his real ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>

2415
01:53:50.601 --> 01:53:52.010
<v Speaker 3>like when he fucked that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she realized like,</v>

2416
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 3>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

2417
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:57.140
<v Speaker 3>it might be better if he fought bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys and he was healthy.</v>

2418
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:58.970
<v Speaker 3>It might be better because he's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>technical,</v>

2419
01:53:59.190 --> 01:54:04.190
<v Speaker 3>like it's not a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the guys who rely on slugging </v>

2420
01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:04.880
<v Speaker 3>it out and smashing and hulk smashing </v>
<v Speaker 3>dudes.</v>

2421
01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Those guys have to be really big for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their way class.</v>

2422
01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.920
<v Speaker 3>But the guys who fight like Benson or </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Frankie,</v>

2423
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:13.300
<v Speaker 3>super technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super endurance constantly on you,</v>

2424
01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always cutting angles,</v>

2425
01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:16.270
<v Speaker 3>always making you work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always pushing.</v>

2426
01:54:16.271 --> 01:54:17.480
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always putting pressure on you.</v>

2427
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I think Benson Henderson is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2428
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can keep me with anybody in 70.</v>

2429
01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Certainly Robbie lawler and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2430
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:28.730
<v Speaker 3>any of those guys and Johnny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of very similar.</v>

2431
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.550
<v Speaker 3>He's just as tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be a little shorter.</v>

2432
01:54:31.551 --> 01:54:36.551
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody in the 70 pound weight </v>

2433
01:54:36.551 --> 01:54:37.490
<v Speaker 3>class that I think gives him a beating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including Carlos.</v>

2434
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2435
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:43.470
<v Speaker 3>he mean he could be a champion at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven and everybody says that's </v>

2436
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.470
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>

2437
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:44.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking weight classes,</v>

2438
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:45.690
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2439
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Anybody in any given night in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight class could be a champion.</v>

2440
01:54:48.591 --> 01:54:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Same with 55.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rory Macdonald can be a champion.</v>

2441
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Robbie lawler is the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2442
01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.150
<v Speaker 3>either one of those guys could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>

2443
01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:58.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean condit could still.</v>

2444
01:54:58.431 --> 01:55:01.700
<v Speaker 3>He champion Woodley could be championed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hugged her lumbar,</v>

2445
01:55:01.701 --> 01:55:02.750
<v Speaker 3>could be champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>

2446
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:05.080
<v Speaker 3>I keep forgetting about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like hector,</v>

2447
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:06.590
<v Speaker 3>he's out for a year.</v>

2448
01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steroids for the juice is my friend had </v>

2449
01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:12.990
<v Speaker 3>the juices study said that anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>does steroids should be banned for life.</v>

2450
01:55:12.991 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 3>And he says my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone gave him a drink.</v>

2451
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:20.471
<v Speaker 3>My friend rubbed oil on his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was looking a.</v>

2452
01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:25.630
<v Speaker 3>This is some translation issues between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish and English or the pharmacy man.</v>

2453
01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Fucking nose gave him something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talk about the 85 pound weight class.</v>

2454
01:55:30.951 --> 01:55:35.951
<v Speaker 3>Seventy pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget about him and I forgot about </v>

2455
01:55:35.951 --> 01:55:35.951
<v Speaker 3>guys like Yoel Romero and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he's 70 now.</v>

2456
01:55:35.951 --> 01:55:38.870
<v Speaker 3>He went down to 17 hectors at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2457
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.960
<v Speaker 3>but you'll all Romero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's another one.</v>

2458
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 3>That was a bummer that he didn't get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rey this weekend.</v>

2459
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:47.910
<v Speaker 3>What happened to him is he got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hurt his knee,</v>

2460
01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:49.290
<v Speaker 3>dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2461
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:54.000
<v Speaker 3>That was an insane fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then became an insane demonstration.</v>

2462
01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:59.180
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That Jeff of Jacques Rey Armbar and </v>

2463
01:55:59.180 --> 01:55:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Chris Kamozi I think.</v>

2464
01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I think if I had to put money on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoel Romero shocker,</v>

2465
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:06.390
<v Speaker 3>a fight I go with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with A.</v>

2466
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think your morale or if he's </v>

2467
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:12.090
<v Speaker 3>fighting five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's four and five,</v>

2468
01:56:12.091 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 3>he starts to gas because he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much muscle to feet.</v>

2469
01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:19.791
<v Speaker 3>So the top one is the guard pass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was equally ridiculously </v>

2470
01:56:19.791 --> 01:56:23.781
<v Speaker 3>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the bottom one is the actual arm </v>

2471
01:56:23.781 --> 01:56:23.781
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2472
01:56:23.781 --> 01:56:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the guard pass.</v>

2473
01:56:24.001 --> 01:56:28.020
<v Speaker 3>We just look all the weight he put on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them with a one shoulder.</v>

2474
01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:30.660
<v Speaker 3>Whereas whole bodies up priest turn off </v>
<v Speaker 3>ad block.</v>

2475
01:56:30.661 --> 01:56:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitches running scripts on your ships,</v>

2476
01:56:36.630 --> 01:56:39.090
<v Speaker 3>find it on another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to another website.</v>

2477
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

2478
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:43.010
<v Speaker 3>point being this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2479
01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.280
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this era that we're living in right now </v>

2480
01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:48.390
<v Speaker 3>was like greatest ever for martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2481
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's ever been a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever in my life where I've seen this </v>

2482
01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:54.990
<v Speaker 3>level of execution on a scale like this.</v>

2483
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:57.180
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't exist before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't exist.</v>

2484
01:56:57.181 --> 01:57:01.410
<v Speaker 3>When you combine the skill level of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxers,</v>

2485
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:06.440
<v Speaker 3>like the glory kickboxers skill level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys that are coming out of </v>

2486
01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2487
01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.690
<v Speaker 3>it's just all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody sharing their own techniques,</v>

2488
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.040
<v Speaker 3>we will call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2489
01:57:11.041 --> 01:57:13.830
<v Speaker 3>you can watch them online now too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That helps a lot.</v>

2490
01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:17.340
<v Speaker 3>And there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that overall Jujitsu,</v>

2491
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Muay Thai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing and mma,</v>

2492
01:57:20.281 --> 01:57:25.281
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's ever been a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has been even close to be </v>

2493
01:57:25.281 --> 01:57:28.290
<v Speaker 3>represented the way martial arts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent it today.</v>

2494
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:31.300
<v Speaker 3>But that's just part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real impressive thing was the,</v>

2495
01:57:31.301 --> 01:57:33.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transition to that.</v>

2496
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:35.730
<v Speaker 3>They were going a scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the end of it.</v>

2497
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:41.210
<v Speaker 3>They were in a scramble and jock array,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dove on his arm and threw a leg over </v>

2498
01:57:41.851 --> 01:57:46.851
<v Speaker 3>and then hooked him under his leg to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep them from rolling out of it and </v>

2499
01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 3>then scoot his hips to the left and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was watching.</v>

2500
01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is art.</v>

2501
01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:52.890
<v Speaker 3>That's ballet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a master.</v>

2502
01:57:52.891 --> 01:57:54.630
<v Speaker 3>I think something else was happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>

2503
01:57:54.631 --> 01:57:55.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2504
01:57:55.381 --> 01:57:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was going for the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I saw him,</v>

2505
01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:00.300
<v Speaker 3>I think I probably yelled at how he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>diving for an arm,</v>

2506
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:02.250
<v Speaker 3>but I could tell that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does that all the time.</v>

2507
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:07.251
<v Speaker 3>Some guys don't like to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a tricky transition between like </v>

2508
01:58:07.251 --> 01:58:08.190
<v Speaker 3>sometimes from the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guys will say,</v>

2509
01:58:08.191 --> 01:58:10.170
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is defending the choke to good.</v>

2510
01:58:10.171 --> 01:58:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to set up the arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2511
01:58:11.821 --> 01:58:16.821
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who smart Paul Horez did that to Ivan </v>

2512
01:58:16.821 --> 01:58:19.140
<v Speaker 3>salivary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went from the back to an arm bar.</v>

2513
01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:23.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of him doing that same </v>
<v Speaker 3>exact transition to a gym to.</v>

2514
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jason Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2515
01:58:26.401 --> 01:58:31.401
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of techniques like that </v>

2516
01:58:31.401 --> 01:58:33.420
<v Speaker 3>where he can transition from the back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

2517
01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Jaggery does like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got like levels of transitions that</v>

2518
01:58:37.201 --> 01:58:42.201
<v Speaker 3>other people just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was watching combos and OSC </v>

2519
01:58:42.201 --> 01:58:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Kamozi trying to figure out what Rey was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing while he was doing it and it was </v>

2520
01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:47.980
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so high level.</v>

2521
01:58:47.981 --> 01:58:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so high level,</v>

2522
01:58:50.230 --> 01:58:54.610
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a guy who does Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you watch how,</v>

2523
01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:57.640
<v Speaker 3>how this transitioned flows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not it.</v>

2524
01:58:57.641 --> 01:58:59.320
<v Speaker 3>You got to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's before that.</v>

2525
01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's before that.</v>

2526
01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:03.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's they missed the whole thing.</v>

2527
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:07.450
<v Speaker 3>So this is just an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an bar and it's impressive,</v>

2528
01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:12.630
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was impressive was the full </v>

2529
01:59:12.630 --> 01:59:12.630
<v Speaker 3>transition go to that grappling world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2530
01:59:12.630 --> 01:59:16.480
<v Speaker 3>instagram grappling world on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I said it was a,</v>

2531
01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.850
<v Speaker 3>you could see the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way he does it,</v>

2532
01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:23.851
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have to have this insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of where to put your legs in </v>

2533
01:59:23.851 --> 01:59:28.261
<v Speaker 3>the transition where he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely wind up where his legs going to </v>

2534
01:59:28.261 --> 01:59:32.461
<v Speaker 3>kick and there's so much data that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>calculating and it's all based on </v>

2535
01:59:32.461 --> 01:59:32.461
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

2536
01:59:32.461 --> 01:59:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Just like very minimal effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like none of that that he did with </v>

2537
01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:38.350
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's like the most pure expression</v>

2538
01:59:38.351 --> 01:59:43.351
<v Speaker 3>of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean certainly strong as fuck </v>

2539
01:59:43.351 --> 01:59:43.351
<v Speaker 3>strengths certainly aided him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling off the moon.</v>

2540
01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is that move was </v>

2541
01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:48.360
<v Speaker 3>pulled off because of his perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

2542
01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be physically strong person </v>

2543
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:55.210
<v Speaker 3>to do anything to a Jujitsu person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was no resistance there.</v>

2544
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 3>If you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was defense,</v>

2545
01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:02.040
<v Speaker 3>but the way he moved into that position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was never resisted because he was so </v>

2546
02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:06.481
<v Speaker 3>far ahead of Kamozi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technically like in the dive </v>

2547
02:00:06.481 --> 02:00:06.481
<v Speaker 3>commodities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2548
02:00:06.481 --> 02:00:06.481
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's diving going,</v>

2549
02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.940
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was already set.</v>

2550
02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:09.490
<v Speaker 3>He was adamant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was way ahead of.</v>

2551
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's way ahead of when you roll with </v>

2552
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.510
<v Speaker 3>really good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

2553
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.510
<v Speaker 3>They are ahead of you.</v>

2554
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:15.940
<v Speaker 3>They've been there before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've seen what you're going to do.</v>

2555
02:00:15.941 --> 02:00:18.850
<v Speaker 3>They can predict what you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes if they're really good,</v>

2556
02:00:18.851 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 3>they can get you to think you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do something you do that.</v>

2557
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:23.680
<v Speaker 3>They already know you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2558
02:00:23.681 --> 02:00:28.681
<v Speaker 3>and then they capitalize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes shocker a truly </v>

2559
02:00:28.681 --> 02:00:28.681
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2560
02:00:28.681 --> 02:00:32.250
<v Speaker 3>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two running right now for the </v>

2561
02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:32.250
<v Speaker 3>number one contender after this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman,</v>

2562
02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:36.661
<v Speaker 3>Vito Belfort fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's shock array and who won on the </v>

2563
02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:36.661
<v Speaker 3>quote and then Luke rockhold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2564
02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:41.460
<v Speaker 3>and I think Luke rockhold made a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement by beating Machida and </v>

2565
02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:42.240
<v Speaker 3>smashing them with a choke hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beat.</v>

2566
02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Shocker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2567
02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2568
02:00:44.081 --> 02:00:46.480
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did your take on that,</v>

2569
02:00:46.570 --> 02:00:47.500
<v Speaker 3>but there's a very good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2570
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 3>I think rockhold against anybody is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very good fight.</v>

2571
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Rockhold is a mother fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2572
02:00:51.671 --> 02:00:53.670
<v Speaker 3>There's no denying it now after what?</v>

2573
02:00:53.670 --> 02:00:57.030
<v Speaker 3>He did a good looking guy either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only reason why anybody gets laid is</v>

2574
02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.700
<v Speaker 3>because rockhold didn't get their first </v>
<v Speaker 3>got there.</v>

2575
02:01:00.701 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 3>First do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be no pussy for anybody else.</v>

2576
02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:04.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the bottom line is hansel </v>
<v Speaker 3>bastard,</v>

2577
02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:09.250
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly what it does inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the octagon is super unusual.</v>

2578
02:01:09.251 --> 02:01:14.251
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a long guy is like Javier Mendez </v>

2579
02:01:14.251 --> 02:01:17.131
<v Speaker 3>explained it to me in the cage after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and I was congratulating him and </v>

2580
02:01:17.131 --> 02:01:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Bob Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Javier said he's long and he's strong </v>

2581
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.790
<v Speaker 3>and usually don't get those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2582
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's a long dude,</v>

2583
02:01:22.211 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 3>but he's also yoked as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like a long,</v>

2584
02:01:25.061 --> 02:01:30.061
<v Speaker 3>skinny Roger Gracie type grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's long and he's yoked and he trains </v>

2585
02:01:30.961 --> 02:01:34.650
<v Speaker 3>on a daily basis with Kane motherfucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>full last name.</v>

2586
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:35.360

<v Speaker 3>known outside of Baltimore.</v>

2590
02:01:44.050 --> 02:01:49.050
<v Speaker 3>This is just two guys that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>never consider to be the greatest </v>

2591
02:01:49.050 --> 02:01:50.060
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight cyber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one who's in the UFC.</v>

2597
02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.160
<v Speaker 3>The earlier days of his career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a little thicker.</v>

2598

<v Speaker 3>division in pride back then was probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of Tim Silvia and Frank Mir,</v>

2616
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:06.500
<v Speaker 3>who in their prime could give anybody a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard time.</v>

2617
02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:12.100
<v Speaker 3>That was probably the strongest </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight division the world has ever </v>

2618
02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:13.010
<v Speaker 3>known because everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2619
02:03:13.011 --> 02:03:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I was allowed to do all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans.</v>

2620
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:21.160
<v Speaker 3>She can do whatever the fuck you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were dealing with guys who were </v>

2621
02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:21.500
<v Speaker 3>fighting for a lot of fucking money.</v>

2622
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got.</v>

2623
02:03:23.661 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Got Alexander Million Inco,</v>

2624
02:03:25.701 --> 02:03:26.720
<v Speaker 3>you've got cro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cop,</v>

2625
02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:31.760
<v Speaker 3>you got cro cop in his prime when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>head kick and ventilate asleep,</v>

2626
02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:34.780
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my cookie mooglie.</v>

2627
02:03:34.781 --> 02:03:39.680
<v Speaker 3>You've got Minataro who was fighting off</v>
<v Speaker 3>his back and triangling Mark Cole,</v>

2628
02:03:39.681 --> 02:03:43.590
<v Speaker 3>but off his back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like call in in his prime crazy.</v>

2629
02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Coleman was strong as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nothing to triangle.</v>

2630
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Just a head and shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minataro when he was off his back was </v>

2631
02:03:52.150 --> 02:03:52.150
<v Speaker 3>special dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2632
02:03:52.150 --> 02:03:56.451
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He represented a thing that no one had </v>

2633
02:03:56.451 --> 02:03:59.021
<v Speaker 3>ever seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black </v>

2634
02:03:59.021 --> 02:04:00.570
<v Speaker 3>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's a fucking bonafide heavyweight who</v>

2635
02:04:00.571 --> 02:04:04.700
<v Speaker 3>strangles guys off his back because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the mentor.</v>

2636
02:04:04.701 --> 02:04:05.120
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2637
02:04:05.121 --> 02:04:08.000
<v Speaker 3>you got lost in the maze of his Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>or what was it?</v>

2638
02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:09.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2639
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess that's what it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't want to get lost in </v>

2640
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:14.800
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>

2641
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Charles Mayes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's just like he's half bull.</v>

2642
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:18.270
<v Speaker 3>So fucking strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2643
02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:19.730
<v Speaker 3>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was tough.</v>

2644
02:04:20.010 --> 02:04:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just started another lap.</v>

2645
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Just another level of toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think about minotauro.</v>

2646
02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fate or beat him in his prime and fader </v>

2647
02:04:30.730 --> 02:04:32.890
<v Speaker 3>beat cro cop in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never.</v>

2648
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett and him never fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he was in Josh.</v>

2649
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Josh was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Randleman.</v>

2650
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Remember that he beat Kevin Randleman </v>
<v Speaker 3>flex.</v>

2651
02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:41.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin,</v>

2652
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:44.670
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got an arm bar just moments later.</v>

2653
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 3>So it's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll break this.</v>

2654
02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Top.</v>

2655
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:51.780
<v Speaker 3>That was the craziest transition dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a motherfucker.</v>

2656
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:54.000
<v Speaker 3>He was a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fader was a motherfucker,</v>

2657
02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.700
<v Speaker 3>but if I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's timing with those shots.</v>

2658
02:04:56.701 --> 02:05:01.701
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his ability to knock guys out and </v>

2659
02:05:01.701 --> 02:05:04.071
<v Speaker 3>he's saying uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Andre Arlovski knocked him out in </v>

2660
02:05:04.071 --> 02:05:07.401
<v Speaker 3>the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was by the way a fight where </v>

2661
02:05:07.401 --> 02:05:07.401
<v Speaker 3>our last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was picking them apart and that was a</v>

2662
02:05:07.401 --> 02:05:08.130
<v Speaker 3>fight where a lot of people looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2663
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:14.300
<v Speaker 3>This guy's got some holes and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>also a fight where he was criticized by </v>

2664
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:14.300
<v Speaker 3>his old trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trainer was saying,</v>

2665
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:15.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's up to his old tricks.</v>

2666
02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:20.600
<v Speaker 3>He won with a trick like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't prepare for this </v>

2667
02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His trainer was vocal about that.</v>

2668
02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:23.160
<v Speaker 3>That training with Freddie Roach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2669
02:05:23.550 --> 02:05:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2670
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:29.630
<v Speaker 3>well Arloski got crazy and went with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that flying knee and if he didn't go </v>

2671
02:05:29.630 --> 02:05:32.571
<v Speaker 3>with the flying knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what would happen if you </v>

2672
02:05:32.571 --> 02:05:33.750
<v Speaker 3>continue to pick them apart like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have been crazy.</v>

2673
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It could have been crazy to watch fate </v>
<v Speaker 3>or get kick boxed,</v>

2674
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:38.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Arlovski,</v>

2675
02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.580
<v Speaker 3>at least on paper was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2676
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:45.650
<v Speaker 3>very formidable kickbox and threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had like one punch knockout power </v>

2677
02:05:45.650 --> 02:05:48.900
<v Speaker 3>lasers straight right hand me through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>right hand that when he knocked out Paul</v>

2678
02:05:48.901 --> 02:05:51.450
<v Speaker 3>blend like early in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he threw a right hand.</v>

2679
02:05:51.450 --> 02:05:55.140
<v Speaker 3>It was like a bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to really comes off his shoulder hits</v>

2680
02:05:55.141 --> 02:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>you in your genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what the fuck happened?</v>

2681
02:05:56.941 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 3>He's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Arlovski was in his prime dude,</v>

2682
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:05.930
<v Speaker 3>people were terrified of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember the first time he came in </v>

2683
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get this 240 pound guy moved like a</v>

2684
02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.510
<v Speaker 3>small man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that pony tail?</v>

2685
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when fader or gone to him,</v>

2686
02:06:10.381 --> 02:06:14.580
<v Speaker 3>he had lost a few and he'd been out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC in fighting for affliction,</v>

2687
02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:20.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still still was pretty </v>

2688
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:21.600
<v Speaker 3>formidable five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

2689
02:06:21.690 --> 02:06:26.690
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you'd have to have a time </v>

2690
02:06:26.690 --> 02:06:28.641
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to coordinate like you know </v>

2691
02:06:28.641 --> 02:06:31.080
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what version of cane before the first </v>

2692
02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:32.670
<v Speaker 3>fight with junior dos Santos before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second fight with junior dos Santos,</v>

2693
02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean junior dos Santos knocked him out</v>

2694
02:06:35.161 --> 02:06:39.840
<v Speaker 3>in the first fight and then they went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking war for two fights in a row.</v>

2695
02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.700
<v Speaker 3>And those fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to think like,</v>

2696
02:06:41.701 --> 02:06:46.701
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fade or obviously lost a step </v>

2697
02:06:46.701 --> 02:06:50.090
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along the way and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>attribute it if you don't attribute it </v>

2698
02:06:50.090 --> 02:06:54.831
<v Speaker 3>to his focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what his focus wasn't </v>

2699
02:06:54.831 --> 02:06:54.831
<v Speaker 3>training his coaches saying something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2700
02:06:54.831 --> 02:06:58.540
<v Speaker 3>It could be that he was kind of getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>tired of fighting or it could be the god</v>

2701
02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:00.630
<v Speaker 3>wars he went through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2702
02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:05.660
<v Speaker 3>nobody rides for free when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>those crazy fucking 10 minute rounds of </v>

2703
02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:07.440
<v Speaker 3>sparring sessions that he would go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

2704
02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:08.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet me.</v>

2705
02:07:08.221 --> 02:07:12.750
<v Speaker 3>We were talking to Tony Jeffries about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and he was calculating and he was.</v>

2706
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:15.840
<v Speaker 3>He had 106 fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>26 of which were pro I think.</v>

2707
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:20.790
<v Speaker 3>And he said if you look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds I fought to prepare for those 106</v>

2708
02:07:20.791 --> 02:07:23.730
<v Speaker 3>fights and this is when I became an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amateur is not when I was a kid.</v>

2709
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 3>He calculated it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes about.</v>

2710
02:07:26.110 --> 02:07:29.570
<v Speaker 3>He took over 55,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>shots that God to him,</v>

2711
02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:34.580
<v Speaker 3>$5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so crazy and call for a lot of </v>

2712
02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:35.140
<v Speaker 3>boxers because you've got to take into </v>
<v Speaker 3>account the,</v>

2713
02:07:35.210 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the five</v>

2714
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 1>jabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the five jobs you'd take around.</v>

2715
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Even if they're light when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>

2716
02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so crazy when you know,</v>

2717
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:49.770
<v Speaker 1>when you just think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different micro injuries and different </v>

2718
02:07:50.651 --> 02:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>times that Brian's rattling against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skull.</v>

2719
02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Different little things that have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connective tissue that's separating or </v>

2720
02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:00.610
<v Speaker 1>twisting or popping or I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you need some of that in life?</v>

2721
02:08:00.611 --> 02:08:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I was going to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know trauma?</v>

2722
02:08:02.630 --> 02:08:03.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2723
02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:08.100
<v Speaker 1>well somebody didn't call his pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This French general I think are a </v>

2724
02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:11.701
<v Speaker 1>British general said we have to have war</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if a man doesn't have war will </v>

2725
02:08:11.701 --> 02:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will dissolve into materialism.</v>

2726
02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that sounds like a general but.</v>

2727
02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:19.840
<v Speaker 1>But there is something to be said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a conflict free world as we were talking</v>

2728
02:08:19.841 --> 02:08:24.841

<v Speaker 1>sort of live in a world that is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course like the Mongols,</v>

2735
02:08:42.311 --> 02:08:44.920

<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

2736
02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:48.190
<v Speaker 1>They are always in touch with kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up with their own,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on this fucking birds back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why would it be so hard to imagine </v>

2777
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.390
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the weasel jump on his back and </v>

<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just a small country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2817
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiians are Hawaiians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not Americans.</v>

2818
02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>They are American and since they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the meal and protect them with the </v>

<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is Hawaii.</v>

2822

2825
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Where's that left hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got an upper ass in that second </v>

2826
02:12:36.250 --> 02:12:36.710
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just this is not real.</v>

2827
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are hilarious.</v>

2828
02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:42.050
<v Speaker 1>These are hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chunk of your edge missing.</v>

2829
02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a high resolution photo.</v>

2830
02:12:44.511 --> 02:12:49.511
<v Speaker 1>You fucking Weirdos till they understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between looking at </v>

2831
02:12:49.511 --> 02:12:53.621
<v Speaker 1>something with a white background and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at something with a black </v>

2832
02:12:53.621 --> 02:12:53.621
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go up to that ear.</v>

2833
02:12:53.621 --> 02:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll just prove this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking dummy.</v>

2834
02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:56.030
<v Speaker 1>They see the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See where the transition is.</v>

2835
02:12:56.031 --> 02:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>The transition is right where the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>meats,</v>

2836
02:12:57.831 --> 02:13:02.831
<v Speaker 1>the black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why it happened because the </v>

2837
02:13:02.831 --> 02:13:02.831
<v Speaker 1>camera picks it up again to bring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2838
02:13:02.831 --> 02:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>This is becoming the Dan Carlin </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

2839
02:13:04.401 --> 02:13:09.401
<v Speaker 1>but he said something really cool about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people like conspiracy theories </v>

2840
02:13:09.401 --> 02:13:13.661
<v Speaker 1>because it's really hard to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the random just happens where that one </v>

2841
02:13:13.661 --> 02:13:17.321
<v Speaker 1>man like Lee Harvey Oswald can change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of history with a bullet and </v>

2842
02:13:17.321 --> 02:13:18.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot harder to believe than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2843
02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>a group of people who were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized ended up doing what they did </v>

2844
02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all want.</v>

2845
02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:27.140
<v Speaker 1>We want to a logical explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a random one,</v>

2846
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 1>not the fact that we're fragile enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one man can fuck everything up with</v>

2847
02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:34.650
<v Speaker 3>with a good bullet or a good bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2848
02:13:34.651 --> 02:13:39.651
<v Speaker 3>it's that time where that was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's possible today and </v>

2849
02:13:39.651 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly to a lesser extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's certainly there's a weirder</v>

2850
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:48.350
<v Speaker 3>connection that people share today than </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've ever done before and I wonder </v>

2851
02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:53.541
<v Speaker 3>how much we realize about how that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaping society's shaping.</v>

2852
02:13:54.181 --> 02:13:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Just human civilization as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2853
02:13:56.791 --> 02:13:59.740
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about before as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic super organism,</v>

2854
02:13:59.930 --> 02:14:04.930
<v Speaker 3>super organism that relied on aggression</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to a certain point of innovation </v>

2855
02:14:04.930 --> 02:14:06.720
<v Speaker 3>and then once it got to that certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>point of innovation,</v>

2856
02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:11.721
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when does it no longer need aggression </v>

2857
02:14:11.721 --> 02:14:15.740
<v Speaker 3>and when does it need like a realization</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what it actually is instead of </v>

2858
02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:19.011
<v Speaker 3>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When does it need a real realization </v>

2859
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:19.011
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2860
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:19.011
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way that's going gonna work out</v>

2861
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:21.150
<v Speaker 3>for everybody as we got to act for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

2862
02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:26.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the human race just treats everybody </v>

2863
02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:29.481
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to find where the weak </v>

2864
02:14:29.481 --> 02:14:29.481
<v Speaker 3>spots are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prop them up,</v>

2865
02:14:29.481 --> 02:14:31.410
<v Speaker 3>figure out why they're fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineered correctly.</v>

2866
02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as social engineering,</v>

2867
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:36.270
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>counseling are you saying that we should</v>

2868
02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:41.300
<v Speaker 3>do unto others as you'd have them do </v>
<v Speaker 3>unto us as rabbi hello and a guy named </v>

2869
02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:46.011
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once you get to a point where you </v>

2870
02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:49.161
<v Speaker 3>have something called the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can exchange these ideas and </v>

2871
02:14:49.161 --> 02:14:54.051
<v Speaker 3>exchange these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these points of view and these </v>

2872
02:14:54.051 --> 02:14:54.051
<v Speaker 3>expressions like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how I feel about you,</v>

2873
02:14:54.051 --> 02:14:55.980
<v Speaker 3>is how you feel about me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you communication like this,</v>

2874
02:14:56.330 --> 02:15:01.330
<v Speaker 3>you can communicate like this in real </v>
<v Speaker 3>time in a way that's never happened </v>

2875
02:15:01.330 --> 02:15:05.181
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're not like these weird people </v>

2876
02:15:05.181 --> 02:15:06.360
<v Speaker 3>in Germany that you don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they have this guy standing on top of</v>

2877
02:15:06.361 --> 02:15:08.160
<v Speaker 3>a podium and he's screaming shit out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2878
02:15:08.161 --> 02:15:09.180
<v Speaker 3>what's going on over there?</v>

2879
02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Why are they all marching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they all goose step in like that?</v>

2880
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing with the Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2881
02:15:14.401 --> 02:15:19.401
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're reading things about it in </v>

2882
02:15:19.401 --> 02:15:22.191
<v Speaker 3>the paper and you're trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>these little printed words and piece </v>

2883
02:15:22.191 --> 02:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>them into a narrative that makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head.</v>

2884
02:15:23.730 --> 02:15:26.550
<v Speaker 3>You're reading the New York Times every </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning to find out what's the news,</v>

2885
02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:31.551
<v Speaker 3>what the with Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on over there without boys </v>

2886
02:15:31.551 --> 02:15:34.880
<v Speaker 3>and you want to look into the paper </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find out how the score is the </v>

2887
02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:36.090
<v Speaker 3>war and you're listening to the radio at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

2888
02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:41.240
<v Speaker 3>the fucking radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're listening to the radio to </v>

2889
02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Kranich's blaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would go to the movies and they </v>

2890
02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:44.500
<v Speaker 3>would show a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a highlight war,</v>

2891
02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:47.730
<v Speaker 3>real clip of the news while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for your movie to start.</v>

2892
02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I know what the fuck.</v>

2893
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm very controlled to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your information was controlled.</v>

2894
02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:57.860
<v Speaker 3>War was actually was actually kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>presented in a very sanitized way as </v>

2895
02:16:01.081 --> 02:16:06.081
<v Speaker 3>well and in many ways still is like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that when you get hit with heavy </v>

2896
02:16:06.081 --> 02:16:06.090
<v Speaker 3>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come apart.</v>

2897
02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:09.420
<v Speaker 3>There are not holes in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't show a lot of that stuff.</v>

2898
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Probably shouldn't lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't.</v>

2899
02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:13.690
<v Speaker 3>We?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't.</v>

2900
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be good for people to know what the</v>

2901
02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:17.060
<v Speaker 3>fuck they're signing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2902
02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:22.360
<v Speaker 3>I know that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that the logic was always that </v>

2903
02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.660
<v Speaker 3>you censored media during war time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't let them show the really horrific</v>

2904
02:16:24.661 --> 02:16:29.661
<v Speaker 3>stuff because it was bad for morale </v>
<v Speaker 3>among troops and at home.</v>

2905
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense to you?</v>

2906
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:37.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to motivate young men to go to battle.</v>

2907
02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a general or a person in power </v>

2908
02:16:43.170 --> 02:16:44.950
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in a war time situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like to be.</v>

2909
02:16:44.951 --> 02:16:49.951
<v Speaker 2>To have the very existence of my country</v>
<v Speaker 2>under threat the way we were in world </v>

2910
02:16:49.951 --> 02:16:49.951
<v Speaker 2>war two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that,</v>

2911
02:16:49.951 --> 02:16:53.650
<v Speaker 2>when those kinds of policies were made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know,</v>

2912
02:16:53.651 --> 02:16:58.651
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd have think I'd have a very </v>

2913
02:16:58.651 --> 02:17:01.021
<v Speaker 2>different point of view if I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all and I think we'd all have </v>

2914
02:17:01.021 --> 02:17:01.390
<v Speaker 2>very different points of view and would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do very,</v>

2915
02:17:01.391 --> 02:17:06.391
<v Speaker 2>very different things and behave maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot like the leaders we criticized if we</v>

2916
02:17:07.631 --> 02:17:12.631
<v Speaker 2>were under the kinds of responsibilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pressures that the leaders we talk </v>

2917
02:17:14.591 --> 02:17:15.460
<v Speaker 2>about we're under.</v>

2918
02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that if I were the emir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the caliphate of Baghdad,</v>

2919
02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:25.080
<v Speaker 2>and I knew that the Mongols were doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing to people and they </v>

2920
02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:29.671
<v Speaker 2>were on the way to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pretty ruthless with any kind of </v>

2921
02:17:29.671 --> 02:17:32.380
<v Speaker 2>dissent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of a Mongol sympathy,</v>

2922
02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:37.880
<v Speaker 2>and I would be pretty ruthless with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who wasn't pitching in for the </v>

2923
02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:41.821
<v Speaker 2>very survival of my my town because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences are so high have not taken </v>

2924
02:17:41.821 --> 02:17:44.350
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being aggressively prepared.</v>

2925
02:17:44.370 --> 02:17:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question becomes like how if ever is</v>

2926
02:17:47.891 --> 02:17:52.891
<v Speaker 2>it possible that because of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can communicate with each other </v>

2927
02:17:52.891 --> 02:17:55.861
<v Speaker 2>all across the world instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it possible that we move past the</v>

2928
02:17:56.111 --> 02:17:59.320
<v Speaker 2>idea of armed conflicts entirely?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like isn't it possible?</v>

2929
02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:01.810
<v Speaker 2>It is possible and it's already kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening?</v>

2930
02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.540
<v Speaker 2>How is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you say that when we're going to</v>

2931
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:04.990
<v Speaker 2>war?</v>

2932
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the middle of like pulling out </v>

2933
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.900
<v Speaker 2>of Iraq and Afghanistan while </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining thousands of troops.</v>

2934
02:18:10.901 --> 02:18:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have bases all over the world.</v>

2935
02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this isis shit that's going on.</v>

2936
02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:20.100
<v Speaker 2>There's this overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the number of violent </v>

2937
02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:23.851
<v Speaker 2>deaths from 2000 until 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to Steven pinker in his very </v>

2938
02:18:24.671 --> 02:18:29.671
<v Speaker 2>well researched book called the angels </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our better nature essentially said it</v>

2939
02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:35.100
<v Speaker 2>proves and and makes the case that fewer</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have died violently in that span </v>

2940
02:18:35.711 --> 02:18:37.120
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even with the Congo,</v>

2941
02:18:37.121 --> 02:18:42.121
<v Speaker 2>even with the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with all the things that go on in </v>

2942
02:18:42.121 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 2>comparison to any other time of epoch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other time in history,</v>

2943
02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:47.800
<v Speaker 2>and it seems that a lot of countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>like China,</v>

2944
02:18:47.801 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

2945
02:18:48.971 --> 02:18:51.550
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rattles sort of Taiwan and things,</v>

2946
02:18:51.551 --> 02:18:55.450
<v Speaker 2>but China gains a great deal more from </v>
<v Speaker 2>being an economic powerhouse.</v>

2947
02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Military Power House just isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I maintain this case with Iran.</v>

2948
02:18:59.890 --> 02:19:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Iran wants to Gemini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran wants control over parts of the </v>

2949
02:19:04.890 --> 02:19:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran has a lot of influence with the </v>

2950
02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Shia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shia,</v>

2951
02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Sunni schism in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2952
02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I think Iran gains a lot more and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could create incentives for Iran and we </v>

2953
02:19:13.350 --> 02:19:18.151
<v Speaker 2>are trying to at least parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government or some people disagree with </v>

2954
02:19:18.151 --> 02:19:21.091
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if you created a situation </v>

2955
02:19:21.091 --> 02:19:25.231
<v Speaker 2>where Iran saw that there was much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be gained from joining the Economic </v>

2956
02:19:25.231 --> 02:19:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Community and playing ball in accordance</v>
<v Speaker 2>with its laws is an in getting weapons </v>

2957
02:19:29.541 --> 02:19:32.600
<v Speaker 2>of mass destructions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all scared that those chicks are</v>

2958
02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 2>going to find out they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wear burkas in America.</v>

2959
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Votes cover your come over on boats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then seek out black dick like a magnet,</v>

2960
02:19:42.310 --> 02:19:47.310
<v Speaker 2>like a magnet to steal filings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps they're tired of being </v>

2961
02:19:47.310 --> 02:19:51.071
<v Speaker 2>suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want a torque on some dude in a </v>

2962
02:19:51.071 --> 02:19:51.071
<v Speaker 2>club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe no crazy,</v>

2963
02:19:51.071 --> 02:19:52.160
<v Speaker 2>funky religious outfit on and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

2964
02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:53.450
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no one knows to fuck.</v>

2965
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.190
<v Speaker 2>They look like they could just blend </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in.</v>

2966
02:19:55.220 --> 02:20:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with your passport photo when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's looking through a fucking lit of a </v>

2967
02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:02.861
<v Speaker 2>garbage can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Oscar the grouch and that's who </v>

2968
02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:03.530
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking passport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you see your eyeballs.</v>

2969
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they have to take this shit out for </v>

2970
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.750
<v Speaker 2>their passport?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2971
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they allowed to?</v>

2972
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:09.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like stealing their soul or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2973
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2974
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:14.740
<v Speaker 2>the minute that a lot of Saudi women go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to places like London and quake,</v>

2975
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:17.160
<v Speaker 2>guess what comes off immediately?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their headrest,</v>

2976
02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:22.180
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was shopping and they dress in </v>

2977
02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:22.670
<v Speaker 2>sexy outfits and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2978
02:20:22.671 --> 02:20:27.671
<v Speaker 2>cause see impression man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just amazing that you've got </v>

2979
02:20:27.671 --> 02:20:30.821
<v Speaker 2>countries that in 2015 still make women </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed like they're in star wars.</v>

2980
02:20:32.841 --> 02:20:34.010
<v Speaker 2>This is not a reason for it.</v>

2981
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Another reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another very logical reason </v>

2982
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:39.370
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logical.</v>

2983
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying if you're,</v>

2984
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:40.020
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're really,</v>

2985
02:20:40.050 --> 02:20:43.660
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're just saying,</v>

2986
02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:48.200
<v Speaker 2>if you're a religious man and if you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to create a productive society,</v>

2987
02:20:48.201 --> 02:20:52.790
<v Speaker 2>the logic went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have women walking around looking</v>

2988
02:20:52.791 --> 02:20:56.510
<v Speaker 2>all sexy and naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a lot of the Middle East,</v>

2989
02:20:57.050 --> 02:21:02.050
<v Speaker 2>well if you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is we're thinking about </v>

2993

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3013
02:21:59.081 --> 02:22:00.170
<v Speaker 2>no one knew how to do a love scene when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were an actor back in the day.</v>

3014
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:02.180
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never really an actor.</v>

3015
02:22:02.181 --> 02:22:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I did acting work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to.</v>

3016
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I had to do some serious love scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awkward and weird.</v>

3017
02:22:08.361 --> 02:22:10.790
<v Speaker 2>I bet man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was awkward and weird as it is</v>

3018
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:13.730
<v Speaker 2>being in a car with you for six hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to Turkey hunt.</v>

3019
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:14.930
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3020
02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:16.430
<v Speaker 2>We made time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3021
02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.560
<v Speaker 2>We did have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always have.</v>

3022
02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I will always haunt because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like white going has nothing to do with </v>

3023
02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:27.431
<v Speaker 2>killing the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it's I get to hang with you get </v>

3024
02:22:27.431 --> 02:22:27.431
<v Speaker 2>to be idiots and laugh.</v>

3025
02:22:27.431 --> 02:22:31.250
<v Speaker 3>It was like I was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a whole lot of dudes I'd </v>

3026
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.250
<v Speaker 3>asked to sleep in a tent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3027
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go.</v>

3028
02:22:31.470 --> 02:22:36.470
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go to someplace like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling my tv star famous comedian </v>

3029
02:22:36.470 --> 02:22:36.470
<v Speaker 3>friend going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3030
02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:39.330
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to sleep under the stars and</v>

3031
02:22:39.331 --> 02:22:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Napa Valley.</v>

3032
02:22:40.601 --> 02:22:44.010
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go shoot deer and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to eat them over a campfire.</v>

3033
02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:47.340
<v Speaker 3>You in Turkey hunting was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't give it away,</v>

3034
02:22:47.341 --> 02:22:50.760
<v Speaker 3>but I will say that I killed between </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero and 10 birds.</v>

3035
02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:52.500
<v Speaker 3>That's a good number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3036
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:55.230
<v Speaker 3>the Turkey hunting is very exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun,</v>

3037
02:22:55.290 --> 02:22:58.730
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only issue that I have,</v>

3038
02:22:58.731 --> 02:23:00.180
<v Speaker 3>and I don't really have an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3039
02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:05.600
<v Speaker 3>but the only thing that I would save,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it came to like preference of time that </v>

3040
02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:05.600
<v Speaker 3>I would spend hunting.</v>

3041
02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I would spend less time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey hunting and more time doing other</v>

3042
02:23:07.951 --> 02:23:11.880
<v Speaker 3>things because the fact that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get anything more than a Turkey.</v>

3043
02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stayed there all day.</v>

3044
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:19.260
<v Speaker 3>You shoot this Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got one Turkey and that's great.</v>

3045
02:23:19.261 --> 02:23:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean there'll be delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I haven't cooked it yet.</v>

3046
02:23:21.451 --> 02:23:26.451
<v Speaker 3>I've got it in the open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told everybody I killed a Turkey or </v>

3047
02:23:26.451 --> 02:23:26.451
<v Speaker 3>did you know this is where now I had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of it.</v>

3048
02:23:26.451 --> 02:23:27.550
<v Speaker 3>He put it on his instagram so I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3049
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:30.150
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a Turkey.</v>

3050
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:35.670
<v Speaker 3>We tasted some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We ate some Turkey and tasted like </v>

3051
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good,</v>

3052
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:39.860
<v Speaker 3>but the breast tasted identical Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the legs are like a little </v>

3053
02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:43.881
<v Speaker 3>tougher and the one that I got was </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently a good one to eat because it </v>

3054
02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:47.511
<v Speaker 3>was fairly young and those are like more</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 called Jake wasn't a top a jake and </v>

3055
02:23:48.091 --> 02:23:49.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't.</v>

3056
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3057
02:23:50.341 --> 02:23:52.080
<v Speaker 3>there's not that much food there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3058
02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:55.830
<v Speaker 3>it's like it'll feed a family and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you might have sandwiches the next</v>

3059
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:57.090
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot a deer,</v>

3060
02:23:57.091 --> 02:24:02.091
<v Speaker 3>like if you go out and you shoot a deer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you spend those those nights </v>

3061
02:24:02.091 --> 02:24:03.570
<v Speaker 3>sleeping in the tent in Montana and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're successful,</v>

3062
02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:08.290
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of come back with 50 or 60 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds of meat credible.</v>

3063
02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've got backstraps and loins </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Burger and you're making sausage out</v>

3064
02:24:13.381 --> 02:24:16.980
<v Speaker 3>of it and you got just butchering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just portraying it as a bitch.</v>

3065
02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:21.120
<v Speaker 3>We did it for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we butchered it and we joked around.</v>

3066
02:24:21.121 --> 02:24:25.350
<v Speaker 3>We had a great time or that Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if I shoot one of those that moves,</v>

3067
02:24:25.351 --> 02:24:27.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That moves forever.</v>

3068
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:32.030
<v Speaker 3>One of the greatest pictures I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen that picture and the fade or </v>

3069
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:34.950
<v Speaker 3>picture with kettlebells are the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures I use in my fantasy violence.</v>

3070
02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

3071
02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Listen this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3072
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:41.190
<v Speaker 3>that picture is like what it means to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat animals.</v>

3073
02:24:41.490 --> 02:24:44.610
<v Speaker 3>That is a moose leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much that way,</v>

3074
02:24:44.611 --> 02:24:48.210
<v Speaker 3>but it was heavy as 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well over 100 pounds.</v>

3075
02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Well over a hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the 900 pound Moose?</v>

3076
02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Which isn't even that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

3077
02:24:53.971 --> 02:24:58.230
<v Speaker 3>My phoner Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shot one that was about 1400 pounds.</v>

3078
02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Was much bigger than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's huge antlers.</v>

3079
02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:05.850
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that moves is going to feed me for a</v>

3080
02:25:05.850 --> 02:25:09.330
<v Speaker 3>year to come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

3081
02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have good cuts?</v>

3082
02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3083
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:13.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll let me show you how to cook it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not easy.</v>

3084
02:25:13.690 --> 02:25:15.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different than dear.</v>

3085
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:18.420
<v Speaker 3>This gladiator animal that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>

3086
02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:20.970
<v Speaker 3>like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you eat the meat,</v>

3087
02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have you over come over to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the house and you and I will sit down </v>

3088
02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:26.650
<v Speaker 3>and have a meal together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cook you a real moose steak.</v>

3089
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:28.300
<v Speaker 3>You're going to eat it and I'll bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one.</v>

3090
02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

3091
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:31.930
<v Speaker 3>because it makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a stimulant.</v>

3092
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:35.470
<v Speaker 3>There's so much energy in that meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3093
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I've done that with deer meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ate deer meat every day for 10 days.</v>

3094
02:25:39.671 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 3>I am telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not hokey.</v>

3095
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:44.300
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it.</v>

3096
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:46.180
<v Speaker 3>You get a rush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had an.</v>

3097
02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I had an extra kick in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my body.</v>

3098
02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:51.070
<v Speaker 3>It only makes sense if you look at their</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

3099
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:56.190
<v Speaker 3>Their flesh is so healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like their tissue is so rich and red and</v>

3100
02:25:56.231 --> 02:25:56.870
<v Speaker 3>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3101
02:25:57.070 --> 02:26:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Like you're dealing with an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy animal that is surviving against</v>

3102
02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:04.540
<v Speaker 3>really hardcore predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3103
02:26:04.541 --> 02:26:07.000
<v Speaker 3>it's running away from mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wolves.</v>

3104
02:26:07.001 --> 02:26:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Like this is existence for a moose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wolf packs.</v>

3105
02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:15.270
<v Speaker 3>If you make it from the time you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>calf to the time you're a full grown </v>

3106
02:26:15.270 --> 02:26:15.270
<v Speaker 3>moves.</v>

3107
02:26:15.270 --> 02:26:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We never started that picture that I </v>

3108

3109
02:26:22.531 --> 02:26:22.531
<v Speaker 3>apart by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

<v Speaker 3>even have a limit on how many wolves you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can kill because they're just so many.</v>

3117
02:26:40.001 --> 02:26:42.190
<v Speaker 3>They want you to kill wolves all day </v>
<v Speaker 3>dam.</v>

3118
02:26:42.250 --> 02:26:45.200
<v Speaker 3>They want you to set up bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever you want.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's such a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just such a motherfucker and </v>

3121
02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:50.670
<v Speaker 3>The guy that I lived up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3122
02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:52.540
<v Speaker 3>the state of displays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother that lives up there,</v>

3123
02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:56.830
<v Speaker 3>he's neighbor lost a cow to a wolf.</v>

3124
02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:57.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were,</v>

3125
02:26:57.611 --> 02:27:00.400
<v Speaker 3>when we were in Napa vow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in Napa Valley,</v>

3126
02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.740
<v Speaker 3>the farmers I was talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to keep emos emos like,</v>

3127
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:09.870
<v Speaker 3>which are miniature ostriches and lambs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said the mountain lions wreak havoc.</v>

3128
02:27:10.751 --> 02:27:14.320
<v Speaker 3>The mountain lion would come in and pull</v>
<v Speaker 3>those emails over the fence,</v>

3129
02:27:14.321 --> 02:27:19.321
<v Speaker 3>the seven foot fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just find feathers on the top </v>

3130
02:27:19.321 --> 02:27:22.921
<v Speaker 3>of the fence that goes our emo and lambs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just eat the shit out of land where </v>

3131
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:24.970
<v Speaker 3>the place where you and I were standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in.</v>

3132
02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:26.240
<v Speaker 3>That's where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3133
02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:31.260
<v Speaker 3>The place where you and I were staying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they they've lost all their sheep to </v>

3134
02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:31.260
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions,</v>

3135
02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:36.060
<v Speaker 3>this farm that we were at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they had all these cows and shit </v>

3136
02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:38.521
<v Speaker 3>and they think about you have to survive</v>
<v Speaker 3>the winter and a mountain lion and </v>

3137
02:27:38.521 --> 02:27:40.180
<v Speaker 3>wolves or you'll start hating mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>lions and wolves content.</v>

3138
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:43.150
<v Speaker 3>There's a totally different idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I have about them.</v>

3139
02:27:43.151 --> 02:27:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at a wolf,</v>

3140
02:27:44.441 --> 02:27:45.550
<v Speaker 3>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a dog.</v>

3141
02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:47.710
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a dog to them.</v>

3142
02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:50.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a danger of starvation thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that starvation.</v>

3143
02:27:50.291 --> 02:27:55.291
<v Speaker 3>It's a dangerous fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to find when you're in the </v>

3144
02:27:55.291 --> 02:27:55.291
<v Speaker 3>frontier and we'll take care of all your</v>
<v Speaker 3>livestock.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been.</v>

3148
02:28:00.041 --> 02:28:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found the pictures.</v>

3149
02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:06.060
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't been that long ago that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings really had to worry about wolves.</v>

3150
02:28:06.251 --> 02:28:09.340
<v Speaker 3>That's why those big bad wolf and all </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what we're found.</v>

3153
02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:18.300
<v Speaker 3>That was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had gotten there probably the night </v>

<v Speaker 1>finish off the rest or they were just </v>

3167
02:28:46.301 --> 02:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>full and they were going to go somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else and get something else,</v>

3168

02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3178
02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:14.570
<v Speaker 1>we're the ones who have to hear them </v>
<v Speaker 1>howl and you know,</v>

3179
02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and wonder how many of them there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and they kill your livestock </v>

3180
02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and they kill your dogs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different perspective.</v>

3181
02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:24.050
<v Speaker 1>They're wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the movies,</v>

3182
02:29:24.051 --> 02:29:26.960
<v Speaker 1>like Little Red Riding Hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look out little girl.</v>

3183
02:29:26.961 --> 02:29:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Don't go off in the woods alone because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's wolves out there too.</v>

3184
02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:33.430
<v Speaker 1>They're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know.</v>

3185
02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>What's our next Honda we're going to on </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know we could pay current.</v>

3186
02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:43.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I was thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking we should go go caribou </v>

3187
02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:44.180
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>

3188
02:29:44.390 --> 02:29:47.860
<v Speaker 1>We'll call Alaska us too cold to going </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3189
02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:49.850
<v Speaker 1>You're going in August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go then.</v>

3190
02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they migrate in August.</v>

3191
02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about before that?</v>

3192
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:56.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure someone to kill a pig up.</v>

3193
02:29:56.451 --> 02:29:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>

3194
02:29:57.231 --> 02:29:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You're violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you?</v>

3195
02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3196
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I need some pig and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>

3197
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I still have some from the pig I shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>

3198
02:30:03.570 --> 02:30:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll cook some.</v>

3199
02:30:04.530 --> 02:30:08.900
<v Speaker 1>At the House I made a ham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you still have all my hunting</v>

3200
02:30:08.901 --> 02:30:10.470

<v Speaker 1>Some of you.</v>

3201
02:30:11.570 --> 02:30:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I made a ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's us were Turkey hunting.</v>

3202
02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Look if you look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I made this ham that I a slow,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I brightened it for like four or five </v>

3205
02:30:25.481 --> 02:30:26.390
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chase Brian it like he'll take ice,</v>

3206
02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:30.050
<v Speaker 1>put it in a cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take this bronx mostly like salt and</v>

3207
02:30:30.051 --> 02:30:35.051
<v Speaker 1>sugar and some spices and you dunk this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ham in there and then surround </v>

3208
02:30:35.091 --> 02:30:38.990
<v Speaker 1>everything with ice and put it in like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeti cooler and then look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing,</v>

3213
02:30:48.020 --> 02:30:50.900
<v Speaker 1>but I do know how to smoke me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew how to grill steaks.</v>

3220
02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I always.</v>

3223
02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:16.660

<v Speaker 1>Is that boosie?</v>

3224
02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Ribeye steak.</v>

3225
02:31:17.650 --> 02:31:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a regular steak.</v>

3226
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I got a cowboy cut a big thick.</v>

3227
02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It was probably like maybe three inches </v>
<v Speaker 1>thick.</v>

3228
02:31:25.050 --> 02:31:29.700
<v Speaker 1>At least one to two and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a fat thick one where I had</v>

3229
02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:31.860
<v Speaker 1>to use a thermometer to cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3230
02:31:31.861 --> 02:31:33.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cook it on the outside.</v>

3231
02:31:33.690 --> 02:31:36.480
<v Speaker 1>You see are the outside on these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Grill grates.</v>

3232
02:31:36.810 --> 02:31:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I gotta I gotTa show you the smoker I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

3233
02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a yoder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3234
02:31:41.041 --> 02:31:41.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3235
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:46.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it uses direct heat as well as indirect </v>

3236
02:31:46.510 --> 02:31:46.510
<v Speaker 1>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen those things?</v>

3237
02:31:46.510 --> 02:31:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Those pellet smokers know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3238
02:31:47.281 --> 02:31:52.281
<v Speaker 1>this one you can sear it on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you move it over to the other side </v>

3239
02:31:52.281 --> 02:31:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and then you just leave the temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you want it.</v>

3240
02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:57.321
<v Speaker 1>For me it was like 400 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I dropped it down to 400 degrees and </v>

3241
02:31:57.321 --> 02:31:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I have a thermometer in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tells me when the temperature,</v>

3242
02:31:58.081 --> 02:32:01.590
<v Speaker 1>the internal temperature hits like 1:25</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I watch it carefully.</v>

3243
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Took it to be about 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>

3244
02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:05.760
<v Speaker 1>pop that bitch out and let it sit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>roasting it.</v>

3245
02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You're starting off grilling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're starting enough grilling.</v>

3246
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It's direct fire like fire literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>below these greats.</v>

3247
02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see are the shit out of it.</v>

3248
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to burn it,</v>

3249
02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:20.610
<v Speaker 1>but you want to sear it for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending upon the thickness of the meat</v>

3250
02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:22.510
<v Speaker 1>and the temperature that you're searing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3251
02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it for more than like two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half minutes aside and I just really </v>

3252
02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:28.650
<v Speaker 1>just like cooked the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3253
02:32:28.651 --> 02:32:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're burning off any possible bacteria</v>

3254
02:32:31.411 --> 02:32:33.720
<v Speaker 1>that's on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a nice crust and a good,</v>

3255
02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:37.530
<v Speaker 1>like a delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like top area of it where it's like real</v>

3256
02:32:37.531 --> 02:32:42.531
<v Speaker 1>crispy and you got like kosher salt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>black pepper and a little bit of garlic </v>

3257
02:32:42.531 --> 02:32:42.720
<v Speaker 1>powder.</v>

3258
02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I mix on there and I let it sit for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour before I put it on the grill.</v>

3259
02:32:46.020 --> 02:32:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It's an art form to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It magnifies.</v>

3260
02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It is because like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put post pictures of it because I like</v>

3261
02:32:50.521 --> 02:32:51.540
<v Speaker 1>when other people do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3262
02:32:51.880 --> 02:32:54.180
<v Speaker 1>like looking at people's instagrams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they're making.</v>

3263
02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father in law can cook the greatest </v>

3264
02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:02.211
<v Speaker 1>stakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put Hughes's hickory chips and he </v>

3265
02:33:02.211 --> 02:33:04.260
<v Speaker 1>smokes it that way on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's just a master with a grill.</v>

3266
02:33:04.330 --> 02:33:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I try to replicate replicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it.</v>

3267
02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:08.580
<v Speaker 1>There's two different styles of cooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>steaks.</v>

3268
02:33:08.581 --> 02:33:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Like some people like the Argentine </v>
<v Speaker 1>style,</v>

3269
02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:13.920
<v Speaker 1>which is like a slow grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slow and low.</v>

3270
02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:18.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll cook like a steak slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like my meat to be a little raw </v>

3271
02:33:18.980 --> 02:33:19.310
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like rare.</v>

3272
02:33:19.410 --> 02:33:20.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean they don't.</v>

3273
02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean they can certainly still cook it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare.</v>

3274
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:24.680
<v Speaker 1>They just cook it at a low temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like,</v>

3275
02:33:25.330 --> 02:33:27.360
<v Speaker 1>like American style grilling a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3276
02:33:27.361 --> 02:33:32.361
<v Speaker 1>you see that stake hit the thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip it or you move it a little and then</v>

3277
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you flip it and then you push it off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side and you always put the lid on </v>

3278
02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:41.631
<v Speaker 1>it and you let it rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to let it sit like you </v>

3279
02:33:41.631 --> 02:33:44.601
<v Speaker 1>grill the top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unless it's a really thin steak </v>

3280
02:33:44.601 --> 02:33:45.090
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to really get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center where you want it.</v>

3281
02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It'll be really rare in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you do is you put it like if you</v>

3282
02:33:47.941 --> 02:33:49.300
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3283
02:33:49.350 --> 02:33:52.260
<v Speaker 1>like either one of those Weber's or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a Kamado,</v>

3284
02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you put a top layer lever to it so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heat is not really underneath and </v>

3285
02:33:57.590 --> 02:34:02.031
<v Speaker 1>anymore cooking it from the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cooking all around it and then you </v>

3286
02:34:02.031 --> 02:34:05.151
<v Speaker 1>put it on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close the lid and it'll drop down like </v>

3287
02:34:05.151 --> 02:34:05.151
<v Speaker 1>maybe 350 degrees or somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3288
02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And then you cook it slowly for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

3289
02:34:07.561 --> 02:34:09.930
<v Speaker 1>like depending upon the thickness of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>

3290
02:34:09.931 --> 02:34:14.931
<v Speaker 1>I don't usually like to go more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes and then I pull it off of </v>

3291
02:34:14.931 --> 02:34:17.691
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I've done is I've seen her the </v>

3292
02:34:17.691 --> 02:34:18.310
<v Speaker 1>shit out of the outside with like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd flames and a hot grill</v>

3293
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:22.420
<v Speaker 2>grate and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is just like really cooking.</v>

3294
02:34:22.421 --> 02:34:25.690
<v Speaker 2>The outside of it would then slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking it after that.</v>

3295
02:34:25.691 --> 02:34:27.330
<v Speaker 2>So you get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it all kinds of stuff.</v>

3296
02:34:27.331 --> 02:34:28.480
<v Speaker 2>On the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

3297
02:34:28.481 --> 02:34:33.481
<v Speaker 2>I had a big stake in Utah where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put it in a plastic bag and they </v>

3298
02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:35.370
<v Speaker 2>boil it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3299
02:34:35.371 --> 02:34:38.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a new thing that God damn.</v>

3300
02:34:38.261 --> 02:34:43.261
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that snake river farms </v>

3301
02:34:43.261 --> 02:34:43.261
<v Speaker 2>is really popular right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

3302
02:34:43.261 --> 02:34:47.631
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have new ones that they sell that </v>

3303
02:34:47.631 --> 02:34:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you put like you put a pot of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3304
02:34:48.191 --> 02:34:52.090
<v Speaker 2>and then you stick this heater element </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it and it cooks it for you.</v>

3305
02:34:52.091 --> 02:34:53.350
<v Speaker 2>You just sit it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

3306
02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:55.960
<v Speaker 2>on the counter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the sitter on your stove,</v>

3307
02:34:55.961 --> 02:34:57.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the stove that took cooking</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3308
02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:01.180
<v Speaker 2>It's this device that you have in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water so it'll keep the water steady.</v>

3309
02:35:01.210 --> 02:35:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Hundred and 35 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like medium,</v>

3310
02:35:03.250 --> 02:35:08.250
<v Speaker 2>medium rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would just do that and it would </v>

3311
02:35:08.250 --> 02:35:08.250
<v Speaker 2>cook it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't fuck it up.</v>

3312
02:35:08.250 --> 02:35:12.991
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't overcook and then you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they cook the outside of it with </v>

3313
02:35:12.991 --> 02:35:13.900
<v Speaker 2>like a torch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3314
02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I could take a butane torch and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>crispy sear or the outside of it and </v>

3315
02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:18.960
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3316
02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I've had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

3317
02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that shit though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a wagon was sent to me from snake </v>

3318
02:35:26.651 --> 02:35:29.130
<v Speaker 2>river farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which apparently like I went to Mastro's</v>

3319
02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:29.680
<v Speaker 2>and God goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3320
02:35:29.681 --> 02:35:32.890
<v Speaker 2>snake river farms is the best dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they do there.</v>

3321
02:35:32.891 --> 02:35:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they do at those cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3322
02:35:34.151 --> 02:35:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you is the best steak.</v>

3323
02:35:36.470 --> 02:35:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better than Venice spending </v>

3324
02:35:41.470 --> 02:35:43.200
<v Speaker 2>anything you might like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different things that I like because </v>

3325
02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried that Wagyu.</v>

3326
02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I've given a bunch of tries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had coby fatty tissue,</v>

3327
02:35:45.601 --> 02:35:49.000
<v Speaker 2>fatty I liked about this is what I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like that,</v>

3328
02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:52.540
<v Speaker 2>that I'm what the fuck tri tip that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

3329
02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I like lean to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of a lean guy.</v>

3330
02:35:54.671 --> 02:35:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a lot of fat and this was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an exception.</v>

3331
02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're just the preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chef just nailed it now because they</v>

3332
02:36:01.151 --> 02:36:06.151
<v Speaker 2>sent me my own stakes and I just cooked </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and fucking butter and I was just </v>

3333
02:36:06.151 --> 02:36:07.560
<v Speaker 2>still like the best steak I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3334
02:36:07.561 --> 02:36:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it another shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had it before.</v>

3335
02:36:09.401 --> 02:36:10.760
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was eating.</v>

3336
02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll call them the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I know the guy.</v>

3337
02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll have him send you some steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I was eating a bedridden </v>

3338
02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:18.790
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you took a cow stuff,</v>

3339
02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:23.820
<v Speaker 2>froot loops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck fat face and getting drunk every </v>

3340
02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:23.820
<v Speaker 2>night and then killed it.</v>

3341
02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious what you think of this snake</v>
<v Speaker 2>rivers.</v>

3342
02:36:24.350 --> 02:36:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try and have it to a size.</v>

3343
02:36:25.691 --> 02:36:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Apparently there are these day are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3344
02:36:27.970 --> 02:36:31.540
<v Speaker 2>there's other places that do Wagyu and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the snake river farms.</v>

3345
02:36:31.541 --> 02:36:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody who's in the,</v>

3346
02:36:32.890 --> 02:36:33.910
<v Speaker 2>they all say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

3347
02:36:34.010 --> 02:36:37.380
<v Speaker 2>that's the Cadillac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Mercedes Ferrari of snakes.</v>

3348
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another Japanese invention,</v>

3349
02:36:39.461 --> 02:36:41.620
<v Speaker 2>those slick bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin with peer,</v>

3350
02:36:41.621 --> 02:36:43.540
<v Speaker 2>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do all kinds of weird shit with</v>

3351
02:36:43.541 --> 02:36:45.040
<v Speaker 2>the cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't let it move.</v>

3352
02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole culture,</v>

3353
02:36:47.171 --> 02:36:52.171
<v Speaker 2>when you think about one small island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just thinking about what they did to </v>

3354
02:36:52.171 --> 02:36:54.721
<v Speaker 2>revolutionize the car industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made cars reliable with insane,</v>

3355
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:57.200
<v Speaker 2>with insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3356
02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:02.400
<v Speaker 2>cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll give you an example with fully </v>

3357
02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:02.400
<v Speaker 2>contemplated a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is back in the day.</v>

3358
02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:04.780
<v Speaker 2>This was 20 years ago in twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

3359
02:37:04.781 --> 02:37:09.781
<v Speaker 2>They could start from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from when they started with the one </v>

3360
02:37:09.781 --> 02:37:13.590
<v Speaker 2>piece that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to put the car together </v>

3361
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.590
<v Speaker 2>on the assembly line.</v>

3362
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:15.750
<v Speaker 2>It took five minutes to assemble an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire Toyota dollars.</v>

3363
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:20.770
<v Speaker 2>You take 10 guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just make sure the bolts are tightened </v>

3364
02:37:20.770 --> 02:37:20.770
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck man,</v>

3365
02:37:20.770 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>don't rush my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No bolts on five minutes.</v>

3366
02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:26.450
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a little quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3367
02:37:26.451 --> 02:37:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

3368
02:37:28.041 --> 02:37:33.041
<v Speaker 2>but they have it down to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always say that Japan was so </v>

3369
02:37:33.041 --> 02:37:36.881
<v Speaker 2>heavily influenced by one factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people in a very small area and</v>

3370
02:37:37.671 --> 02:37:42.671
<v Speaker 2>it required a great deal of cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more importantly because of </v>

3371
02:37:43.161 --> 02:37:44.820
<v Speaker 2>typhoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

3372
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:49.950
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their architecture was made from rice </v>

3373
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:51.650
<v Speaker 2>because you didn't want a wind to blow </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone on you and die.</v>

3374
02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:53.730
<v Speaker 2>So the reason that the origami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3375
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:55.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like sliding glass doors and I</v>

3376
02:37:55.821 --> 02:37:57.160
<v Speaker 2>mean paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of their,</v>

3377
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:59.900
<v Speaker 2>their houses were made if the inside was</v>
<v Speaker 2>made of paper.</v>

3378
02:37:59.901 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem with that is when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have walls that separate you,</v>

3379
02:38:03.111 --> 02:38:08.111
<v Speaker 2>that are made of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hear what goes on in the room </v>

3380
02:38:08.111 --> 02:38:10.640
<v Speaker 2>next to you and if you have a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking or whatever,</v>

3381
02:38:10.641 --> 02:38:14.870
<v Speaker 2>or crying or arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're privy to their business.</v>

3382
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:20.290
<v Speaker 2>And what that did was they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to run a society like </v>

3383
02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:20.290
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is weird.</v>

3384
02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:20.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3385
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he's listening to me and then I'm</v>

3386
02:38:23.811 --> 02:38:28.811
<v Speaker 2>listening to him and what a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social scientists talk about is this </v>

3387
02:38:28.811 --> 02:38:32.351
<v Speaker 2>idea that the Japanese got super good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>actively not hearing things they're not </v>

3388
02:38:33.921 --> 02:38:37.680
<v Speaker 2>supposed to and it was like this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>social contract where,</v>

3389
02:38:37.740 --> 02:38:42.740
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never mentioned that you heard </v>

3390
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:42.740
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>

3391
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you didn't even gossip because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't hear it.</v>

3392
02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

3393
02:38:44.980 --> 02:38:46.180
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

3394
02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:49.810
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

3395
02:38:50.170 --> 02:38:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Not Listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not listening.</v>

3396
02:38:51.970 --> 02:38:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I am jacking off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not listening.</v>

3397
02:38:53.531 --> 02:38:58.531
<v Speaker 2>What a bizarre culture that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhibited so many unique traits and </v>

3398
02:38:59.771 --> 02:39:02.890
<v Speaker 2>characteristics and at so many unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengths.</v>

3399
02:39:03.490 --> 02:39:04.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

3400
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:10.110
<v Speaker 2>if you think about their contributions </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to martial arts alone for one </v>

3401
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:10.690
<v Speaker 2>island like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unprecedented.</v>

3402
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:12.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other island,</v>

3403
02:39:12.161 --> 02:39:17.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean Brazil is obviously an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and there they had a massive </v>

3404
02:39:17.161 --> 02:39:19.150
<v Speaker 2>influence on as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland is a small country.</v>

3405
02:39:19.151 --> 02:39:24.151
<v Speaker 2>They had a massive influence on </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing and Muay Thai and on the </v>

3406
02:39:24.401 --> 02:39:27.260
<v Speaker 2>economy of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of,</v>

3407
02:39:27.610 --> 02:39:32.610
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that day they're an economic </v>

3408
02:39:32.610 --> 02:39:35.551
<v Speaker 2>powerhouse responsible for setting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>shop in Africa and and I believe in a </v>

3409
02:39:36.401 --> 02:39:41.401
<v Speaker 2>place called New York and that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the kit there,</v>

3410
02:39:44.460 --> 02:39:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I was just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was confused.</v>

3411
02:39:47.050 --> 02:39:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Hallmark.</v>

3412
02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:50.900
<v Speaker 2>The Netherlands is the same as </v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteer.</v>

3413
02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that area.</v>

3414
02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You can fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a Dane.</v>

3415
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:55.760
<v Speaker 2>You're from Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean now you.</v>

3416
02:39:55.950 --> 02:39:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are You Dutch?</v>

3417
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:59.440
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history from the Netherlands.</v>

3418
02:39:59.441 --> 02:40:00.900
<v Speaker 2>You're Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're here from how I.</v>

3419
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:05.910
<v Speaker 2>it's always confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also figured out we'd and </v>

3420
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.910
<v Speaker 2>hookers a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're great.</v>

3421
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:06.940
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3422
02:40:06.941 --> 02:40:11.941
<v Speaker 2>let's just like how about you just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested and do whatever you want to do </v>

3423
02:40:11.941 --> 02:40:15.661
<v Speaker 2>and the only issue with the Japanese is </v>
<v Speaker 2>their challenge has always been </v>

3424
02:40:15.661 --> 02:40:15.661
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>

3425
02:40:15.661 --> 02:40:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Like they're really good at mimicry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>making things better,</v>

3426
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but as far as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because of </v>

3427
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:24.891
<v Speaker 1>the way their society is structured so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you are someone who comes up </v>

3428
02:40:24.891 --> 02:40:25.410
<v Speaker 1>with a better way to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your boss,</v>

3429
02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:29.070
<v Speaker 1>your boss would lose face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why a lot of things stayed</v>

3430
02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:31.440
<v Speaker 1>rather stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they were good.</v>

3431
02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It was very hard for them to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up with the in.</v>

3432
02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:37.530
<v Speaker 1>So not as much innovation comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

3433
02:40:37.531 --> 02:40:40.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't really have a silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we do.</v>

3434
02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

3435
02:40:41.261 --> 02:40:46.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting way of describing </v>

3436
02:40:46.261 --> 02:40:48.981
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a boss and you go out to </v>

3437
02:40:48.981 --> 02:40:50.460
<v Speaker 1>drink the boss strings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a higher higher caliber whiskey than you</v>

3438
02:40:50.461 --> 02:40:55.461
<v Speaker 1>do really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutty Sark and you'll drink something </v>

3439
02:40:55.461 --> 02:40:56.580
<v Speaker 1>shithead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give up the good booze son.</v>

3440
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.230
<v Speaker 1>This man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on Bro,</v>

3441
02:40:58.231 --> 02:40:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you make more money.</v>

3442
02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:01.430
<v Speaker 1>He's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

3443
02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:03.300
<v Speaker 1>we work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be friends here.</v>

3444
02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:09.200
<v Speaker 1>And also very chauvinistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they did some amazing improvements </v>

3445
02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:13.701
<v Speaker 1>on existing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what their unique </v>

3446
02:41:13.701 --> 02:41:14.070
<v Speaker 1>characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their unique traits,</v>

3447
02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:18.480
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>automobile electronics,</v>

3448
02:41:18.481 --> 02:41:23.481
<v Speaker 1>phonics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the NSX forced Ferrari and Porsche </v>

3449
02:41:23.481 --> 02:41:27.921
<v Speaker 1>to change the way they were making cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they came out with this fucking </v>

3450
02:41:27.921 --> 02:41:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Nsx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like 91 or 92 was the </v>

3451
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:34.581
<v Speaker 1>first NSX and it was basically like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super evolved sports car for the time it</v>

3452
02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:40.380
<v Speaker 1>like had these ridiculous things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd built into it like baffles in the</v>

3453
02:41:40.381 --> 02:41:44.610
<v Speaker 1>fuel lines to make sure that the weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>always stayed completely central.</v>

3454
02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Like they wanted to have like a pure 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 50 weight balance.</v>

3455
02:41:47.851 --> 02:41:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's a mid engine car so the engine </v>
<v Speaker 1>is behind the passenger seat.</v>

3456
02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:57.020
<v Speaker 1>All these unique innovations to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspension geometry and the way it </v>

3457
02:41:57.020 --> 02:41:59.760
<v Speaker 1>handled was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was on rails man.</v>

3458
02:42:00.030 --> 02:42:02.730
<v Speaker 1>And it was not even a high horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

3459
02:42:02.731 --> 02:42:07.731
<v Speaker 1>It was like 275.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think initially maybe two to 90 </v>

3460
02:42:07.731 --> 02:42:10.490
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of its production line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like that speed.</v>

3461
02:42:10.530 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It was just bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's all aluminum?</v>

3462
02:42:14.250 --> 02:42:19.250
<v Speaker 1>No one had ever done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one had ever made an all aluminum </v>

3463
02:42:19.250 --> 02:42:22.041
<v Speaker 1>sports car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting in that car with you </v>

3464
02:42:22.041 --> 02:42:24.230
<v Speaker 1>when you first got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So amazing and you were just like you </v>

3465
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:27.051
<v Speaker 1>were telling me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The engineering is unprecedented and </v>

3466
02:42:27.051 --> 02:42:29.190
<v Speaker 1>they lost money on every one they sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make money on that car.</v>

3467
02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes a flagship car just to show </v>

3468
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:34.250
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3469
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:36.180
<v Speaker 1>not only are we going to make something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better than any of your shit.</v>

3470
02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to break down ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks awesome and we're going to lose</v>

3471
02:42:42.331 --> 02:42:43.860
<v Speaker 1>money selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

3472
02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shut your mouth.</v>

3473
02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they kind of do that with the Nissan</v>

3474
02:42:49.531 --> 02:42:51.570
<v Speaker 1>does that now with this thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>GTR.</v>

3475
02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:53.340
<v Speaker 1>They have this car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that GTR.</v>

3476
02:42:53.341 --> 02:42:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It's actually more expensive now than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be for awhile.</v>

3477
02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:57.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like they were barely breaking even</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>

3478
02:42:57.151 --> 02:43:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but I think now they realize that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a demand that it's.</v>

3479
02:43:00.211 --> 02:43:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of charge more money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've continued to innovate it.</v>

3480
02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:05.520
<v Speaker 1>They continue to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Samurai sword.</v>

3481
02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:10.550
<v Speaker 1>They built the Samurai sword and I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say the NSX came out like 2007 or </v>

3482
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.550
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be off,</v>

3483
02:43:10.770 --> 02:43:14.500
<v Speaker 1>but that time they've just made a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>version every year.</v>

3484
02:43:14.650 --> 02:43:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

3485
02:43:16.270 --> 02:43:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like now.</v>

3486
02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and 15 cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hundred and something thousand,</v>

3487
02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:26.940
<v Speaker 1>but it is a fucking spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3488
02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I rented one of those when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin at budget know Hertz.</v>

3489
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Hertz rent a car will let you run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking NSX.</v>

3490
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I rented an Nsx and me and the </v>

3491
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Hinchcliffe machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking tooling around.</v>

3492
02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:44.860
<v Speaker 1>That thing is the fastest fucking thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever done look like.</v>

3493
02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:46.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a,</v>

3494
02:43:47.170 --> 02:43:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an understated sports car </v>

3495
02:43:52.170 --> 02:43:52.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not a GTR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3496
02:43:52.170 --> 02:43:53.530
<v Speaker 1>That's got different tale laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's got.</v>

3497
02:43:53.531 --> 02:43:55.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just unique tail lights.</v>

3498
02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real one?</v>

3499
02:43:58.750 --> 02:44:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the real tail lights or go back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous image that you had.</v>

3500
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the real tail lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really cool looking.</v>

3501
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:07.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a spaceship man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it handles,</v>

3502
02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:10.690
<v Speaker 1>it's all like the thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like about it.</v>

3503
02:44:10.990 --> 02:44:12.760
<v Speaker 1>The people that don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people love it,</v>

3504
02:44:12.910 --> 02:44:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that people are a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>perturbed about it.</v>

3505
02:44:15.101 --> 02:44:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>

3506
02:44:16.290 --> 02:44:21.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the Nissan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking we were looking at an </v>

3507
02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Acura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a new ACURA NSX is coming</v>

3508
02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:22.490
<v Speaker 1>out as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably won't be,</v>

3509
02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:27.500
<v Speaker 1>but go back to that image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rear end image that you just show </v>

3510
02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:27.500
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking thing.</v>

3511
02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean that might as well be in star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

3512
02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking the way it's built </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that is aerodynamics.</v>

3513
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Like all that shit you see around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back end,</v>

3514
02:44:35.260 --> 02:44:36.610
<v Speaker 1>all that shit around the pipes.</v>

3515
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:41.790
<v Speaker 1>That's all designed for downforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extreme amounts of downtown Florence is </v>

3516
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.790
<v Speaker 1>super important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3517
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that's why it has that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tailoring it in the back of it.</v>

3518
02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:48.280
<v Speaker 1>That's all about keeping the ass end </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because this thing has such fucking</v>

3519
02:44:48.281 --> 02:44:51.970
<v Speaker 1>insane power that sometimes they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch a flight.</v>

3520
02:44:52.770 --> 02:44:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one of the nerves have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>

3521
02:44:56.170 --> 02:44:57.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wing,</v>

3522
02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:58.540
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3523
02:44:58.690 --> 02:44:59.830
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

3524
02:44:59.831 --> 02:45:04.831
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they get back end heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the front end comes off the </v>

3525
02:45:04.831 --> 02:45:05.950
<v Speaker 1>ground and they go flying through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

3526
02:45:06.350 --> 02:45:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened recently at the nurburgring.</v>

3527
02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:12.520
<v Speaker 1>So Nurburgring look up this gtr crash at</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurburgring.</v>

3528
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:16.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy thing to watch because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize this is not just a crash.</v>

3529
02:45:16.271 --> 02:45:21.271
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy that has no control of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>car because the cars wheels aren't </v>

3530
02:45:21.271 --> 02:45:21.910
<v Speaker 1>touching the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's flying.</v>

3531
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:25.290
<v Speaker 1>It's crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Grad.</v>

3532
02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let go to videos.</v>

3533
02:45:27.490 --> 02:45:29.110
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

3534
02:45:29.111 --> 02:45:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Watch this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3535
02:45:30.221 --> 02:45:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this shit.</v>

3536
02:45:32.890 --> 02:45:33.730
<v Speaker 1>This hurts my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3537
02:45:33.970 --> 02:45:38.960
<v Speaker 1>my anticipation hurts my adrenal glands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa.</v>

3538
02:45:38.961 --> 02:45:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3539
02:45:39.491 --> 02:45:40.390
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3540
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Look washed out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going around the corner.</v>

3541
02:45:43.450 --> 02:45:45.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what it kills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many died man.</v>

3542
02:45:45.070 --> 02:45:46.120
<v Speaker 1>So he died in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3543
02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:48.460
<v Speaker 1>they did not hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was hit by the car.</v>

3544
02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's coming over the hill and it just </v>

3545
02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:53.600
<v Speaker 1>catches flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

3546
02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:56.620
<v Speaker 1>he's scraping along the back bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just skipping through the air.</v>

3547
02:45:57.190 --> 02:46:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The front end came so far off the ground</v>

3548
02:46:02.260 --> 02:46:06.100
<v Speaker 1>that the car literally was bumper to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

3549
02:46:06.101 --> 02:46:11.101
<v Speaker 1>Like look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bumpers on the ground to the wind </v>

3550
02:46:11.101 --> 02:46:11.101
<v Speaker 1>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fast is he?</v>

3551
02:46:11.101 --> 02:46:12.650
<v Speaker 1>The wheel actually caught it from going </v>
<v Speaker 1>upside down.</v>

3552
02:46:12.651 --> 02:46:14.660
<v Speaker 1>It goes back forward again and it flips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3553
02:46:14.661 --> 02:46:17.030
<v Speaker 1>he's going ridiculously fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what the problem was.</v>

3554
02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:20.510
<v Speaker 1>The problem was he lost control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not about going fast.</v>

3555
02:46:20.511 --> 02:46:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It's about when do you go fast and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you slow down and you got to know,</v>

3556
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:26.810
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a circuit.</v>

3557
02:46:26.811 --> 02:46:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Like the Nurburgring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nuremberg ring is the most famous of</v>

3558
02:46:29.901 --> 02:46:33.350
<v Speaker 1>all circuits when it comes to testing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car's lap time.</v>

3559
02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Like if you can get a really fast lap </v>
<v Speaker 1>times the nurburgring,</v>

3560
02:46:36.111 --> 02:46:41.111
<v Speaker 1>it's worth millions of dollars because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that car will be the new king of the </v>

3561
02:46:41.111 --> 02:46:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg ring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The GCR was like,</v>

3562
02:46:41.211 --> 02:46:46.211
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the best production cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of lap times the fastest for </v>

3563
02:46:46.211 --> 02:46:51.011
<v Speaker 1>the longest time was a corvette Zr one </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking insane 650 horsepower </v>

3564
02:46:52.821 --> 02:46:54.260
<v Speaker 1>corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now the new corvette,</v>

3565
02:46:54.261 --> 02:46:59.261
<v Speaker 1>z o six is even faster than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every year everyone's trying to get </v>

3566
02:46:59.261 --> 02:47:01.910
<v Speaker 1>a faster lap time on that track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem with that track,</v>

3567
02:47:01.911 --> 02:47:06.911
<v Speaker 1>that track sort of mimics the real world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a sense that it's not like a flat </v>

3568
02:47:06.911 --> 02:47:06.911
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

3569
02:47:06.911 --> 02:47:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a flat circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nascar thing,</v>

3570
02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but there's ups and downs and twists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns.</v>

3571
02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.730
<v Speaker 1>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're changing levels,</v>

3572
02:47:13.731 --> 02:47:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you're going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you get from a real.</v>

3573
02:47:16.371 --> 02:47:21.371
<v Speaker 1>It's a real test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real test of the car's ability in </v>

3574
02:47:21.371 --> 02:47:23.951
<v Speaker 1>the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is particularly disturbing </v>

3575
02:47:23.951 --> 02:47:26.470
<v Speaker 1>because that guy's coming off that hill </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that with the kind of power that a </v>

3576
02:47:26.470 --> 02:47:29.921
<v Speaker 1>real gtr that you could buy in a store </v>
<v Speaker 1>has and he's going flying through the </v>

3577
02:47:29.921 --> 02:47:31.910
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to stop and think,</v>

3578
02:47:32.090 --> 02:47:34.210
<v Speaker 1>look how beautiful that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3579
02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:37.550
<v Speaker 1>is that where the crash took place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the nerve again.</v>

3580
02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how beautiful it is around it.</v>

3581
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:45.910
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen when people stand too </v>

3582
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.910
<v Speaker 1>close to car races like that with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

3583
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Other guys who are golf watching golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the guy tees off and what are they?</v>

3584
02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Right in the line of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You as a good point this,</v>

3585
02:47:52.221 --> 02:47:53.180
<v Speaker 1>especially though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3586
02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Look how beautiful that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3587
02:47:55.700 --> 02:47:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You're flying around next to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable countryside,</v>

3588
02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:04.240
<v Speaker 1>so gorgeous parts of Germany and parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Switzerland and parts of France that </v>

3589
02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:05.060
<v Speaker 1>are just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that blow your mind.</v>

3590
02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Then you go into these little towns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been there for a thousand years.</v>

3591
02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:13.960
<v Speaker 1>The issue with this racetrack though </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently is that a lot of inclement </v>

3592
02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:16.730
<v Speaker 1>weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'll watch a bunch of labs,</v>

3593
02:48:16.731 --> 02:48:19.490
<v Speaker 1>they'll do what's raining out and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the UK,</v>

3594
02:48:19.491 --> 02:48:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like top gear.</v>

3595
02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:23.180
<v Speaker 1>One of the hilarious things about top </v>
<v Speaker 1>gear,</v>

3596
02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:28.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that so often they're testing cars </v>

3597
02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:31.871
<v Speaker 1>and it's raining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Chris Harris I've had on the </v>

3598
02:48:31.871 --> 02:48:33.020
<v Speaker 1>podcast before is like one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite automotive journalists.</v>

3599
02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:37.040
<v Speaker 1>So many times he's driving a car and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's raining out really.</v>

3600
02:48:37.041 --> 02:48:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And these tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3601
02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:40.240
<v Speaker 1>she's in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rains all the fucking time.</v>

3602
02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Think and maybe this is maybe not so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's raised card racecar driving </v>

3603
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:47.290
<v Speaker 1>more popular in Europe than it is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

3604
02:48:47.291 --> 02:48:48.150
<v Speaker 1>That I would say so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3605
02:48:48.170 --> 02:48:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Formula One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like dumb racing nascar.</v>

3606
02:48:53.290 --> 02:48:58.290
<v Speaker 1>He's got swag man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And swapping bank is why does he have a </v>

3607
02:48:58.401 --> 02:49:00.090
<v Speaker 1>southern accent is most of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will listen to.</v>

3608
02:49:00.290 --> 02:49:02.570
<v Speaker 1>What if I did it like a contradicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

3609
02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:05.110
<v Speaker 1>What if I would accidentally be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated?</v>

3610
02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the swabbing paint that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment</v>

3611
02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:10.560
<v Speaker 2>they're going left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Lin love with this.</v>

3612
02:49:10.561 --> 02:49:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Chevron is gaining ground on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>

3613
02:49:13.171 --> 02:49:18.171
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable the way he continues </v>

3614
02:49:18.171 --> 02:49:20.751
<v Speaker 2>to turn left baffles the mind of razor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing a reparable damage to his </v>

3615
02:49:20.761 --> 02:49:25.440
<v Speaker 2>reputation and to his chassis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can he do it with such accuracy?</v>

3616
02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:28.380
<v Speaker 2>The art form outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're fighting.</v>

3617
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:30.150
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird culture.</v>

3618
02:49:30.151 --> 02:49:31.380
<v Speaker 2>The English man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they they.</v>

3619
02:49:31.450 --> 02:49:34.110
<v Speaker 2>They're also the regal illness and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>their way.</v>

3620
02:49:34.111 --> 02:49:39.111
<v Speaker 2>They have like set up all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different sorts of patterns that they </v>

3621
02:49:39.111 --> 02:49:41.700
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the rest and behavior of control.</v>

3622
02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you play snooker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A madden play snooker of a hooligan will</v>

3623
02:49:48.331 --> 02:49:52.940
<v Speaker 2>be playing eight ball at the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a gentleman prefers Nuka.</v>

3624
02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Knowing your place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing your place,</v>

3625
02:49:55.470 --> 02:49:57.810
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Americans figured out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That white stripe that they're keeping </v>

3630
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.270
<v Speaker 2>the middle of their chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time ago.</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing and protocol.</v>

3637
02:50:22.771 --> 02:50:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Powdered wigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why did they have powdered wigs?</v>

3638
02:50:25.230 --> 02:50:28.860
<v Speaker 2>There was always a form of even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>French up until World War One war,</v>

3639
02:50:29.270 --> 02:50:32.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We have more money than you people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're.</v>

3646
02:50:42.681 --> 02:50:46.880
<v Speaker 2>We're a higher birth so our soldiers are</v>
<v Speaker 2>decorated with the honor that that is,</v>

3647
02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:48.630
<v Speaker 2>that is bestowed on the greatest army.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and bright colors.</v>

3651
02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Think about how birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing until Vietnam.</v>
