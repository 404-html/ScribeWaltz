00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Too Fun and we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.140
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Mr Brogan,</v>

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>have pleasure to have you here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Doing it on skype was fun and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:11.964
<v Speaker 1>And you are to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only podcast I've ever done on </v>

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>skype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.433
<v Speaker 1>But I just had to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like if you couldn't get down </v>

9
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a way.</v>

10
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was nice to be able to do it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

11
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.234
<v Speaker 1>but much nicer to see here in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's better to be here in person </v>

12
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.344
<v Speaker 1>and actually what responsible if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be being here in person is that I </v>

13
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:32.964
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't actually come all this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance even to be on your show unless </v>

14
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you paid me lots of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we did not prepare to do but,</v>

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.713
<v Speaker 1>but because I have this conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up at the end of the week called </v>

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Seapak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm surprised you didn't know that</v>

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>conference on precession and ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

18
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the end of this week for those </v>

19
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>living in southern California.</v>

20
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Might want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a look at the word sell it.</v>

23
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Tell everybody where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's that and what is it about?</v>

24
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>It's Rancho Mirage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great name and means there is</v>

25
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>no ranch but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron Tomo hires,</v>

26
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.523
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhere near palm springs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is about exactly what it says </v>

27
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.973
<v Speaker 1>conference on precession and ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and did it questions to begin </v>

28
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>with the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>so I say the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole scenario,</v>

30
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the standards scenario of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what causes procession,</v>

31
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>which is supposedly a kind of a wobble </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the earth caused by,</v>

32
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:32.004
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows exactly what and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter theory is that it isn't that </v>

33
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>it's that there is a dwarf star of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort orbiting the sun,</v>

34
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>upsetting the balance of the celestial </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical balance of it.</v>

35
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And that makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

36
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>well what's the difference one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another?</v>

37
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>There's procession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make a difference actually in</v>

38
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:57.021
<v Speaker 1>the big picture because it means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>our solar system basically conforms with</v>

39
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>all of the other solar systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which mostly are dual in nature.</v>

40
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>A serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

41
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>as the Dwarf Star that circled around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

42
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:06.614
<v Speaker 1>series b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's responsible for all sorts of </v>

43
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>measurable phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it starts off from there,</v>

44
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:13.764
<v Speaker 1>but then the ancient knowledge comes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>because precession and this is a big </v>

45
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:18.804
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precession seems to be a factor of </v>

46
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>virtually every ancient society be it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

47
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll let China and India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America,</v>

48
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Mesoamerica or so called primitive a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word I hate to use.</v>

49
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:35.784
<v Speaker 1>It simply means an intellectual lies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not expressed in coherent western </v>

50
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>philosophy for whatever that's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the um,</v>

51
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but er procession is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a known fact,</v>

52
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered actually long time ago you'd </v>

53
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:53.064
<v Speaker 1>think by now it would be common </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and everybody would teach it </v>

54
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a sort of a joke.</v>

55
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm interesting to people don't teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

56
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very bizarre</v>

57
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>thing that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so prominent in ancient cultures,</v>

58
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 2>in ancient society that they literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>map this out,</v>

59
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>this 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>year cycle.</v>

60
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>It's wobble of the earth</v>

61
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.910
<v Speaker 1>and that we rarely talk about it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

62
00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:14.744
<v Speaker 1>because it upsets the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a knowledge of this going back </v>

63
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:18.794
<v Speaker 1>to ancient times presupposes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very advanced observational </v>

64
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.913
<v Speaker 1>astronomy dating at a time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly people were still living in </v>

65
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is actually a big deal.</v>

66
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.333
<v Speaker 1>Hence the conference on precession and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient knowledge comes into it </v>

67
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.233
<v Speaker 1>because understanding that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly sophisticated scientific </v>

68
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.193
<v Speaker 1>understanding that goes back not just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Egypt itself but far thousands </v>

69
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:49.994
<v Speaker 1>and thousand millennia beyond upsets </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is effectively the reigning </v>

70
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.500
<v Speaker 1>religion of today except that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>call itself a religion.</v>

71
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It calls itself science which is based </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly on reason.</v>

72
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It's dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of those things are true.</v>

73
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not based on science and science is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not based upon reason.</v>

74
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll get it,</v>

75
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.533
<v Speaker 2>well some sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but archeology in particular is very </v>

76
00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:11.954
<v Speaker 2>rigid and its ideas and a lot of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the professors that have </v>

77
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>written books and that teach these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't want to let them go.</v>

78
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.530
<v Speaker 2>And when noon knowledge is discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>that challenges those ideas,</v>

79
00:04:21.531 --> 00:04:22.364
<v Speaker 2>they fight it rigorously even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge like the stuff that you </v>

80
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 2>exposed with doctor Ron Shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Schoch rather,</v>

81
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 2>which was the water erosion on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sphinx,</v>

82
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 2>which we were talking about before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast is,</v>

83
00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:37.940
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the best pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence because the last time there was</v>

84
00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:40.340
<v Speaker 2>rainfall heavy rainfall in the Nile </v>
<v Speaker 2>Valley was,</v>

85
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.510
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>9,000</v>

86
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 2>vcs that what it was.</v>

87
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>They debate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's anyway,</v>

88
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>it's way before the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynastic Egypt.</v>

89
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.360
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a question of how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how have,</v>

90
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.203
<v Speaker 1>how old are when those rains fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's big bit of that of thing </v>

91
00:04:56.171 --> 00:05:01.171
<v Speaker 1>here that I'm now at liberty to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to relate publicly.</v>

92
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't when I first got chocolate,</v>

93
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.274
<v Speaker 1>where do Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another two hour podcast in </v>

94
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:09.874
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of getting shock interested </v>

95
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.514
<v Speaker 1>in this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he finally agreed very </v>

96
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>hesitantly and very skeptically to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>along because he had to see the evidence</v>

97
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:19.924
<v Speaker 1>for my s for himself and I scraped </v>
<v Speaker 1>together a bit of money to bring them </v>

98
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>over and we got into the swings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closure.</v>

99
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was luke got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally.</v>

100
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I think we bribed our way and very early</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

101
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.963
<v Speaker 1>well and Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is possible and bribed our </v>

102
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>way in.</v>

103
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And he walked into the swinks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closure.</v>

104
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Actually when we get that up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

105
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the,</v>

106
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:41.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

107
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.673
<v Speaker 1>the level of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extent of the weathering of the </v>

108
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:46.264
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weathering and chalk looked at it and </v>

109
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.771
<v Speaker 1>everybody else walks into the sinks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>closure and has this actually this shock</v>

110
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.180
<v Speaker 1>of recognition of the presence of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous work of,</v>

111
00:05:57.181 --> 00:05:58.014
<v Speaker 1>of sacred art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpture in fact of sacred sculpture </v>

112
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>and chocolate with chocolate is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

113
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

114
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was to go way back to Tammy,</v>

115
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>right to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first slides and shock.</v>

116
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else sees the spanx as a work </v>
<v Speaker 1>of art.</v>

117
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.273
<v Speaker 1>Shock sees the rocks and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>geologist and he back like this and he </v>

118
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

119
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>these rocks look like they're hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of years old.</v>

120
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't quote me on that because that's of</v>

121
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:30.524
<v Speaker 1>course absolute heresy that the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular sculpture on earth should </v>

122
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:34.394
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

123
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of years actually,</v>

124
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>even th th th the 4,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that are,</v>

125
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.233
<v Speaker 1>that it's associated with do not conform</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anybody's idea of how civilization </v>

126
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes back to your,</v>

127
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>of why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academic,</v>

128
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:56.111
<v Speaker 1>I call it the academic establishment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so is so passionately,</v>

129
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defends the old paradigm the way that it</v>

130
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>does because of the reigning paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trainings religion today,</v>

131
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>which is not acknowledged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has religion,</v>

132
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.803
<v Speaker 1>is that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the Church of progress and its </v>

133
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>credo just like the virgin birth is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Credo of,</v>

134
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.180
<v Speaker 1>of early Christianity or a present day </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>

135
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Not that they know what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

136
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

137
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

138
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>the Credo of the Church of progress is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

139
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:29.654
<v Speaker 1>we are the most sophisticated human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings that have ever lived on the face </v>

140
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:33.794
<v Speaker 1>of the planet with our hydrogen bombs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our nerve gas in our stripe </v>

141
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>toothpaste and our Disneyland's were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best that ever was.</v>

142
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that progress as it's called,</v>

143
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 1>goes in a straight line from primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>caveman up to ourselves.</v>

144
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And when it becomes self evident that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

145
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:57.551
<v Speaker 1>very ancient times they had knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>precession,</v>

146
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:02.891
<v Speaker 1>which is an incredible thing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unimaginable that it happens</v>

147
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:08.951
<v Speaker 1>through careful observation because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun,</v>

148
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if all of the audience will</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what what this is.</v>

149
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's worth talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>

150
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.480
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the spring equinox now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the last,</v>

151
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.360
<v Speaker 1>the sun is rising against the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

152
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>the last bits of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

154
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Pisces.</v>

155
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:28.574
<v Speaker 1>It may even be in the earliest stages of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aquarius and the gradually the Sun </v>

156
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.873
<v Speaker 1>precesses that's to say it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards around the Zodiac in a cycle </v>

157
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>that takes 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>canonically 25,000,</v>

158
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:43.394
<v Speaker 1>920 years to make a complete circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this means is that it actually </v>

159
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:53.141
<v Speaker 1>takes 72 years precisely for the sun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>precess one degree.</v>

160
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.003
<v Speaker 1>So this is nothing who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there for 72 years watching the </v>

161
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:00.670
<v Speaker 1>track of the sun in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

162
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.603
<v Speaker 1>in a cycle that takes 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years to go around and observe that </v>

163
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a discrepancy and then pass that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information down.</v>

164
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.623
<v Speaker 1>And then why should they care somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another deeply connected with the </v>

165
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>civilization of that time and with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

166
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.423
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the numbers involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another hours of conversation </v>

167
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:27.170
<v Speaker 1>accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 72 in the 73 are significant numbers</v>

168
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>in practically all of the developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerologically based society.</v>

169
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So in Egypt set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the bad guy?</v>

170
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Derivative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably Satan is derived from set.</v>

171
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a great God.</v>

172
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>That is to say the gods are not gods in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any superstitious fashion.</v>

173
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>They represented the embodiments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic principles,</v>

174
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.213
<v Speaker 1>so excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set is he who fixes spirit and matter </v>

175
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.213
<v Speaker 1>and the whole basis of an esoteric of </v>
<v Speaker 1>any esoteric doctrine including most of </v>

176
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>the religions that are around even today</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're deprived forms.</v>

177
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.603
<v Speaker 1>The objective of any esoteric discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to free ourselves individually and </v>

178
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>collectively for imprisonment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

179
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.793
<v Speaker 1>This is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in mortality and so in some sense </v>

180
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.574
<v Speaker 1>or another that processional cycle is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very important than the numbers are </v>

181
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 1>important in the myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>

182
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.480
<v Speaker 1>we don't have time for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Ozar,</v>

183
00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>iris is the good king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

184
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 1>This is all very carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>expounded very brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

186
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.373
<v Speaker 1>in the hamlet myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become Shakespeare's hamlet and </v>

187
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>then in the lion king and Disney's lion </v>
<v Speaker 1>king and the movies especially,</v>

188
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.353
<v Speaker 1>which is really pretty brilliant anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set as the good king who is beloved by </v>

189
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:50.604
<v Speaker 1>his people and set his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wicked brother is evil brother who </v>

190
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>was determined to unseat him than steal </v>
<v Speaker 1>his sister wife Isis while he's at it.</v>

191
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.103
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets,</v>

192
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>sets a trap for Ozar Harris and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's set and it's 72 followers.</v>

193
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.493
<v Speaker 1>So 72 is this number associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the 72 to 73 is a very </v>

194
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:17.601
<v Speaker 1>significant ratio actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which pervades the philosophies of,</v>

195
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of the esoteric civilizations.</v>

196
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>So all of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of all of this,</v>

197
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:29.931
<v Speaker 1>instead of being the kind of ask a quack</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic,</v>

198
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>the same guy you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

199
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>it still thinks the six is weathered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>

200
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Ask One of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ancient myth is about and they say,</v>

201
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.693
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's just a fabrication written by </v>

202
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 1>primitive people who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain the mysteries of the universe.</v>

203
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.503
<v Speaker 1>It's the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The perimeter of people are the ones </v>

204
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:47.514
<v Speaker 1>with the phds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And back then they not only did they </v>

205
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>understand these scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these astronomical,</v>

206
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.133
<v Speaker 3>these astronomical facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they orchestrated their whole </v>

207
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 3>civilization around those facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the more,</v>

208
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 3>the deeper you get into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more miraculous,</v>

209
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

210
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 3>the extent of ancient knowledge becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

211
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 3>what is the mainstream explanation when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

212
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about the prevalence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the number 72 and their understanding of</v>

213
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 3>the procession of the equinoxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they address it at all?</v>

214
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.614
<v Speaker 3>Like how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they sort of explain how they </v>

215
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 3>knew about this 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year cycle?</v>

216
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I was at a very quick answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

217
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 3>For a change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

218
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.400
<v Speaker 3>they just explained it's just ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

219
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 3>it's sorta like the Parthenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Acropolis,</v>

220
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.853
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one is the Acropolis is the </v>

221
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 3>building and the Parthenon is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

222
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

223
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 3>No breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both their temples about the buildings,</v>

224
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.880
<v Speaker 3>but what does the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

225
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.713
<v Speaker 3>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

226
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.553
<v Speaker 3>the base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the base is the one that they don't </v>

227
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 3>explain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

228
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>They just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

229
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 3>we don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

230
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous base,</v>

231
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 3>the huge stones that the Acropolis is </v>
<v Speaker 3>built on.</v>

232
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because don't goes up.</v>

233
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Acropolis is the one on top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

234
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.283
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the Parthenon is what they're built </v>

235
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 3>on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the base structure where whatever it is,</v>

236
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:06.830
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

237
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.910
<v Speaker 3>the bottom area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

238
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.863
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never really looked that deeply </v>

239
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>

240
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:14.704
<v Speaker 3>there's a friend of mine who's worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the proportions and the </v>

241
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated proportions of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Parthenon,</v>

242
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:26.521
<v Speaker 3>and it shows actually that it's as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as my noodly orchestrated as anything in</v>

243
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's much better than Egypt,</v>

244
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 3>but much later than Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no one knows who built it and no one</v>

245
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:34.714
<v Speaker 3>knows why they built it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those weird ones where it's </v>

246
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 3>not really described and the tax and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acropolis is built upon it.</v>

247
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.591
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

248
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 3>some explained to me by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Greek historians,</v>

249
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:44.494
<v Speaker 3>by people understand Greek history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just really don't understand where </v>

250
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 3>it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

251
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.113
<v Speaker 3>I believe that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that I think it's pretty certain </v>

252
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 3>that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not of Egyptian age,</v>

253
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:55.144
<v Speaker 3>although if you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic paving stones at the bottom of </v>

254
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 3>it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

255
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 3>But whenever you see those gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stones,</v>

256
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty good indication of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier period of construction.</v>

257
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.223
<v Speaker 3>As at Baalbek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these monolithic 1200 ton </v>

258
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.060
<v Speaker 3>blocks that they think the Romans put </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

259
00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's in Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

260
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 3>That's Lebanon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

261
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:22.261
<v Speaker 3>So there's a ton of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this kind of indirect evidence.</v>

262
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 3>And when you put it all together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

263
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.930
<v Speaker 3>there's enough of a picture there so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it overthrows the basis.</v>

264
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.943
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's important about it is up one </v>

265
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:34.084
<v Speaker 3>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

266
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.193
<v Speaker 3>In another sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it overthrows the suppose scientific </v>

267
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 3>basis of the Church of progress that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the most sophisticated people that</v>

268
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:44.074
<v Speaker 3>have aware and we can do whatever we </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleased with this once glorious planet </v>

269
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 3>of ours without worrying about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're the best in everyone.</v>

270
00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Before us was primitive.</v>

271
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.833
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of new evidence now since </v>

272
00:14:54.521 --> 00:14:56.530
<v Speaker 4>you started your work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

273
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.393
<v Speaker 4>particularly all that nuclear glass that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're finding that corresponds with </v>

274
00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:01.504
<v Speaker 4>meteor impacts throughout Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Asia and that that's somewhere around </v>

275
00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:05.554
<v Speaker 4>the end of the ice age really in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same sort of a time period when they do </v>

276
00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:12.010
<v Speaker 4>core samples and they find this nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 4>glass,</v>

277
00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:14.890
<v Speaker 4>it's all at around 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus years ago.</v>

278
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.063
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff really starts to </v>

279
00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:18.874
<v Speaker 4>indicate that we're looking at possibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>an event that might've shaped human </v>

280
00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:26.490
<v Speaker 4>history or a reset of a large percentage</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

281
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.403
<v Speaker 4>of the people on this planet where </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization in many areas was all but </v>

282
00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:32.740
<v Speaker 4>wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they had to rebuild again.</v>

283
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

284
00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually this is coming to the fore now.</v>

285
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of evidence for these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the tektites their code,</v>

286
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock thinks that they are the result of</v>

287
00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:47.940
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic cme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coronal mass ejection,</v>

288
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.450
<v Speaker 1>giant solar flares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and does a lot of evidence with this.</v>

289
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:52.284
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know if we get into talking about it </v>

290
00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:54.594
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will at sea pack for short of shock </v>

291
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:58.320
<v Speaker 1>will be its effect anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

292
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

293
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.783
<v Speaker 1>it's unlikely that it's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear blast because it would be </v>

294
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.220
<v Speaker 1>inconceivable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

295
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.150
<v Speaker 1>at least by our standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manmade nuclear blast.</v>

296
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Although when you go into the Hindu </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts,</v>

297
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's the upanishads where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they describe what sounds like,</v>

298
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's described as a battle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gods,</v>

299
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.890
<v Speaker 1>but for all the world it does sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

300
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:26.933
<v Speaker 1>like a nuclear conflagration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a human made nuclear </v>

301
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:31.860
<v Speaker 1>conflagration.</v>

302
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.993
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody knows enough to </v>

303
00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:38.130
<v Speaker 1>say what it is other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story is in there.</v>

304
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.080
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

305
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a writer by trade,</v>

306
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in the way that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>language is used.</v>

307
00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 1>And so myth is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the principle of misleading words</v>

308
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.110
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

309
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.650
<v Speaker 1>if you look in the dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first stick,</v>

310
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.070
<v Speaker 1>the first meaning that it gives for myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lie.</v>

311
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about the myth because </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythbusters goes to them.</v>

312
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.343
<v Speaker 1>That myth is ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ancients didn't see myth is a </v>

313
00:17:09.971 --> 00:17:10.804
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What myth actually is when you get into </v>

314
00:17:12.661 --> 00:17:17.661
<v Speaker 1>it fairly deeply is it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the interplay of cosmic principles</v>

315
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.360
<v Speaker 1>described as drama rather than in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>

316
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.553
<v Speaker 1>So once you get a good look at this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary but opaque book called </v>

317
00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:30.354
<v Speaker 1>hamlet's mill by George Joe Desante,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yana and heritage on deck and two tour </v>

318
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.943
<v Speaker 1>historians of science at Mit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about as respectable as </v>

319
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:40.380
<v Speaker 1>credentials can be.</v>

320
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.693
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as myth is understood as having </v>

321
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.483
<v Speaker 1>both a rigorous scientific as well as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as philosophical and spiritual </v>

322
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 1>base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

323
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>the whole understanding of myth turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

324
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

325
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 1>in hamlet and Shakespeare's hamlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is based upon the Danish,</v>

326
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it was based upon a Danish folk tale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

327
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 1>which then becomes quite brilliantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the lion king.</v>

328
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Disney film.</v>

329
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 1>You see how the myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

330
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:20.500
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can decode the ohs,</v>

331
00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Iris Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace Smith as,</v>

332
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.003
<v Speaker 1>as pure as pure science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might call us a spiritual or </v>

333
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:31.993
<v Speaker 1>sacred science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time that the ripping </v>

334
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 1>good story when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you put it that way,</v>

335
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.143
<v Speaker 1>a story because then everybody can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it even if they don't </v>

336
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:41.454
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they can't articulate what </v>

337
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:49.650
<v Speaker 1>they've understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of the story soaks through.</v>

338
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So myth is actually the more you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

339
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.790
<v Speaker 1>my case is not that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's better than nothing.</v>

340
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you know about it,</v>

341
00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.813
<v Speaker 1>the more amazing mythology becomes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have been able to put </v>

342
00:19:02.521 --> 00:19:07.521
<v Speaker 1>together these complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high hierarchical,</v>

343
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.710
<v Speaker 1>esoteric concepts in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>resonates as a story otherwise,</v>

344
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.300
<v Speaker 1>in so far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

345
00:19:17.301 --> 00:19:18.134
<v Speaker 1>our own cosmology is next to impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand unless you are a </v>

346
00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:26.621
<v Speaker 1>cosmologist and schooled in the abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics that make the thing work.</v>

347
00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

348
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean the mathematics is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond me,</v>

349
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.323
<v Speaker 1>but some of my astrophysicist trends can</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it to me in such a way that I </v>

350
00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:36.704
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still doesn't have any emotional </v>

351
00:19:38.781 --> 00:19:39.390
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>

352
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.223
<v Speaker 4>So essentially what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they didn't have the sort of </v>

353
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 4>scientific discipline that we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

354
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 4>They didn't understand a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that we know today as far as a,</v>

355
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 4>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

356
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.013
<v Speaker 4>academics or scientists relay </v>
<v Speaker 4>information about space or about </v>

357
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:56.184
<v Speaker 4>cosmology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they did is they combined </v>

358
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 4>theater and story with the actual facts </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they knew.</v>

359
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 4>So that was the way they would relay </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

360
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:06.234
<v Speaker 4>And that's the way that stuff would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed on that information to be passed </v>

361
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:09.114
<v Speaker 4>on through these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in those stories was an actual </v>

362
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:15.160
<v Speaker 4>history of the world itself as far as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew.</v>

363
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Right</v>

364
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.171
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

365
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that and through symbolism.</v>

366
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.123
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an infinitely superior way of </v>

367
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 1>communicating knowledge because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be an expert.</v>

368
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.533
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it soaks into your bones in such a way </v>

369
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>

370
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.680
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

371
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 1>it direct personally and collectively </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's behaviors.</v>

372
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.133
<v Speaker 1>And it's my firm conviction that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Egypt lasted as a coherent </v>

373
00:20:43.871 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in its dynastic form,</v>

374
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 1>but 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years</v>

375
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.310
<v Speaker 3>and our lunatic societies coming apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the seams in front of our eyes at 300</v>

376
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:55.800
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to talk to you about the,</v>

377
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.673
<v Speaker 3>the written history of Egypt and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hieroglyphic history of the pharaohs </v>

378
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.591
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

379
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:03.391
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

380
00:21:03.391 --> 00:21:04.224
<v Speaker 3>I think it was from magical Egypt one </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were talking about the </v>

381
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.773
<v Speaker 3>historical record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they have written down in the </v>

382
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:11.044
<v Speaker 3>hieroglyphs about the pharaohs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it goes back far beyond what we </v>

383
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:16.850
<v Speaker 3>think of as the birth of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

384
00:21:16.851 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

385
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 3>the construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

386
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.294
<v Speaker 3>the great pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe they put it modern academics </v>

387
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:22.780
<v Speaker 3>put it at 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>

388
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:23.614
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

389
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.543
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe that it's possible that </v>

390
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Egypt existed as far back as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you said 34,000</v>

391
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:31.661
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

392
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their own,</v>

393
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 3>that's the Egyptians account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not mine,</v>

394
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Course.</v>

395
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.430
<v Speaker 3>As expressed as expressed in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

396
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.833
<v Speaker 3>in a couple of an in a stone tablet </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the Palermo stone because it's </v>

397
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 3>now in Palermo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Italy.</v>

398
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:47.643
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in a very fragmentary papyruses </v>

399
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.720
<v Speaker 3>called the Turin papyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is now in Turin.</v>

400
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.693
<v Speaker 3>And both of these documents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is a stone stele and the other is a </v>

401
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 3>hippopotamus tell or recount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

402
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.133
<v Speaker 3>long periods when Egypt was ruled first </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the net chodo which means the gods </v>

403
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I take to mean fully,</v>

404
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 3>fully realized divine human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

405
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 3>human beings that have attained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have passed the,</v>

406
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 3>the test of the quest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four in mortality who are in effect,</v>

407
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 3>they've outsmarted death or they've out </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed debt.</v>

408
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 3>You why do you believe this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

409
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 3>because their work speak for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>as it were.</v>

410
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

411
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the level of the,</v>

412
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.230
<v Speaker 3>now we talked going back even to an even</v>
<v Speaker 3>to um,</v>

413
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.113
<v Speaker 3>to dynastic Egypt because the temples </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and the level of art </v>

414
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.473
<v Speaker 3>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the sculpture is such </v>

415
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 3>that standard.</v>

416
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.353
<v Speaker 3>I say stay genius is rare enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but standard human genius doesn't seem </v>

417
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 3>to apply to these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructions.</v>

418
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:12.451
<v Speaker 3>And the core academics simply dismiss it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of hand is really very talented.</v>

419
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exponent of a barbaric and um,</v>

420
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.620
<v Speaker 3>and primitive understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmos.</v>

421
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:24.040
<v Speaker 3>I leading my trips there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I do as you know,</v>

422
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 3>a few times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next one coming up.</v>

423
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody listening in,</v>

424
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.980
<v Speaker 3>how could people go in on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>trips with you?</v>

425
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.881
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy.</v>

426
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:31.930
<v Speaker 3>You pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

427
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.520
<v Speaker 3>Where do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do they find you though?</v>

428
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.510
<v Speaker 3>On my website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>John Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>west.com.</v>

430
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the website or,</v>

431
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>or my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my email.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

433
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 3>you messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give your email.</v>

434
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

435
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.013
<v Speaker 3>My people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible people are going to send you </v>

436
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 3>naked pictures for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

437
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 3>not of themselves.</v>

438
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.910
<v Speaker 3>I am I familiar with the term Dick pic </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's,</v>

439
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

440
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your,</v>

441
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.830
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts are that these people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>live 34,000</v>

442
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:11.831
<v Speaker 3>years ago were incredibly advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much further advanced than we are today,</v>

443
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't take much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you understand what's involved,</v>

444
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:16.790
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying,</v>

445
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:17.624
<v Speaker 3>but I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty damn advanced compared to </v>

446
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:22.510
<v Speaker 3>the people a few hundred years ago or in</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain ways we are abreast.</v>

447
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 3>We still can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't,</v>

448
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.450
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't and wouldn't build the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedral of shots.</v>

449
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>

450
00:24:29.421 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the best of my knowledge,</v>

451
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.893
<v Speaker 3>who could produce a building that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>based upon sacred principles that even </v>

452
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:41.840
<v Speaker 3>comes close to sacred geometry and set </v>
<v Speaker 3>grieve.</v>

453
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:42.763
<v Speaker 3>Even that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a few people really know quite a </v>

454
00:24:44.391 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 3>bit about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't design Jada and that's</v>

455
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:52.750
<v Speaker 3>well that's 12th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it about Egypt and that time in</v>

456
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:54.314
<v Speaker 3>particular that in your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously there's a lot of </v>

457
00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 3>speculation going on here because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so little evidence from 34,000</v>

458
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:01.334
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is it about that area that you </v>

459
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 3>think develop people at such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly high level?</v>

460
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Cause unless there's more evidence to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>found there,</v>

461
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:11.630
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to be any parallels </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere else in the world.</v>

462
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Like that one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually there's,</v>

463
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.893
<v Speaker 3>there's a fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fairly simple explanation for </v>

464
00:25:18.681 --> 00:25:20.550
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a change it,</v>

465
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Speaker 3>most of this stuff is so complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to go back a bit to the,</v>

466
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:24.963
<v Speaker 3>the rule by the net shit who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gods themselves and the names of </v>

467
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 3>those real is a given and the length of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that they reigned.</v>

468
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the lines,</v>

469
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.960
<v Speaker 3>the line of time is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

470
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Well this is where we're getting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>34,000,</v>

471
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.710
<v Speaker 3>36,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC from.</v>

472
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you add the,</v>

473
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.003
<v Speaker 3>the time's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Turin for pirates has a similar </v>

474
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:49.390
<v Speaker 3>thing of the net that reign rule of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>net shadow and the rule by the,</v>

475
00:25:49.391 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 3>it's called the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>the followers of the,</v>

476
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 3>the followers of the companions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>horace.</v>

477
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.753
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the names are given and the regularly </v>

478
00:25:57.101 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you add those all up together,</v>

479
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.220
<v Speaker 3>you get around 34 36,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>

480
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 3>four does this some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

481
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:06.260
<v Speaker 3>but Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the pharaohs,</v>

482
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Speaker 3>didn't they live hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence for that.</v>

483
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 3>But wasn't it written that they did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

484
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure what those dates are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

485
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I've not actually deeply researched </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

486
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I get those figures from [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UBX,</v>

487
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.723
<v Speaker 3>the great genius with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpronounceable name who put together </v>

488
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:30.881
<v Speaker 3>the whole interpretation of symbolist </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egypt from which my work is derived.</v>

489
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I regard myself as Schweller's Boswell,</v>

490
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.353
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making his basically impenetrable work </v>

491
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 3>of accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accessible to dummies like me.</v>

492
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.710
<v Speaker 1>No smart guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart guys like you and not dumb.</v>

493
00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 1>He's like politicians and quack </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics.</v>

494
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're talking about 34,000</v>

495
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:55.290
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the average person today lives to</v>

496
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:56.124
<v Speaker 1>be about 80 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about an incredible </v>

497
00:26:57.541 --> 00:26:59.330
<v Speaker 1>number of pharaoh's then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all that is depicted apparently,</v>

499
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 1>apparently the names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the names are given that I get that from</v>

500
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:11.691
<v Speaker 1>Schwaller from the one from the one long</v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter he wrote called the,</v>

501
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.411
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

502
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the chronology choreography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls it [inaudible] not the word for</v>

503
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:18.714
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the chronology of Egypt where he's </v>

504
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.360
<v Speaker 1>looking to back up to 200 from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholarly point of view,</v>

505
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:27.894
<v Speaker 1>for the mode of the scholarly argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Egyptians knew what they were </v>

506
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 1>talking about when they were assigning </v>
<v Speaker 1>these long reins.</v>

507
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That these are not fictitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

508
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.193
<v Speaker 1>this is not made up history that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to you fool the people who </v>

509
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:43.970
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read the hieroglyphs anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only describes,</v>

510
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.180
<v Speaker 1>could read the hieroglyphs.</v>

511
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So the trawler wrote this very long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful and scholarly,</v>

512
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

513
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.071
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

514
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 1>not lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that chapter.</v>

515
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.913
<v Speaker 1>And then at the very end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this throwaway line and does of course </v>

516
00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the Great Sphinx of Giza has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>weathered,</v>

517
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.300
<v Speaker 1>chose unmistakable signs of aquatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>erosion.</v>

518
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And that was my little epiphany because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked up on that and said,</v>

519
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of this isn't science,</v>

520
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's geology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the geologists can be,</v>

521
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can will agree that this is,</v>

522
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 1>this cannot have taken place since 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

523
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 1>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>bc when the synxis supposedly built this</v>

524
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 1>will upset the whole paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of civilization will have to be,</v>

525
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 1>our view of civilization will have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>rethought.</v>

526
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a long,</v>

527
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.853
<v Speaker 1>long now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four decade long quest to find somebody </v>

528
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>to back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're now,</v>

529
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:45.050
<v Speaker 1>my sense of it is closing in on beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the opposition.</v>

530
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And this'll be another thing I took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

531
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably be talking about at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seapak,</v>

532
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.613
<v Speaker 1>but probably have with how so I said a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more politely than I feel it </v>

533
00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:02.601
<v Speaker 1>necessary to talk about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with you and that is riffing on</v>

534
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.073
<v Speaker 1>a line that probably everybody who tunes</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this is pro is familiar with </v>

535
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 1>victor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who goes to the French poet,</v>

536
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 1>novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dramatist of the 19th century France.</v>

537
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Actually Frances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most most popular poet of the,</v>

538
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:22.044
<v Speaker 1>of the 19th century was v Victor Hugo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was Victor Hugo who wrote the </v>

539
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:27.114
<v Speaker 1>famous line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one thing stronger than all the </v>

540
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:32.550
<v Speaker 1>armies in the world and that is an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose time has come.</v>

541
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.900
<v Speaker 1>You know that line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

542
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what victor who go didn't think of,</v>

543
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.083
<v Speaker 1>or if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't express it was that the </v>

544
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 1>strongest thing in the world is an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose time has not yet gone.</v>

545
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And since it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a matter of record that all of the</v>

546
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 1>armies in the world be they military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>

547
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 1>financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>

548
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>agricultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even wherever there's a paradigm,</v>

549
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 1>there's an army devoted to protecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that paradigm.</v>

550
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And this is where we stand now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

551
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:11.610
<v Speaker 1>that the idea whose time has come only </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes when the second strongest,</v>

552
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.283
<v Speaker 1>the armies of the second strongest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world are beaten down and beaten </v>

553
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:19.054
<v Speaker 1>into the ground and somebody breaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Portcullis to the ivory tower where </v>

554
00:30:22.801 --> 00:30:23.634
<v Speaker 1>all of these guys live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a particular interest to me </v>

555
00:30:25.661 --> 00:30:30.190
<v Speaker 1>because I am a scholar by default,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a satirist by nature.</v>

556
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.623
<v Speaker 1>And really my whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole adult life has been devoted to </v>

557
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 1>proving a vision that I had at the age </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 13 or so.</v>

558
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.590
<v Speaker 1>But I was born into a lunatic asylum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the age of about 19,</v>

559
00:30:49.591 --> 00:30:50.424
<v Speaker 1>it was a very uncomfortable place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live where everybody's called the </v>

560
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.343
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

561
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that age,</v>

562
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 1>about 19 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew what I wanted to do,</v>

563
00:30:58.691 --> 00:30:59.524
<v Speaker 1>which was to be the little boy who said </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor has no clothes and to prove </v>

564
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.413
<v Speaker 1>to everybody's satisfaction that indeed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor has no clothes and it's a </v>

565
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:09.724
<v Speaker 1>lunatic asylum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end result took me a few couple of </v>

566
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.150
<v Speaker 1>decades to realize that it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

567
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.120
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life what happens is that no,</v>

568
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the people all older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will look,</v>

569
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the emperor has no clothes and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives happily ever after.</v>

570
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the disgraced </v>
<v Speaker 1>amparo gets up and goes back to his,</v>

571
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.870
<v Speaker 1>goes back to his palace and regroups the</v>
<v Speaker 1>empire.</v>

572
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.360
<v Speaker 1>And at the end they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the,</v>

573
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.223
<v Speaker 1>all of the forces of empire conspire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove to everyone that the emperor's </v>

574
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 1>clothes are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the child who's imaginary.</v>

575
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.253
<v Speaker 2>Talking about this before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a really fascinating aspect </v>

576
00:31:47.101 --> 00:31:49.660
<v Speaker 2>of this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was yours,</v>

577
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.843
<v Speaker 2>when I first became aware of your work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that Charlton Heston narrated </v>

578
00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:56.670
<v Speaker 2>documentary about the aging of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sphinx,</v>

579
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.160
<v Speaker 2>the mystery of the Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I believe is on NBC.</v>

580
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

581
00:32:00.801 --> 00:32:01.634
<v Speaker 2>what I thought was shocking was when Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shock was speaking to that Egypt </v>

582
00:32:09.361 --> 00:32:14.361
<v Speaker 2>tologist who was saying what evidence is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there of a culture that existed 7,000</v>

583
00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 2>years before ancient Egypt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

584
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.340
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like theories.</v>

585
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.203
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was laughing and the way he was </v>

586
00:32:22.411 --> 00:32:24.780
<v Speaker 2>doing it was so much ego involved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he was saying,</v>

587
00:32:24.781 --> 00:32:25.614
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

588
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.200
<v Speaker 2>this is not how I would picture an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>

589
00:32:28.201 --> 00:32:30.810
<v Speaker 2>Tologist laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that got me curious.</v>

590
00:32:30.811 --> 00:32:32.910
<v Speaker 2>I started getting into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would anybody think like that?</v>

591
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:34.080
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

592
00:32:34.081 --> 00:32:38.910
<v Speaker 2>these guys write books and they teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures and they teach classes based on</v>

593
00:32:38.911 --> 00:32:39.744
<v Speaker 2>this that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're teaching and now this </v>

594
00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:44.030
<v Speaker 2>information has been shown to be not </v>
<v Speaker 2>true anymore.</v>

595
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.600
<v Speaker 2>When doctor shock was showing this water</v>
<v Speaker 2>erosion,</v>

596
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:47.463
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that this was all before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the discovery of gold Beckley tappy and </v>

597
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:51.674
<v Speaker 2>once they discovered go Beckley Tapi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they know that there was a </v>

598
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated structure capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive stones circles.</v>

599
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:58.543
<v Speaker 2>That was 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago at least when it was </v>

600
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.993
<v Speaker 2>intentionally buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it could have easily been several </v>

601
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.440
<v Speaker 2>thousand years old then we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we know at least 12,000</v>

602
00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:10.274
<v Speaker 2>years ago someone was capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible design and incredible stone </v>

603
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:14.774
<v Speaker 2>structures with three dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals carved into the stone </v>

604
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very sophisticated now.</v>

605
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Has that guy been talked to since then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And has he amended his position on it?</v>

606
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.880
<v Speaker 1>As far as I know he hasn't and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>laner reasonably well.</v>

607
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.530
<v Speaker 1>We're civil to each other and it won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be long.</v>

608
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

609
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.840
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the generals of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

610
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:40.440
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

611
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.011
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

612
00:33:41.011 --> 00:33:41.844
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the army of the idea whose time has </v>

613
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>not yet gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

614
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.570
<v Speaker 1>his time is coming up pretty good.</v>

615
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Does he dress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back,</v>

616
00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.094
<v Speaker 2>Lee tappy now me cause his whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole position was there was no </v>

617
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What evidence is there?</v>

618
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Well now that you have this evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he say?</v>

619
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I haven't actually spoken to him and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if anyone has,</v>

620
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I see him in Egypt every once in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

621
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.593
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anyone has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said I ran into him fairly </v>

622
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just said hello.</v>

623
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:16.120
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think I'd really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd necessarily want to bring it up with</v>

624
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

625
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 1>off the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have him that the camera's on</v>

626
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:28.220
<v Speaker 1>us and just see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise,</v>

627
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.580
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise he's a dead duck.</v>

628
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.903
<v Speaker 2>But it's just so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems to be just clinging to this </v>

629
00:34:34.831 --> 00:34:35.664
<v Speaker 2>idea because he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in mainstream academia hasn't </v>

630
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.330
<v Speaker 2>accepted this predating of the Sphinx </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

631
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.210
<v Speaker 2>or also the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference in the structures,</v>

632
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.700
<v Speaker 2>like the difference in the construction </v>
<v Speaker 2>methods that were used.</v>

633
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.683
<v Speaker 2>One of the more fascinating things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of highlighted in your ancient </v>

634
00:34:50.911 --> 00:34:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a series magical Egypt,</v>

635
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:53.514
<v Speaker 2>which is fantastic and I highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommend it to anybody who is even </v>

636
00:34:56.881 --> 00:34:57.714
<v Speaker 2>remotely curious to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will be sucked in in an incredible </v>

637
00:34:59.761 --> 00:35:00.594
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got to the point where my wife was </v>

638
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.270
<v Speaker 2>walking by the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

639
00:35:03.271 --> 00:35:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're watching Egypt again.</v>

640
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.961
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

641
00:35:05.961 --> 00:35:08.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like six disks that goes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

642
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

643
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:10.974
<v Speaker 2>so the different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a clear distinction between the </v>

644
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.950
<v Speaker 2>older methods of construction and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>newer methods.</v>

645
00:35:16.951 --> 00:35:17.784
<v Speaker 2>They use different methods and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really obvious to someone like me who's </v>

646
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.960
<v Speaker 2>not even a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about it,</v>

647
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.033
<v Speaker 2>but you could see the difference and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also that these older structures were </v>

648
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.210
<v Speaker 2>below the newer structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you had a dig down to get them.</v>

649
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

650
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:33.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like the fact that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>address that.</v>

651
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.953
<v Speaker 2>The fact that this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like they want to lump this all </v>

652
00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:37.970
<v Speaker 2>into the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of crazy.</v>

653
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.730
<v Speaker 1>It is and but as long as they can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it,</v>

654
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 1>they will continue to get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

655
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.263
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second strongest thing in the world </v>

656
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 1>is the idea whose time has not yet gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anybody who doesn't,</v>

657
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say among myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between myself and my colleagues are all</v>

658
00:35:57.001 --> 00:35:59.450
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the,</v>

659
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question to prove,</v>

660
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 1>to demonstrate that the advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization existed in the very distant</v>

661
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:11.640
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in my case other cases,</v>

662
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:12.474
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in mine it's because that opens the </v>

663
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:17.300
<v Speaker 1>door in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't the pro,</v>

664
00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.213
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't affect the price of eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on a much more profound </v>

665
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:21.684
<v Speaker 1>philosophical level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it's understood that that </v>

666
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.930
<v Speaker 1>understanding that civilization goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back way much,</v>

667
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:32.931
<v Speaker 1>much further leads to the understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the acceptance that our role,</v>

668
00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 1>our destiny as human beings is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve in mortality.</v>

669
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.130
<v Speaker 1>This is as simple as all as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's just a head trip.</v>

670
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.353
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not understood that we have a </v>

671
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:49.350
<v Speaker 1>role to play in this grand cosmic state </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme,</v>

672
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 1>there's no civilization.</v>

673
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our,</v>

674
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.400
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our goal is to achieve in mortality.</v>

675
00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:58.870
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean as individuals or do you </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean like and what's in what way?</v>

676
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.293
<v Speaker 1>That we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we arrive at a level of consciousness </v>

677
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.720
<v Speaker 1>that is not subject to the death of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical body,</v>

678
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 1>so all of religion is based upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the,</v>

679
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.813
<v Speaker 1>the stories of the saints and the Rachis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the masters and so on is based upon </v>

680
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:16.763
<v Speaker 1>all of it is based upon their </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that have led them to this </v>

681
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.220
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's just a head trip,</v>

682
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 1>it's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be part of your very being.</v>

683
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.863
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of sacred art is to end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred music when it works is to </v>

684
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.360
<v Speaker 1>communicate even if only momentarily and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmentary.</v>

685
00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Really this understanding that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

686
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And speaking from my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

687
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I've never gone through a full blown </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystical experience,</v>

688
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 1>but I've had lots of these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in Egypt and the long study</v>

689
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:54.563
<v Speaker 1>and these moments in Egypt where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sudden realization that the world </v>

690
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:04.500
<v Speaker 1>as it as it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it manifests to our,</v>

691
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.323
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

692
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:07.883
<v Speaker 1>our faculties are normal faculties is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the only world there is this </v>

693
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:13.824
<v Speaker 1>something else beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was understood a lot better in </v>

694
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:21.080
<v Speaker 1>those days than now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually when we end up,</v>

695
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to mention this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you know this.</v>

696
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I've been spent the last couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sidetracked from my regular work</v>

697
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.440
<v Speaker 1>working on a book written by a friend of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

698
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

699
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.503
<v Speaker 3>who was not a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I helped him with the editing and </v>

700
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 3>contributed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is maybe the definitive book on</v>

701
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:45.390
<v Speaker 3>envy and the ease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what those are,</v>

702
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 3>right near death experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death experiences.</v>

703
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.543
<v Speaker 3>He was a Christian pastor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rare guy who actually lived what he </v>

704
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:51.514
<v Speaker 3>preached named David Solomon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had collected all of this </v>

705
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:56.014
<v Speaker 3>material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge amount of material that he was </v>

706
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 3>trying to systematize because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

707
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly not a common experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are 5,000</v>

708
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.993
<v Speaker 3>verifiable accounts of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been clinically dead and who have been </v>

709
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:11.914
<v Speaker 3>revived usually but through modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>methods because now one of the reasons </v>

710
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:20.461
<v Speaker 3>why it's now so common and before it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>reserved for the saints,</v>

711
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>the Great Saints and the mystics that </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern medicine has,</v>

712
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:24.784
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has improved to such an extent that if </v>

713
00:39:26.321 --> 00:39:27.154
<v Speaker 3>you get to these people quickly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any number of people who are clinically </v>

714
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 3>dead for x number of minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

715
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>not two days minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes more extended period than that</v>

716
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.760
<v Speaker 3>come back with these tales of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm.</v>

717
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Beyond that of the senses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a realm of higher consciousness.</v>

718
00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:52.951
<v Speaker 3>Basically what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they've experienced is his grace.</v>

719
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.420
<v Speaker 3>In Christian terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's grace,</v>

720
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a moment.</v>

721
00:39:56.501 --> 00:40:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Then they come back transformed and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back convinced that everything that</v>

722
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 3>they were doing before is either </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense or unimportant.</v>

723
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:05.734
<v Speaker 3>Then they often come back with a mission</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they don't have the </v>

724
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.170
<v Speaker 3>schooling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

725
00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand philosophically or</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritually what they've experienced.</v>

726
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:13.714
<v Speaker 3>They know what they've experienced and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they laugh at the debunkers who are </v>

727
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:20.230
<v Speaker 3>saying it's all brown hallucination of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain dying brain.</v>

728
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 3>This is all garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they've experienced,</v>

729
00:40:22.901 --> 00:40:23.734
<v Speaker 3>they've experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and David put these together in a </v>

730
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 3>systematic fashion and then as he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a Diclectin,</v>

731
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:30.094
<v Speaker 3>all this material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was telling him this is that he's </v>

732
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:34.054
<v Speaker 3>a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He financed our trip to go the tap pay </v>

733
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.843
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six years ago and he started losing his </v>

734
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 3>balance and he was a touchy guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows a lot about balance.</v>

735
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Also a bonsai master and the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pastor,</v>

736
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.610
<v Speaker 3>unusual guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he started losing his balance and it</v>

737
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:53.430
<v Speaker 3>wasn't going away and the doctors </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally figured out what he had,</v>

738
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.110
<v Speaker 3>what it was wrong with them and he had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glioma,</v>

739
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Glioblastoma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

740
00:40:58.091 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I forget purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something.</v>

741
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what a Glioma is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's a form of brain cancer that</v>

742
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 3>is 100% fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the only thing you have is that you</v>

743
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:08.044
<v Speaker 3>can't determine the timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they gave him something like 10 </v>

744
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:15.310
<v Speaker 3>months to 12 months to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually lived three years.</v>

745
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 3>And at that point he had all of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

746
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 3>And I told him when he was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

747
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:20.501
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey dude,</v>

748
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I should write a book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really good stuff.</v>

749
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 3>The way you're doing it is not like </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else has ever done.</v>

750
00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

751
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:28.380
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a writer.</v>

752
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.223
<v Speaker 3>I'm just doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when he found out the </v>

753
00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:32.440
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he had a mission,</v>

754
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 3>which was to get the book out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

755
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.170
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he drafted me into,</v>

756
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.123
<v Speaker 1>they'll put the words in ride harder and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lasted just long enough to get the </v>

757
00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>book finished and get it published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

758
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

759
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.320
<v Speaker 1>if this went viral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could make a difference.</v>

760
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very good at titled David.</v>

761
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

762
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it's called the dead saints chronicles </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtitle,</v>

763
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

764
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.040
<v Speaker 1>a zen journey through the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterlife.</v>

765
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is an absolutely extraordinary</v>

766
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:06.644
<v Speaker 1>book and it becomes quite clear when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go through this that what people have </v>

767
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 1>experienced is a state of grace that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not all the same.</v>

768
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people it's more profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people less so,</v>

769
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.953
<v Speaker 1>but all of these people are unprepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what they've experienced and all of </v>

770
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 1>them come back transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the cracker dynamics.</v>

771
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.530
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the ways they protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

772
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Peer Review was one way and the other is</v>
<v Speaker 1>their insistence.</v>

773
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell made?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gave them the right to make the rules</v>

774
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:38.510
<v Speaker 1>from science that applied to science </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the scientist that that makes,</v>

775
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 1>gives them the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big the rules,</v>

776
00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 1>know the rules of the rules and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their insists,</v>

777
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.253
<v Speaker 1>one of the chief element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the chief ways in which they </v>

778
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:52.901
<v Speaker 1>protect themselves is to insist that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal evidence,</v>

779
00:42:53.481 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 1>personal experience doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about you,</v>

780
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.450
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't buy a cookbook by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's never fried an egg.</v>

781
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.710
<v Speaker 1>So these are guys who've never fried a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual egg and these 5,000</v>

782
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:04.544
<v Speaker 1>accounts or people who've actually been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to this superior realm and come </v>

783
00:43:10.191 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 1>back to talk about it.</v>

784
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:12.563
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say you haven't had a mystical </v>

785
00:43:14.311 --> 00:43:16.140
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean a psychedelic experience?</v>

786
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.310
<v Speaker 4>Know that I've had yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've had psychedelic trance,</v>

787
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 4>which kind of psychedelic experiences </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've done,</v>

789
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you name it.</v>

790
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then,</v>

791
00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.560
<v Speaker 4>so you've done dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

792
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.320

793
00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.260
<v Speaker 1>not Mescalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

795
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 1>All of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

796
00:43:35.931 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The experience has come actually for me,</v>

797
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.850
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not a major,</v>

798
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not the state of grace that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

799
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.630
<v Speaker 4>you didn't experience a state of grace </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you did DMT.</v>

800
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Not Quite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

801
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.060
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not compared to what the,</v>

802
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:50.851
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

<v Speaker 4>One.</v>

805
00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:54.841
<v Speaker 4>One time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

806
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Did you do a lot of it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

807
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.200
<v Speaker 4>He gotta do a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

808
00:43:58.201 --> 00:44:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I made you just dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you go to this crazy geometric,</v>

809
00:44:01.831 --> 00:44:04.030
<v Speaker 4>infinite universe where you're coming?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

810
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.310
<v Speaker 4>he didn't get in there then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get,</v>

811
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I didn't need how long you in town for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pardon?</v>

812
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.263
<v Speaker 4>How long you in town for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Till tomorrow we're going to have to </v>

813
00:44:11.761 --> 00:44:13.620
<v Speaker 4>make something happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got up,</v>

814
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:14.543
<v Speaker 4>you got to go deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That experience that people are having </v>

815
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 4>and near death experience is mirrored by</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same extent.</v>

816
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.323
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you're aware of Doctor Rick </v>

817
00:44:22.051 --> 00:44:22.950
<v Speaker 4>strassman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

818
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:23.784
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

819
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:24.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

820
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.980
<v Speaker 4>I believe actually we met them when </v>
<v Speaker 4>chance was doing the brilliant guy.</v>

821
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 4>It's so important because what has </v>
<v Speaker 4>created</v>

822
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.870
<v Speaker 2>by his book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dmt,</v>

823
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:34.704
<v Speaker 2>the spirit molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did these clinical tests giving </v>

824
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 2>people dmt in a clinical setting and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the University of New Mexico.</v>

825
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:42.923
<v Speaker 2>And what they found was these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve this incredible state of </v>

826
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:49.420
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

827
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.200
<v Speaker 2>a more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vision of the future.</v>

828
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 2>They're more confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

829
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.273
<v Speaker 2>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is also mirrored by some of </v>

830
00:44:56.221 --> 00:44:57.054
<v Speaker 2>the John Hopkins tested they've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people with silicide been where </v>

831
00:44:59.581 --> 00:45:01.170
<v Speaker 2>people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

832
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have just a much better outlook </v>

833
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.093
<v Speaker 2>about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think that this is it and </v>

834
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:09.750
<v Speaker 2>that whatever happens to them when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having these trips.</v>

835
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:10.733
<v Speaker 2>And the way strassman did it as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more intense and most people do it </v>

836
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>because they did intravenous doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which lasts longer.</v>

837
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 2>A typical dmt trip last only about 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

838
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:21.840
<v Speaker 2>unless you just jump right back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I usually do.</v>

839
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.490
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

840
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.500
<v Speaker 2>he gave these people to intravenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>doses,</v>

841
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 2>which to take them just very deep for </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a half an hour.</v>

842
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.053
<v Speaker 2>And they all have very similar stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and similar stores to people that have </v>

843
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:33.534
<v Speaker 2>had near death experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends that have had near </v>

844
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:37.950
<v Speaker 2>death experiences and when they talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

845
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.670
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to the way I've talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to other people that have had dmt trips,</v>

846
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 2>where they are in the presence of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>divine greatness.</v>

847
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:47.190
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

848
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but that is also a chemical that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced by the brain.</v>

849
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Now this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

850
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.740
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists step in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

851
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:58.730
<v Speaker 2>your experiences is experiencing is some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a hallucination and a,</v>

852
00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.573
<v Speaker 2>they might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also might be some sort of a </v>

853
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:05.670
<v Speaker 2>chemical gateway that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces when we really don't know.</v>

854
00:46:05.671 --> 00:46:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And that might be the way the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote air quotes,</v>

855
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

856
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.740
<v Speaker 2>But for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transitions to this next stage of life.</v>

857
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Now when the anecdotal evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about is measuring up,</v>

858
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting about it is similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts over and over and over and over</v>

859
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that can remember things,</v>

860
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:26.100
<v Speaker 2>they remember this incredibly divine </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

861
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question becomes is that experience,</v>

862
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>bouncing,</v>

863
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:32.723
<v Speaker 2>bouncing around in my head a lot lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that experience a hallucination or </v>

864
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:39.870
<v Speaker 2>has that experience and actual real </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in a divine presence?</v>

865
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.733
<v Speaker 2>And does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because is it the same thing no matter </v>

866
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:45.324
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just think you're experiencing </v>

867
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>God and divine greatness because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating it in your mind versus actually</v>

868
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:52.824
<v Speaker 2>experiencing God and divine greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't the experience the exact same </v>

869
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:56.964
<v Speaker 2>thing and is is our mine locked into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of a physical thing like this </v>

870
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:01.980
<v Speaker 2>laptop?</v>

871
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I can pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can drop it.</v>

872
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I know it has weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can touch it.</v>

873
00:47:04.861 --> 00:47:05.694
<v Speaker 2>I can measure the width.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that with psychedelic </v>

874
00:47:08.791 --> 00:47:09.624
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that with transcendent </v>

875
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:11.874
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that with mystical </v>

876
00:47:13.381 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't measure them.</v>

877
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 2>You can't put them in a bag and take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>home with you,</v>

878
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.940
<v Speaker 2>but it might be the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that this is what</v>

879
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:21.774
<v Speaker 2>a many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ancient cultures experienced as </v>

880
00:47:22.861 --> 00:47:23.694
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found these of psychedelics very </v>

881
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:27.084
<v Speaker 2>odd for early on and this is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you documented your work </v>

882
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>and they date documented it very clearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of the d Egyptian work.</v>

883
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 2>They had deep understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

884
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

885
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the important things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the drugs,</v>

886
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 1>the drugs and the NDE experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my view,</v>

887
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the ND experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marcel,</v>

888
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>because there's nothing in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing obstructing it.</v>

889
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:53.430
<v Speaker 1>The dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

890
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 1>And this is where they go with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

891
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.170
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

892
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.211
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

893
00:47:58.211 --> 00:47:59.220
<v Speaker 1>you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

894
00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.680
<v Speaker 1>in these experiences and the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

895
00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:06.850
<v Speaker 1>There's problem I once it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is the wrong word,</v>

896
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:08.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

897
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.080
<v Speaker 1>with the Nde experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

898
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:16.380
<v Speaker 1>absolutely joe six pack everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people,</v>

899
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.373
<v Speaker 1>many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them even atheists go through </v>

900
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 1>this and come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally transformed their whole lives,</v>

901
00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 1>have changed by with the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is for the most part,</v>

902
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have this,</v>

903
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's lasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformational value.</v>

904
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people it does sometimes.</v>

905
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

906
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the John Hopkins study showed that a lot</v>

907
00:48:37.761 --> 00:48:39.590
<v Speaker 2>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like decades later,</v>

908
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I know a vaseline improved quality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

909
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:42.763
<v Speaker 2>different outlook on things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially when you're dealing with </v>

910
00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:46.430
<v Speaker 2>terminally ill patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

911
00:48:46.431 --> 00:48:47.264
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've given it to terminally ill </v>

912
00:48:47.931 --> 00:48:48.764
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant lessening of anxiety and </v>

913
00:48:51.231 --> 00:48:52.250
<v Speaker 2>fear of death.</v>

914
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

915
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.340
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the hallucination,</v>

916
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.270
<v Speaker 1>this is another scam by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the so called rationalists,</v>

917
00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:00.104
<v Speaker 1>who in fact the not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that it's a hallucination and </v>

918
00:49:02.631 --> 00:49:06.650
<v Speaker 1>what's a hallucination and what's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's its evolutionary value?</v>

919
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Why should they be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the hallucination gene?</v>

920
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.710
<v Speaker 1>This is all bullshit actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it actually is,</v>

921
00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.890
<v Speaker 1>is not based upon reason as they liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they like to,</v>

922
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.553
<v Speaker 1>as they promote themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is actually is the </v>

923
00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:23.450
<v Speaker 1>rationalization of their own inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>emptiness.</v>

924
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.660
<v Speaker 1>They can't handle the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be something else,</v>

925
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.823
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole intellectual lives are </v>

926
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:31.363
<v Speaker 1>consecrated to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to proving that life is indeed as </v>

927
00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:37.400
<v Speaker 1>meaningless as their own.</v>

928
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.860
<v Speaker 2>But is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it,</v>

929
00:49:38.861 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 2>they're just trying to look at some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

930
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.200
<v Speaker 2>give it a critical objective view and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go over all the possibilities.</v>

931
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:47.403
<v Speaker 2>We know that drugs do affect the mind in</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange ways and we know some </v>

932
00:49:50.261 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 2>people take drugs and it completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>distorts the reality.</v>

933
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol's a perfect example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

934
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great drug for distorting </v>

935
00:49:57.071 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can watch someone get drunk and have</v>

936
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:01.930
<v Speaker 2>a very bizarre version of the what of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're looking at.</v>

937
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:03.183
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's many drugs that change the way </v>

938
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:07.780
<v Speaker 2>people look at things like physically </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they see things.</v>

939
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 2>They will hallucinate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

940
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.563
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know that drugs have an effect on </v>

941
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:12.514
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems rational though that a </v>

942
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:14.884
<v Speaker 2>scientist would look at those things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to find some sort of a scientific </v>

943
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.250
<v Speaker 2>explanation for the chemical process is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the mind.</v>

944
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.084
<v Speaker 2>The way it's affecting the visual cortex</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the things that the person is quote </v>

945
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 2>unquote hallucinating</v>

946
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:30.770
<v Speaker 1>underlying that contention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not science in an of itself.</v>

947
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:33.800
<v Speaker 1>That is just a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is speculation.</v>

948
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:34.903
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is based upon is protecting their </v>

949
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 1>own vision of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the universe isn't,</v>

950
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 1>is an accident and anything that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystical or sore,</v>

951
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 1>so-called spiritual is hallucinatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have the answers.</v>

952
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 1>And these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

953
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.040
<v Speaker 1>are more dangerous even than </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

954
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are put it this way.</v>

955
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

956
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the Church of progress is the religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

957
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.970
<v Speaker 1>of the emotionally defective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spiritually dyslexic,</v>

958
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.800
<v Speaker 1>and the philosophically depraved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or to put it into into other terms,</v>

959
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.233
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts master I studied with </v>

960
00:51:16.041 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 1>briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to say in his Japanese accent,</v>

961
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.653
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want happiness in this crazy </v>

962
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:24.254
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not talk about moon beams to the </v>

963
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:31.871
<v Speaker 1>blind or sutton or woundings to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind music to the death.</v>

964
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And you absolutely do not talk about sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Unix.</v>

965
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.553
<v Speaker 1>They just get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what you're dealing with </v>

966
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:40.034
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these intellectually based </v>

967
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are spiritual,</v>

968
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:50.141
<v Speaker 1>emotional and philosophical unix and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

969
00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:54.830
<v Speaker 1>no surprise when they behave the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

970
00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Who surprised who surprised when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

971
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:01.560
<v Speaker 1>when the UNIX snigger behind the salt </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and,</v>

972
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.403
<v Speaker 1>and deride his passions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that with our Church of </v>

973
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.433
<v Speaker 1>our church or progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Unix take over the palace and </v>

974
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:13.880
<v Speaker 1>called their terrible disability reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the empire's cooked.</v>

975
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:14.963
<v Speaker 4>You sound like a person who's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply in the trenches against </v>

976
00:52:17.581 --> 00:52:19.590
<v Speaker 4>academics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A bitter man.</v>

977
00:52:19.591 --> 00:52:20.370
<v Speaker 4>John Anthony.</v>

978
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bitter.</v>

979
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:22.763
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just realistic and I know what's </v>

980
00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:25.674
<v Speaker 1>involved from being in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what's involved in fighting this </v>

981
00:52:30.301 --> 00:52:33.150
<v Speaker 1>particular battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've been engaged in all of these,</v>

982
00:52:33.151 --> 00:52:36.390
<v Speaker 1>all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these decades and those are yours</v>

983
00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:39.640
<v Speaker 4>cause you're dealing with archaeologists</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are trying to refute evidence.</v>

984
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:40.643
<v Speaker 1>They're all just as bad as each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I bring to the table that my </v>

985
00:52:43.591 --> 00:52:44.424
<v Speaker 1>colleague Graham Hancock was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent writer and some of the others </v>

986
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.850
<v Speaker 1>who are very brilliant people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rupert sheldrake is all to her very good</v>

987
00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:55.780
<v Speaker 1>friend and a very good scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they are not as satirists my nature</v>

988
00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:56.903
<v Speaker 1>and I am</v>

989
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:02.380
<v Speaker 4>now let's go back to this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings need to fulfill immortality</v>

990
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:03.930
<v Speaker 4>or that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

991
00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.160
<v Speaker 4>that that is our ultimate destiny to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fulfill and mortality.</v>

992
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.350
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by that?</v>

993
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if there is an afterlife,</v>

994
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.523
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we do die and then we go to this </v>

995
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 4>other place that people are seeing in </v>
<v Speaker 4>these near death experiences,</v>

996
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.683
<v Speaker 4>why do we have to do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't we just sit around and wait </v>

997
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.930
<v Speaker 4>for physical meet body to stop working </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then transcend?</v>

998
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is again,</v>

999
00:53:26.611 --> 00:53:27.444
<v Speaker 1>this gets addressed and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and David's book and the Dead Saints </v>

1000
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Chronicles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1001
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.220
<v Speaker 1>because it's our job to transcend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1002
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 1>if we don't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1003
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 1>something happens to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1004
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:40.463
<v Speaker 1>here's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the near death experiences get </v>

1005
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 1>interesting because almost none of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>are negative.</v>

1006
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:50.630
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the real evil monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are out there in this world?</v>

1007
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dick Cheney got to heaven.</v>

1008
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he talks,</v>

1009
00:53:53.971 --> 00:53:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally hilarious.</v>

1010
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm imagining if</v>

1011
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.950
<v Speaker 4>to having like tick fucking Cheney's up </v>
<v Speaker 4>here and you gotta be kidding me,</v>

1012
00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.670
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done so much.</v>

1013
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the special waterboarding.</v>

1014
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he just,</v>

1015
00:54:09.661 --> 00:54:10.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realizes it yet.</v>

1016
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seriously,</v>

1017
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.163
<v Speaker 1>this is the purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never know it from listening to </v>

1018
00:54:15.031 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the purpose of religion.</v>

1019
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a practice.</v>

1020
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you do.</v>

1021
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:24.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

1022
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:25.853
<v Speaker 1>unless you go through an Nde and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back and you start doing it in one </v>

1023
00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:29.724
<v Speaker 1>way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's my own personal conviction is </v>

1024
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:39.381
<v Speaker 1>that unless enough people are doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting somewhere with it,</v>

1025
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not as though everyone's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become enlightened.</v>

1026
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:42.354
<v Speaker 1>They probably aren't gotten going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep into the whole theories of </v>

1027
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:49.380
<v Speaker 1>reincarnation and returned and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of Egypt and part of this,</v>

1028
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 1>all of the eastern cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reincarnation,</v>

1029
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.650
<v Speaker 1>no chances are you don't make it in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

1030
00:54:55.651 --> 00:55:00.651
<v Speaker 1>But these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a report card,</v>

1031
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 1>is a divine report card where these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are measured.</v>

1032
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean Jesus says in so far heard some </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Bible.</v>

1033
00:55:08.951 --> 00:55:12.090
<v Speaker 1>This is a more as a scholarly morass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1034
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I usually try to avoid using it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as evidenced with things because it's so</v>

1035
00:55:17.371 --> 00:55:18.204
<v Speaker 1>open to interpretation and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>convoluted to begin with and who knows </v>

1036
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>what's original to it and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1037
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 1>many are called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>few are chosen,</v>

1038
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:26.963
<v Speaker 1>but those who are called who do their </v>
<v Speaker 1>work or who tried to do their work </v>

1039
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:31.703
<v Speaker 1>reaped the benefit of that on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal level that the crack epidemic </v>

1040
00:55:36.481 --> 00:55:39.690
<v Speaker 1>can't measure and don't want to measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't believe can be measured.</v>

1041
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:40.943
<v Speaker 1>But somebody with a presence is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from somebody without any </v>

1042
00:55:43.621 --> 00:55:44.454
<v Speaker 1>presence at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that in the world around you as </v>

1043
00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:47.230
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>

1044
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:49.740
<v Speaker 4>I want to bring you back around though </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm still confused.</v>

1045
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:53.470
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by it's our goal to </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve in,</v>

1046
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in mortality?</v>

1047
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.613
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean like the physical body no </v>

1048
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 4>longer dies and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe that?</v>

1049
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1050
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.480
<v Speaker 4>whatever I read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not remember what I read,</v>

1051
00:56:03.481 --> 00:56:04.314
<v Speaker 4>but what I read about the early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earliest depictions of the pharaohs </v>

1052
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.340
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they lived and extraordinary length</v>

1053
00:56:11.341 --> 00:56:13.710
<v Speaker 4>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>similar to like noah,</v>

1054
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 4>like Noah in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1055
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.600
<v Speaker 4>in the Bible was 600 years old when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>built the art.</v>

1056
00:56:18.601 --> 00:56:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1057
00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1058
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.740
<v Speaker 4>and that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a common thing.</v>

1059
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 4>And now</v>

1060
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 2>know is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the way we think of time,</v>

1061
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.013
<v Speaker 2>they had a different interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and what 600 years is to us is not </v>

1062
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 2>600 years to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it like,</v>

1063
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.553
<v Speaker 2>like in the Quran when they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>72 virgins that well you know when they </v>

1064
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 2>expression 72 virgins is not really 72 </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that with 72 virgins means.</v>

1065
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Well it's interesting cause it's 72 </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1066
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.530
<v Speaker 2>what it means is a large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a shit load.</v>

1067
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.413
<v Speaker 2>Like someone saying a shit load,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have 72 virgins and having like </v>

1068
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:52.061
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1069
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:53.540
<v Speaker 2>am I gonna do it all them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a large number.</v>

1071
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:56.284
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1072
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 2>the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1073
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not the actual number 72 it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a euphemism for a large number.</v>

1074
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:03.723
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the theories of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those different strange numbers in the </v>

1075
00:57:06.371 --> 00:57:07.204
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know any better than anyone </v>

1076
00:57:08.411 --> 00:57:12.840
<v Speaker 1>else as far as I know the pharaohs lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary lifespans and of course there's</v>

1077
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:13.683
<v Speaker 1>no evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical evidence of the pharaohs does </v>

1078
00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.653
<v Speaker 1>Nacho do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the wine rule has ruled and </v>

1079
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so hard when they ruled,</v>

1080
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.150
<v Speaker 1>there's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we simply don't know.</v>

1081
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.680
<v Speaker 1>The Tibetans have accounts if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe that Tibetans and I tend to,</v>

1082
00:57:29.681 --> 00:57:34.681
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why they should lie of great</v>
<v Speaker 1>lamas who live several hundred years and</v>

1083
00:57:34.781 --> 00:57:37.060
<v Speaker 1>go when they choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1084
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it's a,</v>

1085
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say it's,</v>

1086
00:57:43.991 --> 00:57:44.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1087
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:47.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no more than a kind of mental,</v>

1088
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:50.360
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting hypothesis like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigfoot,</v>

1089
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.333
<v Speaker 1>but who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only thing that actually counts </v>

1090
00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:54.940
<v Speaker 1>as the inner work.</v>

1091
00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it.</v>

1092
00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not doing it and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure yourself either,</v>

1093
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:04.900
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you are looking for results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's already a way of not getting them</v>

1094
00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.133
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very delicate and yet profound </v>

1095
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.940
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she got to a good zen master.</v>

1096
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.980
<v Speaker 1>This stuff is still around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

1097
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:16.990
<v Speaker 1>there are mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's my own,</v>

1098
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:17.913
<v Speaker 1>my own focus as you probably know or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't because the gird Jeff </v>

1099
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Work of the cross when I came across </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard javelin,</v>

1100
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:24.463
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the first person I'd ever </v>

1101
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:27.814
<v Speaker 1>encountered posthumously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died in 49 and I found out about his </v>

1102
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:32.530
<v Speaker 1>work in the 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1103
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.490
<v Speaker 1>who was as contemptuous of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization as I was.</v>

1104
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:40.930
<v Speaker 1>The difference was that he knew how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in it and I didn't end at a certain</v>

1105
00:58:40.931 --> 00:58:44.580
<v Speaker 1>point point I figured out particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're talking about before the,</v>

1106
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the my life in the trenches.</v>

1107
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Good subtitle for something.</v>

1108
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I still don't understand what you mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>about achieving in mortality.</v>

1109
00:58:53.551 --> 00:58:55.680
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not talking about physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>inventory,</v>

1110
00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.553
<v Speaker 2>we mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about someone living </v>

1111
00:58:57.601 --> 00:59:00.710
<v Speaker 2>in a thousand years and plus absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1112
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1113
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 2>they promote transcending and</v>

1114
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:06.833
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about a level of </v>

1115
00:59:07.601 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that transcends death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body dies.</v>

1116
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And that understanding is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding is where you are.</v>

1117
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:20.463
<v Speaker 1>I mean the drugs do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have these moments that with the </v>

1118
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 1>body you come back cause he got ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trip.</v>

1119
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1120
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 1>it's an eternal trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ancients talk about that all the</v>

1121
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:33.980
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even even in their mythology,</v>

1122
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.830
<v Speaker 1>which it was always taken this as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanciful,</v>

1123
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:39.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the pyramid texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1124
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.390
<v Speaker 1>the script reads that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1125
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 1>when the Pharaoh dies and the Pharaoh </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1126
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 1>let's say the embodiment of the realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enlightened sold.</v>

1127
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 1>When the Pharaoh dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his bar unites with his car,</v>

1128
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 1>his spirit unites with his essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a star.</v>

1129
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:56.933
<v Speaker 1>What star and traveled with raw across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky and his boat of millions of </v>

1130
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:05.750
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an in fact,</v>

1131
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I've often wondered if the Egyptians </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually knew what he was being,</v>

1132
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:10.303
<v Speaker 1>what they were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the stars themselves are the </v>

1133
01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:17.531
<v Speaker 1>realizations of enlightened souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as good as any other ex explanation</v>

1134
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1135
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's simply balls of gas.</v>

1136
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:21.344
<v Speaker 1>How did that get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That automatically at some point </v>

1137
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1138
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>coalesce into galaxies and Nebula and </v>
<v Speaker 1>universes and the whole thing goes on.</v>

1139
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Meaninglessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1140
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.360
<v Speaker 4>well I don't think anybody thinks it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningless,</v>

1141
01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:36.850
<v Speaker 4>but it is kind of fascinating that stars</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

1142
01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:40.150
<v Speaker 4>So the only reason why people are alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are made of stardust,</v>

1143
01:00:40.151 --> 01:00:40.984
<v Speaker 4>which has just where you are in deed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible to think that the seeds of </v>

1144
01:00:43.781 --> 01:00:48.781
<v Speaker 4>human life and all carbon life in fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>come from a star exploding like wow.</v>

1145
01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:52.240
<v Speaker 4>Like everything that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the sun,</v>

1146
01:00:52.241 --> 01:00:55.660
<v Speaker 4>the sun is a seed for future life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's bananas.</v>

1147
01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1148
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.833
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've answered your own question </v>

1149
01:00:59.941 --> 01:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1150
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.093
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1151
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>that understanding and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even call it a philosophy,</v>

1152
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>it's an understanding by people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand more than we do.</v>

1153
01:01:09.301 --> 01:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Certainly more than I do,</v>

1154
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.673
<v Speaker 4>but isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you say that's our goal to </v>

1155
01:01:13.521 --> 01:01:15.060
<v Speaker 4>achieve in mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds,</v>

1156
01:01:15.061 --> 01:01:17.320
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like we're going to get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway no matter what.</v>

1157
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1158
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>actually with the nds know what had I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>

1159
01:01:22.931 --> 01:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1160
01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had their,</v>

1161
01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>their experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had their x number of minutes of</v>

1162
01:01:28.241 --> 01:01:29.074
<v Speaker 1>grace and come back and come back </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed and realize that they have </v>

1163
01:01:34.661 --> 01:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>to live their lives differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even talk about,</v>

1164
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

1165
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>the future or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1166
01:01:40.511 --> 01:01:41.344
<v Speaker 1>this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a very big thing that not </v>

1167
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.034
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that not many people ever densely </v>

1168
01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the effort,</v>

1169
01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effort is the effort and it's,</v>

1170
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.480
<v Speaker 1>it's on the scorecard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1171
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.633
<v Speaker 1>it's not so different from everybody who</v>
<v Speaker 1>picks up a vial then isn't going to end </v>

1172
01:02:01.511 --> 01:02:02.344
<v Speaker 1>up in [inaudible] in Carnegie Hall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who picks up a baseball bat </v>

1173
01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to play center field for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mets or any other team.</v>

1174
01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:09.903
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the effort that counts and </v>

1175
01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:13.054
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a certain kind of directed and </v>

1176
01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>intelligent effort that is painful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own way,</v>

1177
01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but carries its own reward.</v>

1178
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.983
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it manifests in a kind of presence and </v>

1179
01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>just in our daily lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with people who are not consciously</v>

1180
01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing it,</v>

1181
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>they have a different level of presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you notice it when you meet them.</v>

1182
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1183
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you think these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians,</v>

1184
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.603
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians that you believe how to </v>

1185
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:52.680
<v Speaker 2>achieve this incredible state of mind or</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

1186
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you think that they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>to achieve that?</v>

1187
01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Like why were they so advanced?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why were they so beyond what we think of</v>

1188
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:01.464
<v Speaker 2>when we think of even the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being living 34 plus thousand </v>

1189
01:03:04.861 --> 01:03:06.860
<v Speaker 2>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that,</v>

1190
01:03:06.861 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 2>how did they achieve that?</v>

1191
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:10.250
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1192
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we can see,</v>

1193
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>all we can see is the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what they did.</v>

1194
01:03:17.081 --> 01:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>When we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you really understand Egypt,</v>

1195
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>even to the extent that I do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1196
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:25.263
<v Speaker 1>you regarded as miraculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's don't see how beings ostensibly </v>

1197
01:03:28.961 --> 01:03:29.794
<v Speaker 1>like ourselves should even imagine such </v>
<v Speaker 1>things much less be able to do it and </v>

1198
01:03:34.931 --> 01:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'll pitch my trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1199
01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:38.853
<v Speaker 1>I often start a lecture off by saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Egypt is like sex that gets </v>

1200
01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>everybody's attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it like Sachs?</v>

1201
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Because you can read books about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's inflammation.</v>

1202
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>All of sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at pictures.</v>

1203
01:03:52.511 --> 01:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind or a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of information.</v>

1204
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:57.750
<v Speaker 1>But until you've experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1205
01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you do not and cannot understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Egypt is like that magically,</v>

1206
01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>that magical leads up series is as close</v>
<v Speaker 1>as anyone has ever come to communicating</v>

1207
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:10.263
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wonder and the magic that is Egypt </v>

1208
01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>as anyone has ever has ever.</v>

1209
01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's way head and shoulders above what </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else has done.</v>

1210
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's my genius part in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>chances doing in its entirety.</v>

1211
01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:22.324
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1212
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.150
<v Speaker 1>simple just ideas and I play a big role </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

1213
01:04:25.151 --> 01:04:30.151
<v Speaker 1>but it's early chances baby and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1214
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.983
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1215
01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but at the visit to Egypt at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks there,</v>

1216
01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I can talk from now till Doomsday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm about in the process of doing.</v>

1217
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing,</v>

1218
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>nothing that I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you come,</v>

1219
01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>can come even remotely close to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like to be two weeks in Egypt,</v>

1220
01:04:52.571 --> 01:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>day after day after day after day in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of,</v>

1221
01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>of sacred art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

1222
01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>of this quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's nowhere else in on the left.</v>

1223
01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that China and India and all of</v>

1224
01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>these places had not pyramids and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of structure.</v>

1225
01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.060
<v Speaker 1>The nature of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange.</v>

1226
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:12.023
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of freak of nature as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>were at all desert except this little </v>

1227
01:05:15.701 --> 01:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>strip of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1228
01:05:16.661 --> 01:05:17.494
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the delta that until recently </v>

1229
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>was impenetrable swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's practically unattainable.</v>

1230
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And the food denial floods and the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumps out of the ground and under the,</v>

1231
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:32.730
<v Speaker 1>under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1232
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:33.570
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1233
01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:34.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a series of genuinely enlightened </v>

1234
01:05:39.341 --> 01:05:40.174
<v Speaker 1>rulers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least pretty close to enlightened </v>

1235
01:05:41.691 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>drill is ruling them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all lasts for 3,500</v>

1236
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how did they live?</v>

1237
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>You see everything that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1238
01:05:48.881 --> 01:05:49.714
<v Speaker 1>until quite recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no such things as jobs that </v>

1239
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>were trades and crafts and skills and </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts and everybody.</v>

1240
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1241
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:59.463
<v Speaker 1>and in Europe that the combination of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressive church and then oppressive </v>

1242
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>nobility kept everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1243
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 1>immersed in serfdom in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1244
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.613
<v Speaker 1>But what people actually did with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives was in some sense or another </v>

1245
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 1>transformational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

1246
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of smarts to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>patent.</v>

1247
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>All of these things that people used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do as a matter of course,</v>

1248
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.560
<v Speaker 1>and in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it,</v>

1249
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.043
<v Speaker 1>you'll see it carved into the walls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks these are the scenes of </v>

1250
01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:31.240
<v Speaker 1>daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they are scenes of daily life with</v>

1251
01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the decodable as transformational </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

1252
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>So anything that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and boy,</v>

1253
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you're doing marshal your martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a highly developed skill.</v>

1254
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>You will are somebody that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be if you were,</v>

1255
01:06:45.741 --> 01:06:46.574
<v Speaker 1>didn't have that scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were doing a full podcast and </v>

1256
01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 1>what you did for a living was flipping </v>
<v Speaker 1>burgers at Mcdonald's,</v>

1257
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>

1258
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1259
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.613
<v Speaker 1>you've been doing your homework without </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even thinking that it was </v>

1260
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause any,</v>

1261
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:01.774
<v Speaker 1>anything that you're involved in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you go at with a quest for </v>

1262
01:07:08.381 --> 01:07:12.820
<v Speaker 1>perfection of whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has this transformational value.</v>

1263
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.710
<v Speaker 1>And when you recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know it,</v>

1264
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:16.930
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know it intellectually,</v>

1265
01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:20.350
<v Speaker 1>when you can articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't fit,</v>

1266
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>it implements the actually the activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1267
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>So what's possible even to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be an,</v>

1268
01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.380
<v Speaker 1>or you could be an enlightened burger </v>
<v Speaker 1>flipper and the sewer fees are very good</v>

1269
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:32.950
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1270
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>the sophie is in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not as enlarged by sorry,</v>

1271
01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:40.480
<v Speaker 1>is in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not have it.</v>

1272
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.440
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1273
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you can practice waking up as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1274
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.950
<v Speaker 1>in the midst of the most mundane thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be.</v>

1275
01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be an enlightened garbage,</v>

1276
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>garbage collector as long as you knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were doing.</v>

1277
01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1278
01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's collected.</v>

1279
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.583
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect the garbage consciously than it </v>

1280
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:04.000
<v Speaker 1>is to just do it.</v>

1281
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Resentfully because that's the only job </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can get all the right.</v>

1282
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talking,</v>

1283
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as though this is,</v>

1284
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:16.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not as though this is anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually new.</v>

1285
01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:19.310
<v Speaker 1>It's is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the oldest idea that ever was.</v>

1286
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.413
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that people have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing for thousands and thousands of </v>

1287
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

1288
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:30.310
<v Speaker 1>going into the whole thing of precession</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the and the and the ages,</v>

1289
01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>particularly as expressed plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the golden age,</v>

1290
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.660
<v Speaker 1>silver age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bronze Age,</v>

1291
01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:36.494
<v Speaker 1>and an iron age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hindus do it and rather more </v>

1292
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:40.154
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget exactly the name there on the </v>

1293
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:44.930
<v Speaker 1>tip of my tongue of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those ages,</v>

1294
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but if they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1295
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.193
<v Speaker 1>let's say analogous to our seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if you live where I do and </v>

1296
01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>not in California where it's all one </v>
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>

1297
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:59.120
<v Speaker 1>but the seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guarantees at the Yugas,</v>

1298
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the Yugas and that's right.</v>

1299
01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's if,</v>

1300
01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1301
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:06.230
<v Speaker 1>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the seasons,</v>

1302
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a very different thing to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>roses in June than it is in January.</v>

1303
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It's the same effort when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the people you know,</v>

1304
01:09:15.111 --> 01:09:19.340
<v Speaker 1>at waking up and all of the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a dark age.</v>

1305
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.263
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the Kali Yoga as far as I'm </v>

1306
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:23.414
<v Speaker 1>concerned to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a spiritual nature now with </v>

1307
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:29.474
<v Speaker 1>all of these forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of these forces lined up </v>

1308
01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:33.800
<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not consciously of course,</v>

1309
01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>but unconsciously it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

1310
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredibly difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually practice a genuine,</v>

1311
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:45.200
<v Speaker 1>the genuine spiritual doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1312
01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:46.034
<v Speaker 1>they have to get interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only that small chunk of </v>

1313
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.360
<v Speaker 1>it of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to try to do it,</v>

1314
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.640
<v Speaker 2>and you have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have the folklore,</v>

1315
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.430
<v Speaker 1>the time and the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1316
01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:55.653
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The focus and the weld and all the rest </v>

1317
01:09:57.071 --> 01:09:58.900
<v Speaker 1>of the things and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1318
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>so growing roses in January takes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more effort than to get to the same rows</v>

1319
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:09.850
<v Speaker 1>than it takes in June when the jumping </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the ground.</v>

1320
01:10:09.851 --> 01:10:11.620
<v Speaker 1>So my guess is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's only gas,</v>

1321
01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.640
<v Speaker 1>it's speculation that in these higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of these higher periods of,</v>

1322
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.260
<v Speaker 1>of know Golden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silver,</v>

1323
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.170
<v Speaker 1>bronze and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just much easier.</v>

1324
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It is much easier for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize what's demanded of them and to</v>

1325
01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:32.050
<v Speaker 1>do it than it is in the middle of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1326
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.890
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1327
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:33.700
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1328
01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:37.810
<v Speaker 1>from a spiritual point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual but brightly lit,</v>

1329
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.190
<v Speaker 1>brightly an illuminated but brightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>lit,</v>

1330
01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.540
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark age.</v>

1331
01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1332
01:10:44.261 --> 01:10:44.870
<v Speaker 1>where we are,</v>

1333
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:45.703
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the influence that Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 2>had clearly on Greece and clearly on a </v>

1334
01:10:48.921 --> 01:10:53.060
<v Speaker 2>lot of other civilizations where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally came to Egypt to learn,</v>

1335
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:57.980
<v Speaker 2>if each app wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would civilization be like?</v>

1336
01:10:57.981 --> 01:10:58.814
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a unique place in that </v>

1337
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:01.813
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really no where that you can </v>

1338
01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:04.784
<v Speaker 2>compare that has the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistication as far as the structures </v>

1339
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:10.720
<v Speaker 2>and the ancient in the ancient world has</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even,</v>

1340
01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they're,</v>

1341
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.240
<v Speaker 2>what they created was undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1342
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Giza,</v>

1343
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:19.020
<v Speaker 2>the Great Pyramid of Giza as 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>

1344
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:21.810
<v Speaker 2>stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they way between two and 80 tons.</v>

1345
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how that's insane.</v>

1346
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:26.303
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the level of sophistication and </v>

1347
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 2>creating something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1348
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I've only seen it in photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the greatest photographs I've</v>

1349
01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:36.780
<v Speaker 2>ever seen is from someone with a gopro </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing on the top of it.</v>

1350
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.913
<v Speaker 2>So you get this kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a sense of how immense it </v>

1351
01:11:41.221 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly is.</v>

1352
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just think about how,</v>

1353
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 2>how incredible that must have been when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it's covered with smooth</v>

1354
01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 2>limestone in four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cut it all off.</v>

1355
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1356
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:52.043
<v Speaker 2>what you're seeing is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an undeniable mastery of physical </v>

1357
01:11:56.611 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 2>things to the point where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you just,</v>

1358
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 2>it makes your head spin because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1359
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:05.220
<v Speaker 2>people say we can do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1360
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:06.083
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we kind of understand that it's </v>

1361
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:10.950
<v Speaker 2>been done and that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do pretty immense things.</v>

1362
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.100
<v Speaker 2>We have some pretty incredible tractors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and machines and everything like that.</v>

1363
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:16.360
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't have those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1364
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.430
<v Speaker 2>As far as we know,</v>

1365
01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.960
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might've had something else.</v>

1366
01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>What do you think they had?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1367
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think about,</v>

1368
01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:25.940
<v Speaker 2>do just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have like some hypothesis,</v>

1369
01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:28.360
<v Speaker 2>some theories in your head about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction methods?</v>

1370
01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Some a bit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually from Tibet.</v>

1371
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.280
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a funny little book </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done some lectures at,</v>

1372
01:12:38.281 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 1>at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1373
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.310
<v Speaker 1>what is it called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1374
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 1>in Joshua tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1375
01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 1>about that event?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1376
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:46.403
<v Speaker 1>it's a contact in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're mostly interested in the UFO </v>

1377
01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:53.010
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the place itself,</v>

1378
01:12:53.011 --> 01:12:58.011
<v Speaker 1>Joshua retreat center is founded by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting guy who was sort of the</v>

1379
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:00.871
<v Speaker 1>Tibetan Krishnamurti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1380
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting little book he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>and terribly written,</v>

1381
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:06.870
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his studies in Tibet.</v>

1382
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of his little book he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

1383
01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:10.224
<v Speaker 1>he studying with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the llamas he just described </v>

1384
01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 1>certain of the certain of the things he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has seen them do.</v>

1385
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And I see no particular reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismiss what he says.</v>

1386
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.000
<v Speaker 1>He's talking from experience and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ring of veracity to it.</v>

1387
01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1388
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 1>going into an underground chamber that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has no lights or electricity or anything</v>

1389
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1390
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.350
<v Speaker 1>That's all lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually go to Egypt.</v>

1391
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>We have these deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep shaft tombs that go down and around</v>

1392
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and all like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>

1393
01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:40.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they light the thing up?</v>

1394
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.903
<v Speaker 1>Can't have had torches or would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have used up all of the oxygen </v>

1395
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.640
<v Speaker 1>and it would have smoked up the ceilings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the rest of it.</v>

1396
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 1>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well mirrors,</v>

1397
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 1>no mirrors will do and then you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>silvered mirror is for that to go around</v>

1398
01:13:53.281 --> 01:13:54.114
<v Speaker 1>corners there other gypsy caves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seville that are four or five rooms in </v>

1399
01:13:57.751 --> 01:14:01.260
<v Speaker 1>that are lit with mirrors from on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1400
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I used to joke and say,</v>

1401
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:04.074
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an inner light and joking but </v>

1402
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's what it was.</v>

1403
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 1>But the producers and talks about other</v>

1404
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.023
<v Speaker 3>Lama's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these witness doing incredible feats of </v>

1405
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.273
<v Speaker 3>that you couldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that you just couldn't do in </v>

1406
01:14:20.051 --> 01:14:23.470
<v Speaker 3>your ordinary state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably you as a martial artist,</v>

1407
01:14:23.471 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I've had moments or witnessed people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do things that are for anybody else.</v>

1408
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1409
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:32.110
<v Speaker 3>but they don't light up tunnel snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't light up tunnel.</v>

1410
01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can do,</v>

1411
01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.350
<v Speaker 3>they can do physical things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

1412
01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.260
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're extraordinary.</v>

1413
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 3>They're almost miraculous that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else could do them.</v>

1414
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

1415
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.043
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really important point where </v>

1416
01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:46.084
<v Speaker 2>you're saying about the construction </v>
<v Speaker 2>methods that they used where they did </v>

1417
01:14:49.531 --> 01:14:53.550
<v Speaker 2>have these long tunnels and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>passages and these places,</v>

1418
01:14:53.551 --> 01:14:54.384
<v Speaker 2>but somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they managed to navigate these things </v>

1419
01:14:57.331 --> 01:15:01.440
<v Speaker 2>without leaving any marks or soot from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from torches,</v>

1420
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:05.940
<v Speaker 2>which are everywhere else where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>use candles or anywhere else.</v>

1421
01:15:05.941 --> 01:15:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1422
01:15:06.811 --> 01:15:10.170
<v Speaker 2>you didn't the Sistine Chapel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the entire ceiling was covered with</v>

1423
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:10.741
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1424
01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:11.574
<v Speaker 2>they had to clean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to prepare it so people could see it </v>

1425
01:15:14.311 --> 01:15:15.990
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

1426
01:15:15.991 --> 01:15:16.824
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really fascinating to think that </v>

1427
01:15:18.151 --> 01:15:18.984
<v Speaker 2>they had some other method of </v>
<v Speaker 2>illumination that we just haven't </v>

1428
01:15:21.361 --> 01:15:22.194
<v Speaker 2>discovered yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what they did or how they </v>

1429
01:15:23.281 --> 01:15:23.720
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>

1430
01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.553
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you look at a jillion other things </v>

1431
01:15:27.021 --> 01:15:28.610
<v Speaker 3>when you particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is again,</v>

1432
01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:31.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why the swinks theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1433
01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:31.894
<v Speaker 3>is so is so contentious to these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so dangerous to these guys because the </v>

1434
01:15:36.171 --> 01:15:38.270
<v Speaker 3>swings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carving the spanx is one thing,</v>

1435
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:39.343
<v Speaker 3>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>limestones are relatively resilient </v>

1436
01:15:42.051 --> 01:15:44.210
<v Speaker 3>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you relatively soft stone enough?</v>

1437
01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Guys with chisels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're copper chiseled could do</v>

1438
01:15:47.451 --> 01:15:49.730
<v Speaker 3>that given enough time and enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

1439
01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.510
<v Speaker 3>But the temple die the side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1440
01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 3>and are built of stones half the size of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this room slotted into place like pieces</v>

1441
01:16:00.411 --> 01:16:04.220
<v Speaker 3>of a jigsaw puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is unbelievable.</v>

1442
01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.410
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you just said is really important.</v>

1443
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Copper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>copper tools,</v>

1444
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:10.190
<v Speaker 3>that's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Copper tempered with arsenic.</v>

1445
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:11.323
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those same copper tools to </v>

1446
01:16:13.521 --> 01:16:17.630
<v Speaker 3>supposedly are supposedly used for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for carving the granite,</v>

1447
01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:18.973
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to Egypt actually usually get </v>

1448
01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:21.770
<v Speaker 3>you a huge audience.</v>

1449
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:22.603
<v Speaker 3>Got to Juggle Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip together and come on to people </v>

1450
01:16:25.071 --> 01:16:28.130
<v Speaker 3>listening to this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have a test.</v>

1451
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.833
<v Speaker 3>Too many fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well 90% of them would be great to 10% </v>

1452
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.110
<v Speaker 3>will keep out the 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just do it,</v>

1453
01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.170
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prepare,</v>

1454
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.453
<v Speaker 3>filter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1455
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prepare a filter,</v>

1456
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:42.710
<v Speaker 3>get them in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare a filter.</v>

1457
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.650
<v Speaker 3>And how many people when you taking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

1458
01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 3>I have a Max of 24 hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1459
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not more than that is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unmanageable.</v>

1460
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.333
<v Speaker 3>And when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one thing after the other and </v>

1461
01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:57.200
<v Speaker 3>it's totally safe to go to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Narcan right now.</v>

1462
01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a safe as Los Angeles.</v>

1463
01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.613
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were anywhere else here and then </v>

1464
01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.760
<v Speaker 3>didn't Dumbfuckistan it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1465
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:08.900
<v Speaker 3>this is tough work for Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're Americans too,</v>

1466
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.720
<v Speaker 3>of all people to be afraid of going </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

1467
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:15.900
<v Speaker 3>We're worried about Islamic terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than anything because we then,</v>

1468
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.843
<v Speaker 3>it's here.</v>

1469
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.103
<v Speaker 3>It's already here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Islamic terrorism is itself a tiny </v>

1470
01:17:21.561 --> 01:17:25.610
<v Speaker 3>little bit of the terrorism that goes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a daily basis.</v>

1471
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:26.743
<v Speaker 3>You pick up that you opened the internet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's some nutcase kid somewhere </v>

1472
01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:33.000
<v Speaker 3>or another shooting down a mall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1473
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 3>the terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrorist,</v>

1474
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:40.580
<v Speaker 3>the known terrorists have accounted for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even the statistic,</v>

1475
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.850
<v Speaker 3>it's an x number of people that they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone after.</v>

1476
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1477
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 3>here in this crazy violent country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never safe anywhere.</v>

1478
01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Schools aren't safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>malls aren't safe.</v>

1479
01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:54.310
<v Speaker 3>What's safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1480
01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:56.480
<v Speaker 3>So Kira has some nice hotels too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1481
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hotels.</v>

1482
01:17:57.711 --> 01:17:58.544
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We stay at a place to actually right </v>

1483
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 3>across a stone's throw from the pyramids</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1484
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.800
<v Speaker 3>So you can look at the pyramid out your </v>
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>

1485
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1486
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.883
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>

1487
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.420
<v Speaker 4>When I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1488
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:10.290
<v Speaker 4>the Great Pyramid are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at the,</v>

1489
01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.133
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure that I've seen online or </v>

1490
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:15.230
<v Speaker 4>in your videos or things along those </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

1491
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 4>What's shocking to me is how each,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is going to be a weird thing to</v>

1492
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:20.864
<v Speaker 4>say how Egyptian it looks and how Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 4>stands alone in this very distinctive </v>

1493
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.540
<v Speaker 4>way and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the construction methods,</v>

1494
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.403
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that just the intricacy of the building </v>

1495
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:33.770
<v Speaker 4>and these pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1496
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:34.783
<v Speaker 4>people talk about the Mayan Pyramids and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to [inaudible] needs and it's </v>

1497
01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:39.620
<v Speaker 4>an amazing place and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful and crazy to look at,</v>

1498
01:18:39.621 --> 01:18:42.920
<v Speaker 4>but it pales in comparison to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures of Egypt.</v>

1499
01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything pales in comparison with it.</v>

1500
01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.800
<v Speaker 3>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well as I said,</v>

1501
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:54.120
<v Speaker 3>because it was in a kind of a blessing </v>
<v Speaker 3>lung.</v>

1502
01:18:54.121 --> 01:18:55.740
<v Speaker 3>It had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had a philosophy,</v>

1503
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:56.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had a spiritual philosophy </v>

1504
01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:01.320
<v Speaker 3>underpinning it that had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had the,</v>

1505
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.950
<v Speaker 3>that that had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say that had the,</v>

1506
01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.570
<v Speaker 3>that united the people in their entirety</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that they weren't,</v>

1507
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminals and murderers and stuff like </v>

1508
01:19:11.941 --> 01:19:12.774
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But basically the people were united in </v>

1509
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:16.374
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their faith and delighted in their </v>

1510
01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:21.240
<v Speaker 3>belief errata this when Egypt was sixth </v>
<v Speaker 3>century BC,</v>

1511
01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:26.490
<v Speaker 3>the rod is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Egypt is already in steep decline as</v>

1512
01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:29.460
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptians of the happiest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthiest,</v>

1513
01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:30.294
<v Speaker 3>and most religious of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't the Egyptian Chamber of </v>

1514
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Commerce that was telling him to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was a patriotic Greek,</v>

1515
01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:37.403
<v Speaker 3>but it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a combination of the </v>

1516
01:19:40.261 --> 01:19:41.094
<v Speaker 3>philosophy wedded to it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a society that was protected on all </v>

1517
01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:49.710
<v Speaker 3>four sides and almost an almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>impregnable.</v>

1518
01:19:49.711 --> 01:19:50.544
<v Speaker 3>It was conquered a couple of times over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the course of 3000 years for a </v>

1519
01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:56.320
<v Speaker 3>relatively brief period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1520
01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.720
<v Speaker 3>and the food jumped out of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Nile flooded and took practically no</v>

1521
01:20:00.721 --> 01:20:01.554
<v Speaker 3>work and that I made a a quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantial population but gave them </v>

1522
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>months of free time every,</v>

1523
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how did it all go wrong?</v>

1524
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the colleague Ogas,</v>

1525
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whatever that whatever period Egypt </v>

1526
01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:17.844
<v Speaker 1>is assigned to is on a downhill slope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just plain was on a downhill slope </v>

1527
01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:23.363
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch it transform in front of </v>

1528
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 1>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1529
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:27.853
<v Speaker 1>it disintegrates as a coherent religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>rises in another form that we call </v>

1530
01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:34.464
<v Speaker 1>Christianity actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and could see it happening in front of </v>

1531
01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 1>your nose with Coptic Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 1>arising.</v>

1532
01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:43.660
<v Speaker 1>All the rest of the stuff gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely decadent under the Romans and</v>

1533
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.960
<v Speaker 1>syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

1534
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:47.423
<v Speaker 1>Gibbon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'd given in decline and fall of </v>

1535
01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:52.170
<v Speaker 1>the Roman empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about the grand jury,</v>

1536
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.173
<v Speaker 1>the glory of Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolute nonsense or totally </v>

1537
01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.630
<v Speaker 1>with near total nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Grand Juror Rome.</v>

1538
01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were building coliseums and elected</v>

1539
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 1>and wanted to torture in order to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>die gladiators kill each other.</v>

1540
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And they built good roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Ron was a three ring bro,</v>

1541
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 1>three ring bureaucracy actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the beginning of the end.</v>

1542
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And Europe anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very traceable.</v>

1543
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.883
<v Speaker 1>The the Asian countries less so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they too have high civilizations </v>

1544
01:21:22.951 --> 01:21:23.784
<v Speaker 1>that decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Europe you see kind of a </v>

1545
01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:30.270
<v Speaker 1>turnaround in the renaissance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very impossible to actually date.</v>

1546
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you have it leading in a sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1547
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.373
<v Speaker 1>in a one very one sided development in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which in which technology advances by </v>

1548
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:43.254
<v Speaker 1>leaps and bounds and everything else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably a lot worse than it was a </v>

1549
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.720
<v Speaker 1>couple of hundred years ago from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From every spiritual psychological point</v>

1550
01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:55.554
<v Speaker 1>of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a lot worse off than let's say </v>

1551
01:21:57.451 --> 01:21:58.710
<v Speaker 1>the colonial American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.850
<v Speaker 6>Steve really thinks so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The depictions of the colonial Americans</v>

1553
01:22:01.851 --> 01:22:02.960
<v Speaker 6>by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1554
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.090
<v Speaker 6>by the ancient people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When,</v>

1555
01:22:06.091 --> 01:22:06.621
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

1556
01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:09.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who was it that described the atrocities</v>

1557
01:22:09.801 --> 01:22:12.110
<v Speaker 6>that Columbus and his crude had done?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1558
01:22:12.111 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 6>what preacher?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Priest,</v>

1559
01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.140
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>loads of the mature,</v>

1560
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:17.180
<v Speaker 6>horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horrific things.</v>

1561
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.700
<v Speaker 6>Those are the conquerors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1562
01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:21.860
<v Speaker 6>We're not talking about the settlers and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Indians.</v>

1563
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:22.510
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1564
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:25.460
<v Speaker 6>and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this already pulled that stuff.</v>

1565
01:22:25.461 --> 01:22:29.780
<v Speaker 6>Montezuma was a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Blotter of 80,000</v>

1566
01:22:29.781 --> 01:22:32.420
<v Speaker 6>slaves after they built Tia to con.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How he say that.</v>

1567
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.530
<v Speaker 6>Te Te,</v>
<v Speaker 6>te Lacan Teal,</v>

1568
01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:38.360
<v Speaker 6>teal con this I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this I don't know about and I don't know</v>

1569
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.253
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they say my bad people to loads of </v>

1570
01:22:42.081 --> 01:22:43.760
<v Speaker 6>bad people that just didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Internet</v>

1571
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.333
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They certainly didn't have the Internet </v>

1572
01:22:46.481 --> 01:22:48.790
<v Speaker 1>and lots of other goodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have.</v>

1573
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1574
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:51.424
<v Speaker 1>but that was a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say about the populous in general </v>

1575
01:22:57.610 --> 01:23:01.210
<v Speaker 1>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A certain gravitas about them.</v>

1576
01:23:01.211 --> 01:23:04.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain presence that is of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our great,</v>

1577
01:23:04.241 --> 01:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>great grandfathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not mine cause they were in Hungary</v>

1578
01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:07.750
<v Speaker 1>at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My great,</v>

1579
01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a certain,</v>

1580
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:11.590
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1581
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Emerson self reliance.</v>

1582
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:15.724
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a piece of her I meanwhile of </v>

1583
01:23:17.381 --> 01:23:18.214
<v Speaker 1>course the weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the slaves in the south and they're </v>

1584
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:24.100
<v Speaker 1>murdering all the Indians and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the billionaires as is their fashion</v>

1585
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>or beating up on their Irish immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

1586
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why perhaps slaves when they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistreat their,</v>

1587
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.320
<v Speaker 1>their work is in build there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>and build all of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1589
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 1>their railroads across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nevertheless,</v>

1590
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.373
<v Speaker 1>there's a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say Grub a test is almost the only </v>

1591
01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:44.394
<v Speaker 1>word I can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's not as though it's </v>

1592
01:23:45.181 --> 01:23:47.280
<v Speaker 1>intellectually advanced or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1593
01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:48.563
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain seeming solidity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 19th century America then than there </v>

1594
01:23:56.221 --> 01:23:58.380
<v Speaker 1>is now in this crazy chaos.</v>

1595
01:23:58.530 --> 01:23:59.363
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think that there's always this</v>
<v Speaker 4>tendency in human beings that long from </v>

1596
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:06.980
<v Speaker 4>front Ostalgie they look back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>past to a moment when things made sense.</v>

1597
01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.233
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that there's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even when people are full of shit </v>

1598
01:24:09.951 --> 01:24:11.960
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they look back in high school days,</v>

1599
01:24:11.961 --> 01:24:13.070
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those were the good old days.</v>

1600
01:24:13.071 --> 01:24:14.990
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you talking about yet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pimples,</v>

1601
01:24:14.991 --> 01:24:16.760
<v Speaker 4>you were out of your fucking mind and </v>
<v Speaker 4>secure.</v>

1602
01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:19.340
<v Speaker 4>You're terrified of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't the good old days.</v>

1603
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.461
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Trump make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1605
01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:25.830
<v Speaker 1>bring back slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find some more.</v>

1606
01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Until we run out of Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murder The let's,</v>

1607
01:24:29.410 --> 01:24:32.500
<v Speaker 4>let's go to the Arab nations or let's go</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in the Amazon.</v>

1608
01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:32.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

1609
01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.240
<v Speaker 1>let's import them and murder and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring back all of that stuff.</v>

1610
01:24:36.241 --> 01:24:37.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never great.</v>

1611
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:39.630
<v Speaker 1>But as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

1612
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.160
<v Speaker 1>there is a kind of,</v>

1613
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:44.323
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm more optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's an awakening going on </v>

1614
01:24:46.221 --> 01:24:47.054
<v Speaker 4>right now with human beings that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>unprecedented and I think it's because </v>

1615
01:24:49.611 --> 01:24:50.444
<v Speaker 4>of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think because of the fact that we're </v>

1616
01:24:52.341 --> 01:24:53.174
<v Speaker 4>combining our thoughts and some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a strange way and sharing ideas and </v>

1617
01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.370
<v Speaker 4>information in a way that no one's ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>been able to do before.</v>

1618
01:24:58.940 --> 01:24:59.773
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people who've ever been </v>

1619
01:25:00.711 --> 01:25:04.250
<v Speaker 4>this aware of how crazy things are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1620
01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.113
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time it's lifted the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lunacy of last night's presidential </v>

1621
01:25:07.761 --> 01:25:11.030
<v Speaker 4>debate and you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I guess we really haven't,</v>

1622
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:12.103
<v Speaker 4>I mean we might be aware of things but </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual progress and not really being </v>

1623
01:25:14.481 --> 01:25:15.314
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

1624
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.233
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the ability to be aware of </v>

1625
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:18.850
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1626
01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:19.683
<v Speaker 1>But we are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not at least in sufficient </v>

1627
01:25:22.361 --> 01:25:23.194
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

1628
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1629
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Doing anything like we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not doing anything about it.</v>

1630
01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's the crux of the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing.</v>

1631
01:25:30.321 --> 01:25:31.154
<v Speaker 1>This is why intellectual spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual mysticism is a total waste </v>

1632
01:25:36.981 --> 01:25:38.480
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the,</v>

1633
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:40.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like intellectual violin playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1634
01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:44.030
<v Speaker 1>he got to play the violin or it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

1635
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.871
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1636
01:25:44.871 --> 01:25:48.710
<v Speaker 1>so thinking about Egypt is not great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability,</v>

1637
01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:49.700
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1638
01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.950
<v Speaker 1>The ability to</v>

1639
01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:53.670
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1640
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:54.503
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get information is now absolutely </v>

1641
01:25:56.771 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 1>unparalleled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:25:57.821 --> 01:25:58.420
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1643
01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.253
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been anything remotely </v>

1644
01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:03.230
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the same time there's never been that</v>

1645
01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:04.064
<v Speaker 1>much static.</v>

1646
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.080
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey we were talking about earlier the,</v>

1647
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:07.933
<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crystals sniffers in the Unicorns </v>

1648
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 3>and the ancient aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1649
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:14.503
<v Speaker 3>this is all a vast amount of static.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be able to find a way </v>

1650
01:26:18.021 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 3>that you have to find your way through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the static to the music.</v>

1651
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>How much is ancient aliens frustrated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:25.083
<v Speaker 3>Cause as much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I know I watched a couple of </v>

1653
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:27.224
<v Speaker 3>programs did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's throwing things at the TV and I </v>

1654
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 3>have low expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's TV.</v>

1655
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:34.694
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's entertainment than the people who </v>

1656
01:26:36.381 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>are putting it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1657
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:40.910
<v Speaker 3>don't know what they're doing except </v>
<v Speaker 3>they see that it works.</v>

1658
01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Then they want to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that he</v>

1659
01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.950
<v Speaker 4>aliens made the Pyramids?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to have all these experts.</v>

1660
01:26:47.951 --> 01:26:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Everything in is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it possible?</v>

1661
01:26:49.691 --> 01:26:52.750
<v Speaker 4>That extra terrestrials I guess that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

1662
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:53.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Through I will.</v>

1663
01:26:53.371 --> 01:26:54.204
<v Speaker 3>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Georgia of course pushed into a </v>

1664
01:26:56.071 --> 01:26:58.890
<v Speaker 3>corner says yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this and that and so on.</v>

1665
01:26:59.550 --> 01:27:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Still it's aliens.</v>

1666
01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So close.</v>

1667
01:27:01.601 --> 01:27:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1668
01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.670
<v Speaker 4>he's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that guy.</v>

1669
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.590
<v Speaker 4>He's a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a funny guy.</v>

1670
01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.633
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>w when you think of ancient Egypt and </v>

1671
01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:11.530
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think of the,</v>

1672
01:27:11.531 --> 01:27:14.470
<v Speaker 4>the public's understanding and awareness</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it,</v>

1673
01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.380
<v Speaker 4>what do you think the average person is </v>
<v Speaker 4>missing?</v>

1674
01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.400
<v Speaker 3>All of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of it,</v>

1675
01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.050
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.273
<v Speaker 4>So you think it's like right before our </v>
<v Speaker 4>fate in front of our eyes and most </v>

1677
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 4>people just have no idea the majesty and</v>
<v Speaker 4>how intensely unique it is.</v>

1678
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.961
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1679
01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:32.420
<v Speaker 3>our mystery of the Spanx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which at that time,</v>

1680
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 3>one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most watched TV documentaries</v>

1681
01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:37.364
<v Speaker 3>of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really had a massive audience and </v>

1682
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:41.840
<v Speaker 3>people who saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember it?</v>

1683
01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even to this day,</v>

1684
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:45.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw it.</v>

1685
01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did?</v>

1686
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.353
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a vhs cassette tape of it serve </v>

1687
01:27:49.071 --> 01:27:51.320
<v Speaker 3>really late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought it.</v>

1688
01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did I bring it?</v>

1689
01:27:52.230 --> 01:27:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I'd forget if I brought you the way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna get it online now.</v>

1690
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.103
<v Speaker 3>Might be on youth on DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to bring you a DVD of it </v>

1691
01:27:58.251 --> 01:27:59.084
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've maybe for kind of almost </v>

1692
01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 3>memorized it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1693
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:02.294
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen anyway quite a few times </v>

1694
01:28:03.261 --> 01:28:08.060
<v Speaker 3>that had a certain impact for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if 30 million people saw it,</v>

1695
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:11.990
<v Speaker 3>300 minutes didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1696
01:28:12.170 --> 01:28:13.003
<v Speaker 3>And then going there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really what's up and well that's </v>

1697
01:28:15.321 --> 01:28:16.920
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that's the big crunch.</v>

1698
01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:19.730
<v Speaker 3>And that only x number of people can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1699
01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:22.000
<v Speaker 4>I went to the Vatican last summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 4>This past summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1701
01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:25.200
<v Speaker 4>my first time ever in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1702
01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.720
<v Speaker 4>I had seen it on television before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I'd seen videos and stuff.</v>

1703
01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I've seen photos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

1704
01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:33.280
<v Speaker 4>when you're there and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1705
01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.230
<v Speaker 4>what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>St Peter's Basilica.</v>

1706
01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:36.820
<v Speaker 4>St Paul's.</v>

1707
01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Saint Paul's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1708
01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Paul's St Paul's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

1709
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:40.803
<v Speaker 3>one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now Miss [inaudible] at Saint </v>

1710
01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Peter's is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is with the Dome,</v>

1711
01:28:45.551 --> 01:28:46.690
<v Speaker 3>with a Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes out.</v>

1712
01:28:46.691 --> 01:28:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1713
01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:47.643
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at it and you go when you're </v>

1714
01:28:49.061 --> 01:28:52.810
<v Speaker 4>inside of it and you realize the insane </v>
<v Speaker 4>magnitude of the construction,</v>

1715
01:28:52.811 --> 01:28:53.644
<v Speaker 4>the fact that it took hundreds of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>to complete and they did it all without </v>

1716
01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:57.850
<v Speaker 4>sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without power tools,</v>

1717
01:28:57.851 --> 01:28:58.684
<v Speaker 4>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did it all without any modern </v>

1718
01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:05.251
<v Speaker 4>equipment and unbelievably beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible work of art.</v>

1719
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 4>And it pales in comparison to what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>did in Egypt.</v>

1720
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:09.090
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

1721
01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.440
<v Speaker 4>Which is like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain,</v>

1722
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:13.810
<v Speaker 4>I think I got to go because it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1723
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also have an obelisk that's a 4,000</v>

1724
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 4>year old ambulance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said a little major.</v>

1725
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:19.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stole it from me.</v>

1726
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.553
<v Speaker 4>And you just look at that and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're there physically and you look at </v>

1727
01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 4>it in person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go,</v>

1728
01:29:23.890 --> 01:29:26.160
<v Speaker 4>how long fuck did they make this?</v>

1729
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute now wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1730
01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:29.053
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cathedral is the silica is very </v>

1731
01:29:31.201 --> 01:29:34.050
<v Speaker 1>interesting and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how did they move?</v>

1732
01:29:34.051 --> 01:29:34.884
<v Speaker 1>How did they get this actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting book by my now deceased </v>

1733
01:29:38.101 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 1>friend Peter Tompkins on the magic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the obelisks where he's talking about,</v>

1734
01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping that out of there.</v>

1735
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Out of context and bringing him to Rome </v>
<v Speaker 1>and New York and New England,</v>

1736
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:48.893
<v Speaker 1>and it was interesting because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought over in the 19th century and </v>

1737
01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:52.554
<v Speaker 1>it's already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1738
01:29:52.650 --> 01:29:53.483
<v Speaker 1>technology's pretty advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean was huge cranes and all the rest </v>

1739
01:29:56.401 --> 01:30:01.401
<v Speaker 1>of it and it strained the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Victorian technology to the utmost.</v>

1740
01:30:02.071 --> 01:30:02.904
<v Speaker 1>They get these things over and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that the Egyptians did it with </v>

1741
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:12.141
<v Speaker 1>none of those tools that all they </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow got ripped out of the bedrock,</v>

1742
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.823
<v Speaker 1>brought down the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken offloaded from the raft or boats </v>

1743
01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a big job transported across</v>

1744
01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:22.014
<v Speaker 1>the ground that's doable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>erected in place precisely to the </v>

1745
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 1>millimeter millimeter on the base.</v>

1746
01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:32.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have levels.</v>

1747
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:36.300
<v Speaker 1>What did they have levels like bubble </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels and not bubbled levels,</v>

1748
01:30:36.301 --> 01:30:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but they had other kinds of did it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>water somehow or another that that's,</v>

1749
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that's I think reasonably well </v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

1750
01:30:44.191 --> 01:30:46.560
<v Speaker 1>but I forget exactly how it was on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they leveled.</v>

1751
01:30:46.561 --> 01:30:47.394
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the base of the pyramid to the </v>

1752
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:50.034
<v Speaker 1>millimeter or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything that you look at in </v>

1753
01:30:54.451 --> 01:30:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go there,</v>

1754
01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.093
<v Speaker 1>the deeper you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more mysterious it becomes and new </v>

1755
01:30:59.691 --> 01:31:01.370
<v Speaker 1>marvel at on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The devil did this.</v>

1756
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:02.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king's chamber is one of the most </v>

1757
01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:07.170
<v Speaker 1>bizarre ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no buzz up.</v>

1758
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:09.600
<v Speaker 1>More bizarre than than other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>

1759
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:12.080
<v Speaker 4>but just the enormity of the stones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way theirs,</v>

1760
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:16.720
<v Speaker 4>they're set up that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a complex system.</v>

1761
01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:19.050
<v Speaker 4>The way that the way they've set them in</v>
<v Speaker 4>place is so cool.</v>

1762
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the ones that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called relieving chambers,</v>

1763
01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.590
<v Speaker 1>which are really resonating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chambers,</v>

1764
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.290
<v Speaker 1>resonating chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1765
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.340
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing I think.</v>

1766
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:30.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not that.</v>

1767
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:31.583
<v Speaker 1>They don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't relieve anything </v>

1768
01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:33.733
<v Speaker 1>architectural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He completely unnecessary to relieve </v>

1769
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:37.043
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stresses from above directly below </v>

1770
01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:41.970
<v Speaker 1>the king chamber is the so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Queen's chamber,</v>

1771
01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:43.283
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't have that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a simple gabled roof and that </v>

1772
01:31:45.451 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 1>protects it from anything that it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other Chambers,</v>

1773
01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.230
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the king chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like being,</v>

1774
01:31:52.231 --> 01:31:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it's an echo chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1775
01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:55.083
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a miraculous place and of </v>

1776
01:31:56.851 --> 01:31:59.070
<v Speaker 1>course everything is precision cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

1777
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't look that fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>insistent and it's the,</v>

1778
01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:03.503
<v Speaker 1>the level above that are the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing things because these are the 70 </v>

1779
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:07.234
<v Speaker 1>ton blocks of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where you're talking </v>

1780
01:32:08.561 --> 01:32:10.630
<v Speaker 1>about how they got those into place.</v>

1781
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:11.463
<v Speaker 1>No one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're responsible for the </v>

1782
01:32:13.781 --> 01:32:17.020
<v Speaker 1>resonance of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that particular chamber.</v>

1783
01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:17.854
<v Speaker 1>And it's my belief that resonance plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>even not necessarily resonance with the </v>

1784
01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 1>human voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in there,</v>

1785
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:27.543
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the acoustic term feedback or </v>

1786
01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 1>whatever that you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1787
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.080
<v Speaker 1>if we're in the king's chamber and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1788
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:35.914
<v Speaker 1>we rent the pyramid for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours in for a meditation session and </v>

1789
01:32:39.041 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 1>not on my trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're in there,</v>

1790
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:43.083
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a conversation the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having it now you have to talk </v>

1791
01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise the reverberation is such that</v>

1792
01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it's grumbled your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1793
01:32:52.641 --> 01:32:55.810
<v Speaker 1>if this can only be deliberate and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can hear from the,</v>

1794
01:32:57.130 --> 01:32:57.963
<v Speaker 1>you can hear from the king's chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do set up and you do a chant in </v>

1795
01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:02.284
<v Speaker 1>the king's chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go all the way down the ground </v>

1796
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:08.020
<v Speaker 1>gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a place below where you</v>

1797
01:33:08.021 --> 01:33:08.890
<v Speaker 1>have to make a turn.</v>

1798
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:09.723
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a descending passage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes as deep below the ground as </v>

1799
01:33:13.571 --> 01:33:14.404
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the pyramid has this king's chamber </v>

1800
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:20.890
<v Speaker 1>is above the ground is about 12 story </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaft that you go out on the ground,</v>

1801
01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:21.724
<v Speaker 1>12 stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 stories down below and then 12 </v>

1802
01:33:23.291 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 1>stories built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1803
01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll write a very good and um,</v>

1804
01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1805
01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:35.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you set up a chance in the,</v>

1806
01:33:35.011 --> 01:33:38.800
<v Speaker 1>in the king's chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear it down in the,</v>

1807
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:41.740
<v Speaker 1>in the pit below 12 stores below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1808
01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:45.220
<v Speaker 1>But you shouldn't be able to hear it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all because the sound has to go down and</v>

1809
01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:47.530
<v Speaker 1>then turn around and then go down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other shop.</v>

1810
01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.850
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

1811
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.800
<v Speaker 1>because people are always asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1812
01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:52.083
<v Speaker 1>it's a function of age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long are you going to keep doing </v>

1813
01:33:54.191 --> 01:33:57.880
<v Speaker 1>these traps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

1814
01:33:57.881 --> 01:33:58.714
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1815
01:33:58.930 --> 01:34:01.060
<v Speaker 1>unless and until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1816
01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't get up and down the king time up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the king's chamber,</v>

1817
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.943
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be doing trips unless some media </v>

1818
01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 1>thing takes over.</v>

1819
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:10.900
<v Speaker 1>But they say in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can do it,</v>

1820
01:34:10.901 --> 01:34:13.900
<v Speaker 1>it ain't bragging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good line.</v>

1821
01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 1>So I was in Egypt reasonably on my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the research reckie trip,</v>

1822
01:34:18.851 --> 01:34:20.950
<v Speaker 1>but that may lead to something and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>May not,</v>

1823
01:34:20.951 --> 01:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll say keep trip or record </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconnaissance.</v>

1824
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film Lingo for reconnaissance.</v>

1825
01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1826
01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.870
<v Speaker 1>not regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not reiki now and,</v>

1827
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.950
<v Speaker 1>and actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so normally you have a go with the group</v>

1828
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:38.650
<v Speaker 1>up to the king's chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't bother to go.</v>

1829
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.903
<v Speaker 1>We open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets opened up and he'd go down into </v>

1830
01:34:41.321 --> 01:34:42.180
<v Speaker 1>the pet side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said Nah,</v>

1831
01:34:42.650 --> 01:34:43.483
<v Speaker 1>cause my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my 84th birthday I happened to be in </v>

1832
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:46.211
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

1833
01:34:46.211 --> 01:34:48.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll test it.</v>

1834
01:34:48.251 --> 01:34:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So I went up to the king's chamber and </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the shaft,</v>

1835
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 1>that's 12 stories up on 12 stories down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went down to the pit.</v>

1836
01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:55.883
<v Speaker 1>It was 12 stories down and 12 stories up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I figured that was pretty good for </v>

1837
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.520
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was pretty good.</v>

1838
01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll be doing the trips for a while.</v>

1839
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good because I mean,</v>

1840
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:08.654
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's capable of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of experience that you </v>

1841
01:35:12.231 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 1>would provide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your knowledge of Egypt is,</v>

1842
01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty rare in this day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1843
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping when I had this idea to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude my own trips,</v>

1844
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:21.644
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh finally I'll make a living out of </v>

1845
01:35:22.611 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was that no sooner had</v>

1846
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:28.160
<v Speaker 1>my guidebook come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't have a copy of that,</v>

1847
01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:30.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's out of print now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have copies,</v>

1848
01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:33.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

1849
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:39.290
<v Speaker 1>back in [inaudible] 85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of the terrorist things happen</v>

1850
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:40.124
<v Speaker 1>then these guys hijack the cruise ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>off Alexandria and push this poor old </v>

1851
01:35:46.131 --> 01:35:50.600
<v Speaker 1>guy in a wheelchair over the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd of the cruise ship and he drowned.</v>

1852
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And that my book had just come out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly the tourist trade was killed.</v>

1853
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It's talking about people being afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a whole year.</v>

1854
01:35:58.911 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It took for it to develop and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did develop again,</v>

1855
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.210
<v Speaker 1>but the book had disappeared from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelves by that time anyway.</v>

1856
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Was still available of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1857
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:10.490
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my thread.</v>

1858
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the trips.</v>

1859
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you say with Egypt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone doing what?</v>

1860
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:19.183
<v Speaker 1>Someone doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My plan was I wanted to train a number </v>

1861
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:25.040
<v Speaker 1>of people up to who cook familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1862
01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:29.330
<v Speaker 1>steeped and symbol as Egypt to to spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word as it were.</v>

1863
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:31.090
<v Speaker 1>And while I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was added,</v>

1864
01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:33.860
<v Speaker 1>get a commission from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the trips to,</v>

1865
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:34.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide some useful wolf repellent so </v>

1866
01:36:37.131 --> 01:36:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you can have some nice passive income </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

1867
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it never happened because you know,</v>

1868
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:46.790
<v Speaker 1>one thing led to another and it was hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough getting my own trips filled up.</v>

1869
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.800
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the PR,</v>

1870
01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately as it now stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one,</v>

1871
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.233
<v Speaker 1>only a handful of people know symbolist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt well enough to communicate it as </v>

1872
01:36:57.621 --> 01:37:00.340
<v Speaker 1>it just so happens I'm the only one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>does trips out.</v>

1873
01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.553
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really am the only wheel in town in </v>

1874
01:37:02.991 --> 01:37:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1875
01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you brought us a bunch of slides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once you tell me what,</v>

1876
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.050
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to show us and what did</v>

1877
01:37:09.051 --> 01:37:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you bring here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1878
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my whole long lecture.</v>

1879
01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:17.270
<v Speaker 1>You want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go to the,</v>

1880
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 1>to the geology of the Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water weathering.</v>

1881
01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other slides,</v>

1882
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to that,</v>

1883
01:37:26.991 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 1>the gigantic blocks paving blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1884
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:32.420
<v Speaker 1>around particularly around the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

1885
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:37.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm fucking pyramid and yeah,</v>

1886
01:37:39.141 --> 01:37:39.974
<v Speaker 1>mostly around the second pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I mean all of that stuff </v>

1887
01:37:44.241 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 1>relates to the scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the geological evidence.</v>

1888
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Then I wanted to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to touch the,</v>

1889
01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 1>the symbolist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quest for immortality cause that's a</v>

1890
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:57.744
<v Speaker 1>total big subsequent thing I did want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into and we didn't even talk about </v>

1891
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1892
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1893
01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:09.411
<v Speaker 1>the map of the map of Dumbfuckistan and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I call the,</v>

1894
01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've got a great graphic for it.</v>

1895
01:38:12.571 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 1>And actually the everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1896
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:18.600
<v Speaker 1>certainly and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably most of your audience will know</v>

1897
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 1>about the four horsemen of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse,</v>

1898
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:22.043
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From revelation who are actually </v>

1899
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:29.061
<v Speaker 1>interesting study in its own right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The four horsemen are war,</v>

1900
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 1>famine and war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>

1901
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:36.870
<v Speaker 1>pestilence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and death.</v>

1902
01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.273
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting about the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>horsemen is that only war is really </v>

1903
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:43.500
<v Speaker 1>under human control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in theory,</v>

1904
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>the famine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pestilence,</v>

1905
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.360
<v Speaker 1>plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>

1906
01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:49.643
<v Speaker 1>and death comes to us all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a peculiar choice actually for the </v>

1907
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:53.034
<v Speaker 1>four horsemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I invented the five cowboys of </v>

1908
01:38:56.761 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse 2.0</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are,</v>

1909
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.650
<v Speaker 1>and they are capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotism,</v>

1910
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and entertainment.</v>

1911
01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.300
<v Speaker 6>All this stuff I love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:14.980
<v Speaker 6>Well that's the end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1913
01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.353
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just another way of looking at </v>

1914
01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:21.400
<v Speaker 6>things actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's really human folly.</v>

1915
01:39:21.490 --> 01:39:22.210
<v Speaker 6>All of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1916
01:39:22.210 --> 01:39:22.810
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1917
01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:25.150
<v Speaker 6>call it democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Call it capitalism,</v>

1918
01:39:25.151 --> 01:39:26.960
<v Speaker 6>call it technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1919
01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:29.290
<v Speaker 6>it's none of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's human folly.</v>

1920
01:39:29.291 --> 01:39:32.770
<v Speaker 6>It's the human,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the error and human use that,</v>

1921
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:33.420
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1922
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:34.253
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1923
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.513
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism is really based upon the </v>

1924
01:39:38.521 --> 01:39:40.260
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything for me,</v>

1925
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:41.183
<v Speaker 1>nothing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see everybody's fighting for market </v>

1926
01:39:43.381 --> 01:39:44.700
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you live with a guide?</v>

1927
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

1928
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.070
<v Speaker 6>that's competition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if it wasn't for that competition,</v>

1929
01:39:49.071 --> 01:39:49.904
<v Speaker 6>we wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It shoot across the sky wouldn't have </v>

1930
01:39:52.731 --> 01:39:56.300
<v Speaker 6>laptops at work so well we might have </v>
<v Speaker 6>internet that's so fast.</v>

1931
01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't know and we might,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we might not.</v>

1932
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:59.623
<v Speaker 6>It's very possible that we wouldn't and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a downside to all of those </v>

1933
01:40:02.001 --> 01:40:03.560
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the mat upside too.</v>

1934
01:40:03.561 --> 01:40:05.780
<v Speaker 6>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a glass half full kind of guy.</v>

1935
01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.720
<v Speaker 6>That to me was that's the technology </v>
<v Speaker 6>side of it and got to that yet totalism</v>

1936
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.570
<v Speaker 1>is based upon everything for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing for you.</v>

1937
01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Patriotism is based upon everything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1938
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:18.183
<v Speaker 1>Nothing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bumper sticker says God bless </v>

1939
01:40:20.591 --> 01:40:21.424
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hidden sticky sides as in fuck </v>

1940
01:40:23.771 --> 01:40:25.070
<v Speaker 1>everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1941
01:40:25.130 --> 01:40:25.963
<v Speaker 1>That's patriotism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democracy is that the idea is that the </v>

1942
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:34.570
<v Speaker 1>dishwashers elect the chef and tell them</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>

1943
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:35.703
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat in the restaurant with the </v>

1944
01:40:37.150 --> 01:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>dishwashers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elect the chef and tell him what to do.</v>

1945
01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.390
<v Speaker 1>It's flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hopelessly flawed to begin with,</v>

1946
01:40:43.391 --> 01:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>which Plato recognized perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill said,</v>

1947
01:40:47.561 --> 01:40:48.394
<v Speaker 1>deb malick cracy looks like the worst of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all possible of all possible political </v>

1948
01:40:51.881 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 1>systems until look at all the others</v>

1949
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:55.383
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is fun and it's not necessarily </v>

1950
01:40:57.761 --> 01:40:58.960
<v Speaker 3>untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same time.</v>

1951
01:40:58.961 --> 01:40:59.794
<v Speaker 3>He also said contradicting himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best argument against democracy is </v>

1952
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:05.710
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes of conversation with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>average voter.</v>

1953
01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:07.333
<v Speaker 3>I know about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my leaders elected </v>

1954
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:14.770
<v Speaker 3>numerically ply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The average voter actually,</v>

1955
01:41:14.771 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>if they had a test for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there were,</v>

1956
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.150
<v Speaker 3>if there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there were,</v>

1957
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:22.820
<v Speaker 3>which is next to impossible to even </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceive if it,</v>

1958
01:41:22.890 --> 01:41:25.010
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if voting we're a privilege.</v>

1959
01:41:25.011 --> 01:41:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean when the country started off it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a privilege,</v>

1960
01:41:27.671 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 3>but you had to be a white male who owned</v>
<v Speaker 3>property,</v>

1961
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.293
<v Speaker 3>which is not as elitist as it actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks now because in those days they </v>

1962
01:41:38.021 --> 01:41:38.854
<v Speaker 3>were the only ones who were substantial </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough and probably had some sort of an </v>

1963
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:42.394
<v Speaker 3>education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean necessarily that they </v>

1964
01:41:43.571 --> 01:41:47.540
<v Speaker 3>understand the principles and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1965
01:41:47.541 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were the s you might say this solid</v>

1966
01:41:49.991 --> 01:41:52.690
<v Speaker 3>citizens who at least could read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1967
01:41:52.691 --> 01:41:55.900
<v Speaker 3>nobody else could read except people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an education of some sorts.</v>

1968
01:41:56.230 --> 01:41:57.063
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the rule and it wasn't a </v>

1969
01:41:58.841 --> 01:41:59.674
<v Speaker 3>terribly good rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might have been in its own way </v>

1970
01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:03.603
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's as a principle that it shouldn't </v>

1971
01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:11.390
<v Speaker 3>be a privilege to vote just as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody could produce pr.</v>

1972
01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't anybody be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain surgery,</v>

1973
01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or design engineer design a bridge.</v>

1974
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm as good as the next guy but I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>never designed to bridge.</v>

1975
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:24.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a democracy.</v>

1976
01:42:24.731 --> 01:42:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or play center field for the mets that I</v>

1977
01:42:29.101 --> 01:42:33.130
<v Speaker 3>would just really essentially anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to say,</v>

1978
01:42:33.131 --> 01:42:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>step up.</v>

1979
01:42:34.811 --> 01:42:36.700
<v Speaker 3>This is my plan and get people to vote </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

1980
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Well that it's a catastrophe anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it this way and its current form and</v>

1981
01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:43.870
<v Speaker 3>in fact as far back as he could go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

1982
01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:45.280
<v Speaker 3>it's been a disaster.</v>

1983
01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Democracy technology is certainly a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixed bag.</v>

1984
01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.820
<v Speaker 3>The problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two big problems with technology.</v>

1985
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:55.960
<v Speaker 3>The main one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we touched upon this earlier,</v>

1986
01:42:56.650 --> 01:42:57.483
<v Speaker 3>is that technology deprives the average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the normal human being of making a </v>

1987
01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:07.330
<v Speaker 3>living out of his own product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of his own creativity.</v>

1988
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It deprives them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technology does it.</v>

1989
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:11.613
<v Speaker 3>The only people who are creative in </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology are the people who are </v>

1990
01:43:14.411 --> 01:43:18.610
<v Speaker 3>creating the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else serves the technology.</v>

1991
01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.520
<v Speaker 3>They work in the offices that serve the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

1992
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:22.743
<v Speaker 3>They they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're basically slaves to the </v>

1993
01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:25.864
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the people that use the </v>

1994
01:43:26.651 --> 01:43:30.640
<v Speaker 3>technology to separate themselves from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from slave jobs?</v>

1995
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>started their own businesses online.</v>

1996
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they could use technology now,</v>

1997
01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.320
<v Speaker 3>so you can crafts people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create things.</v>

1998
01:43:38.321 --> 01:43:39.154
<v Speaker 3>That's the upside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a relatively small part </v>

1999
01:43:41.651 --> 01:43:44.590
<v Speaker 3>compared to the number of people they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>

2000
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:47.980
<v Speaker 3>They talk about all these good jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>going at the China.</v>

2001
01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 3>That was a shitty jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody in their right mind would to work</v>

2002
01:43:51.501 --> 01:43:52.200
<v Speaker 3>in a factory.</v>

2003
01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.800
<v Speaker 1>If you ever worked in a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2004
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Or been in the factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2005
01:43:55.810 --> 01:43:56.643
<v Speaker 1>I've been in factories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to schools is seldom as I </v>

2006
01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>possibly could in Bethlehem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania,</v>

2007
01:44:01.461 --> 01:44:02.750
<v Speaker 1>which is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2008
01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bethlehem steel center was.</v>

2009
01:44:05.501 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And we used to go there on field drops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Mackerel.</v>

2010
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:09.344
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was like working in Dante's </v>

2011
01:44:10.341 --> 01:44:11.174
<v Speaker 1>inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these black and figured jumping up and </v>

2012
01:44:13.281 --> 01:44:14.114
<v Speaker 1>down in the blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heat of the bessemer converters and </v>

2013
01:44:17.721 --> 01:44:18.554
<v Speaker 1>the other kinds of jobs of robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffing things into boxes of flipping </v>

2014
01:44:22.941 --> 01:44:26.330
<v Speaker 1>burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of people,</v>

2015
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the,</v>

2016
01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:29.660
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 1>they have the television sets and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and stuff like that.</v>

2018
01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.453
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority of people cannot </v>

2019
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 1>do not and cannot make their living out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their own creativity.</v>

2020
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however terrible things may have been in</v>

2021
01:44:41.931 --> 01:44:42.764
<v Speaker 1>medieval times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people did creative transformational </v>

2022
01:44:45.411 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2023
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the downside of technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other bad side of technology,</v>

2024
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you talked about the good side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad side is that it's,</v>

2025
01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not immoral necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's amoral.</v>

2026
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:01.130
<v Speaker 1>So as long as they can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it.</v>

2027
01:45:01.530 --> 01:45:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within my budget.</v>

2028
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen bomb,</v>

2029
01:45:04.701 --> 01:45:05.990
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't invent it.</v>

2030
01:45:05.991 --> 01:45:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nerve gas.</v>

2031
01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a very good way of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>wet roadway with,</v>

2032
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around stuff,</v>

2033
01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 1>strike toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a waste of time and effort and</v>

2034
01:45:14.871 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we can sell more,</v>

2035
01:45:16.881 --> 01:45:17.714
<v Speaker 1>strike two strike toothpaste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then unstrapped toothpaste and the rest </v>

2036
01:45:21.261 --> 01:45:22.760
<v Speaker 1>of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

2037
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:24.770
<v Speaker 1>a percentage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2038
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:25.663
<v Speaker 1>the medicine is very good until it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the hands of big Pharma that makes </v>

2039
01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:31.990
<v Speaker 1>sure that the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>

2040
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:32.833
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are ripped off for her to </v>

2041
01:45:35.691 --> 01:45:38.270
<v Speaker 1>get at the medicine that they need in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the medicine that they,</v>

2042
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.170
<v Speaker 1>that they have available is not usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cure.</v>

2043
01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:45.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of keeping people alive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying more medicine.</v>

2044
01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's actually a cure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from alternative sources is fought</v>

2045
01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:53.060
<v Speaker 1>to the death by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the big pharmaceutical companies.</v>

2046
01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:57.800
<v Speaker 1>So technology is certainly a mixed bag </v>
<v Speaker 1>and entertainment,</v>

2047
01:45:57.910 --> 01:46:00.810
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you define it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what,</v>

2048
01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:03.590
<v Speaker 1>what you do to kill time before it kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2049
01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:05.420
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a waste of,</v>

2050
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's takes your mind off the,</v>

2051
01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.340
<v Speaker 1>of the boringness of your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2052
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:16.820
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different art is not entertainment.</v>

2053
01:46:16.821 --> 01:46:17.654
<v Speaker 1>There's a broad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a broad line in between that at </v>

2054
01:46:21.321 --> 01:46:25.340
<v Speaker 1>least in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could or should be filled by comedy,</v>

2055
01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.593
<v Speaker 1>which is not exactly entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly sacred science </v>

2056
01:46:30.831 --> 01:46:34.550
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it plays at least theoretically it,</v>

2057
01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can play a kind of a transformational</v>

2058
01:46:38.451 --> 01:46:39.860
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

2059
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:45.700
<v Speaker 1>real high level comedy is enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2060
01:46:46.431 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it points out and comedy is based upon,</v>

2061
01:46:49.951 --> 01:46:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only,</v>

2062
01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:56.811
<v Speaker 1>comedy is based upon what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't laugh at what's right.</v>

2063
01:46:59.060 --> 01:46:59.893
<v Speaker 1>You can't make fun of good sex or good </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and you can make fun of attitudes </v>

2064
01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:05.880
<v Speaker 1>toward good sex or good food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't laugh.</v>

2065
01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>That's at what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Easily,</v>

2066
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 1>but you can laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do laugh at what's wrong.</v>

2067
01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say at some inner level by </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing at what's wrong</v>

2068
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:25.400
<v Speaker 1>inadvertently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a recognition we have within us,</v>

2069
01:47:25.401 --> 01:47:27.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2070
01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.400
<v Speaker 1>we have a moral,</v>

2071
01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:29.700
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2072
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:34.700
<v Speaker 1>compass by the wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a moral thermometer or something</v>

2073
01:47:35.371 --> 01:47:36.204
<v Speaker 1>of the sort that recognizes by </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing what's wrong were assenting </v>

2074
01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 1>we're giving asset to what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is too cultural.</v>

2075
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:44.334
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's funny to an Eskimo is not </v>

2076
01:47:45.421 --> 01:47:46.254
<v Speaker 1>necessarily funny to an African,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 22 an African is not necessarily </v>

2077
01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 1>funny to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2078
01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.950
<v Speaker 1>to a Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but comedy has this potential to play,</v>

2079
01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.770
<v Speaker 1>at least in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transformational role.</v>

2080
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:01.170
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly it doesn't,</v>

2081
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:02.063
<v Speaker 1>an entertainment at the American level </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on your television set is that </v>

2082
01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:08.580
<v Speaker 1>entertain and it's certainly not art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2083
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:10.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a deadening.</v>

2084
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:12.600
<v Speaker 1>It's an anodyne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2085
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it is,</v>

2086
01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.400
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

2087
01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

2088
01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:19.110
<v Speaker 1>is a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2089
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:21.650
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it take to go set it?</v>

2090
01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.633
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>

2091
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it's basically a kind of sedative or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite or,</v>

2092
01:48:26.401 --> 01:48:28.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a benny,</v>

2093
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:30.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a stimulant that it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stimulant,</v>

2094
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.903
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually with your opens the terminator </v>

2095
01:48:33.061 --> 01:48:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and all of that horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious things that they do.</v>

2096
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2097
01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's get to the slides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2098
01:48:39.650 --> 01:48:41.330
<v Speaker 3>It's cause we're already two hours in </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2099
01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:41.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2100
01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2101
01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:44.990
<v Speaker 3>let's take a look at some of the slides </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

2102
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:47.660
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to start?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's start with the geology start right</v>

2103
01:48:47.661 --> 01:48:50.030
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning and I'll just whip your</v>
<v Speaker 3>passed.</v>

2104
01:48:50.031 --> 01:48:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now why are they,</v>

2105
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:52.663
<v Speaker 3>this is a really confusing thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do they continue to rebuild that </v>

2106
01:48:56.631 --> 01:48:57.464
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when they're rebuilding it and </v>

2107
01:48:58.821 --> 01:49:02.030
<v Speaker 3>they're rebuilding the feet and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pause of the Sphinx,</v>

2108
01:49:02.031 --> 01:49:05.510
<v Speaker 3>and I understand there's considerable </v>
<v Speaker 3>erosion that that they have to mitigate,</v>

2109
01:49:05.511 --> 01:49:06.344
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the sphinx anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's bringing the swings back to </v>

2110
01:49:10.581 --> 01:49:11.414
<v Speaker 3>supposedly what it was originally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is really is an engineering </v>

2111
01:49:15.471 --> 01:49:16.304
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know themselves and at least </v>

2112
01:49:17.901 --> 01:49:19.820
<v Speaker 3>a few of them acknowledge it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shock,</v>

2113
01:49:19.821 --> 01:49:20.654
<v Speaker 3>thanks this number and he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not in charge of doing the repairs </v>

2114
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:24.643
<v Speaker 3>that it may be doing more damage because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still weathering on the inside and </v>

2115
01:49:28.221 --> 01:49:31.760
<v Speaker 3>like covering it over with these usually</v>
<v Speaker 3>very badly,</v>

2116
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:33.283
<v Speaker 3>badly done stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're actually doing more damage </v>

2117
01:49:35.721 --> 01:49:35.950
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

2118
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Antiquities,</v>

2119
01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.180
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're no longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's no longer in the bucky.</v>

2120
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Did they lock them up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2121
01:49:42.621 --> 01:49:43.011
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2122
01:49:43.011 --> 01:49:43.844
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in trouble.</v>

2123
01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in trouble,</v>

2124
01:49:46.341 --> 01:49:49.290
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could.</v>

2125
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2126
01:49:51.570 --> 01:49:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a personal level,</v>

2127
01:49:53.141 --> 01:49:55.900
<v Speaker 3>that's another long story when we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>already gone on for two hours,</v>

2128
01:49:55.901 --> 01:50:00.901
<v Speaker 3>but on a personal level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get on with Zady and a nine,</v>

2129
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:02.583
<v Speaker 3>he's now back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not formally in a position of power is </v>

2130
01:50:05.681 --> 01:50:09.640
<v Speaker 3>not headed the department and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's got his problems.</v>

2131
01:50:09.641 --> 01:50:11.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the debate that he had with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Graham Hancock?</v>

2132
01:50:11.401 --> 01:50:12.700
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2133
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:14.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was exactly there.</v>

2134
01:50:14.611 --> 01:50:16.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of his friends even,</v>

2135
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who runs my trip Mama dogs </v>

2136
01:50:19.190 --> 01:50:20.023
<v Speaker 3>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called the surgeon because he really </v>

2137
01:50:21.521 --> 01:50:26.470
<v Speaker 3>knows how to operate his wonderful guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a good personal friend of Zeiss</v>

2138
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:27.870
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2139
01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.410
<v Speaker 3>thought he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a disaster,</v>

2140
01:50:29.411 --> 01:50:30.730
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2141
01:50:30.731 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 3>he lived through it and he's back back </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the scene as it were.</v>

2142
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:35.703
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at this finks and closure </v>

2143
01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:40.060
<v Speaker 3>here and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this massive,</v>

2144
01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:43.840
<v Speaker 3>massive structure with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this erosion around it,</v>

2145
01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.733
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this road intuit and then they'll </v>

2146
01:50:45.641 --> 01:50:47.580
<v Speaker 3>send this on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2147
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:48.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

2148
01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.740
<v Speaker 3>when you'll see as we go through a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides,</v>

2149
01:50:50.741 --> 01:50:53.740
<v Speaker 3>you get a few slides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see the sense of that erosion.</v>

2150
01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:57.070
<v Speaker 3>This is just a wonderful picture of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken by a good friend of mine.</v>

2151
01:50:57.071 --> 01:50:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Keep going about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why,</v>

2152
01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:03.700
<v Speaker 3>this is why the swings could not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been weathered by sand.</v>

2153
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:06.040
<v Speaker 3>What we're looking at right now for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are just listening,</v>

2154
01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.860
<v Speaker 3>is it buried in sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it has been many,</v>

2155
01:51:08.861 --> 01:51:10.480
<v Speaker 3>many times when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2156
01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:13.030
<v Speaker 3>when Napoleon found that it was burdened</v>
<v Speaker 3>sand correct,</v>

2157
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.510
<v Speaker 3>completely buried in sand and probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a few thousand years,</v>

2158
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:17.703
<v Speaker 3>this is taken photograph taken about </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 when it had already been excavated </v>

2159
01:51:22.151 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 3>and filled up with sand again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happens pretty quickly.</v>

2160
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.193
<v Speaker 3>So basically you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a take a few hundred years that </v>

2161
01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 3>since it's supposed did construction </v>
<v Speaker 3>around 2,500</v>

2162
01:51:32.261 --> 01:51:33.094
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been buried in sand about 3000 of </v>

2163
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:38.110
<v Speaker 3>those 4,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2164
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:39.420
<v Speaker 3>That's the proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2165
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.293
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the evidence and still the </v>

2166
01:51:41.591 --> 01:51:42.424
<v Speaker 3>geologists go on ranting about sand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were talking about this friend </v>

2167
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:47.110
<v Speaker 3>of yours is going to cause a dreezy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2168
01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:48.250
<v Speaker 3>How did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did it,</v>

2169
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.350
<v Speaker 3>whether by sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wind and sand,</v>

2170
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wind can't get the wind,</v>

2171
01:51:52.901 --> 01:51:54.430
<v Speaker 3>can't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that that way,</v>

2172
01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:57.510
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that the original text of </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever who,</v>

2173
01:51:57.540 --> 01:51:59.710
<v Speaker 3>who do they attribute to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The construction of the pyramid?</v>

2174
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Moses?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2175
01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:00.900
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2176
01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:01.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2177
01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.133
<v Speaker 3>Pharaoh Khafra cops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This successor of Khufu who supposedly </v>

2178
01:52:05.381 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 3>built the Great Pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not true in its entirety,</v>

2179
01:52:10.450 --> 01:52:11.283
<v Speaker 3>the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is another comp com complex </v>

2180
01:52:13.301 --> 01:52:14.134
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you see everything's </v>

2181
01:52:15.041 --> 01:52:17.950
<v Speaker 3>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're almost certainly built in stages</v>

2182
01:52:17.951 --> 01:52:18.784
<v Speaker 3>in the earliest stages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably date from whenever the Sphinx </v>

2183
01:52:21.731 --> 01:52:25.240
<v Speaker 3>was originally built and the argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>for coffer building.</v>

2184
01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:29.460
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a tax that said that he had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream that if he uncovered this,</v>

2185
01:52:29.461 --> 01:52:31.720
<v Speaker 3>thinks that he would become pharaoh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2186
01:52:31.721 --> 01:52:33.910
<v Speaker 3>that's took Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's torn fat.</v>

2187
01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:34.803
<v Speaker 3>A thousand years later they attributed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to compro because the causeway that </v>

2188
01:52:40.451 --> 01:52:41.284
<v Speaker 3>leads from the spanx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you'd go to the behind it cause </v>

2189
01:52:43.561 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 3>either the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really as he just back into spanx.</v>

2190
01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:47.153
<v Speaker 3>The causeway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the causeway leads up to the right to </v>

2191
01:52:49.791 --> 01:52:53.320
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the PR of the Pyramid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the car for up pyramid,</v>

2192
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:54.163
<v Speaker 3>which he almost certainly did build or </v>
<v Speaker 3>any way super imposed upon something </v>

2193
01:52:57.861 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 3>that was there before because you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>prove that.</v>

2194
01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:00.973
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going to use the thing it was </v>

2195
01:53:01.761 --> 01:53:03.250
<v Speaker 3>taught Moses was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2196
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.651
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2197
01:53:03.651 --> 01:53:04.484
<v Speaker 3>They always thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always thought it was [inaudible] </v>

2198
01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:09.080
<v Speaker 3>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that again,</v>

2199
01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.970
<v Speaker 3>what is this right here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the Rosetta stone is no,</v>

2200
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.291
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2201
01:53:12.291 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2202
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:13.303
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the Stele of took Moses that </v>

2203
01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:19.670
<v Speaker 3>talks about how in a dream he ate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's covered with sand.</v>

2204
01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:21.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the end.</v>

2205
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:25.140
<v Speaker 3>1450 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as Abbott in 1450 BC,</v>

2206
01:53:25.141 --> 01:53:25.974
<v Speaker 3>it was confidence and exactly with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain number of other evidences of </v>

2207
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:30.254
<v Speaker 3>that sort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can put together the timeline that </v>

2208
01:53:32.061 --> 01:53:32.894
<v Speaker 3>tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear I've read online someone </v>

2209
01:53:34.401 --> 01:53:36.620
<v Speaker 3>attributed and Tut Moses to the creation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

2210
01:53:36.621 --> 01:53:38.880
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of junk.</v>

2211
01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Now the face of this finks and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really controversial thing,</v>

2212
01:53:42.411 --> 01:53:43.244
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the face of the Sphinx is </v>

2213
01:53:43.821 --> 01:53:44.654
<v Speaker 3>clearly newer than the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less eroded and it's also a very </v>

2214
01:53:47.691 --> 01:53:50.510
<v Speaker 3>African looking face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they think that,</v>

2215
01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:52.640
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously it's the continent </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>

2216
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:53.683
<v Speaker 3>but did they think there's the new beans</v>
<v Speaker 3>had conquered Egypt at one point in </v>

2217
01:53:56.211 --> 01:53:56.710
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2218
01:53:56.710 --> 01:54:00.110
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the speculation that one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the new being farrows had,</v>

2219
01:54:00.111 --> 01:54:01.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created this,</v>

2220
01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some said that 19th century travelers,</v>

2221
01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:08.660
<v Speaker 3>lots of them noted that this was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>an African face.</v>

2222
01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.610
<v Speaker 3>But what they meant is that it's a sub </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sahara Africa.</v>

2223
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:17.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a real African African face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new means a very black but have more</v>

2224
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:21.950
<v Speaker 3>or less find her features.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to draw like that.</v>

2225
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean that looks more like an NBA </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball player,</v>

2226
01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2227
01:54:27.670 --> 01:54:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Like the head dresses all re redone the </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture before with covered with sand.</v>

2228
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:37.180
<v Speaker 3>You see how they do read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom had bets in,</v>

2229
01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:42.240
<v Speaker 3>in its entirety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The face itself is a much harder outcrop</v>

2230
01:54:42.651 --> 01:54:43.484
<v Speaker 3>of limestone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it hasn't weathered to the same </v>

2231
01:54:46.161 --> 01:54:49.010
<v Speaker 3>extent that the body of the Sphinx has </v>
<v Speaker 3>weathered.</v>

2232
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:53.830
<v Speaker 3>So you think it's the same era?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know actually we of it,</v>

2233
01:54:53.850 --> 01:54:56.930
<v Speaker 3>you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the African face is a,</v>

2234
01:54:56.931 --> 01:54:59.960
<v Speaker 3>is a real problem actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course the Egyptians,</v>

2235
01:54:59.961 --> 01:55:00.794
<v Speaker 3>there was prejudice does everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't want to actually believe </v>

2236
01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:07.160
<v Speaker 3>that the Sphinx itself could be a sub </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saharan African.</v>

2237
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Maybe from an earlier period when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africans were pharaoh's we don't know.</v>

2238
01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:11.753
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't there some speculation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>initially it was an actual lion's face </v>

2239
01:55:14.691 --> 01:55:17.810
<v Speaker 3>and that the lion's face was cut down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create this,</v>

2240
01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:18.873
<v Speaker 3>that that's us speculating that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the head is way too small for </v>

2241
01:55:23.571 --> 01:55:24.404
<v Speaker 3>the body and it's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had the NYP D we did this big </v>

2242
01:55:28.431 --> 01:55:30.320
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the next slide coming up.</v>

2243
01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2244
01:55:31.941 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 3>there it is that you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Frank Domingo who was the,</v>

2245
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:36.913
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and why can't you taste well he was a </v>

2246
01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:44.090
<v Speaker 3>forensic senior forensic artist for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>NYP D is a guy who knows</v>

2247
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.450
<v Speaker 1>about physiology so young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2248
01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:51.360
<v Speaker 1>So he did a study of the comparative </v>
<v Speaker 1>phases of the swings.</v>

2249
01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.194
<v Speaker 1>And the of the strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one on the right and feral </v>

2250
01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.090
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his conclusion was that no artists,</v>

2251
01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:00.953
<v Speaker 1>no competent artist or sculptor who </v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly have used the same model </v>

2252
01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:08.910
<v Speaker 1>for the face of the spanx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for the cop rock face,</v>

2253
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:09.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professing there's a few Kopra faces </v>

2254
01:56:10.951 --> 01:56:12.960
<v Speaker 1>floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2255
01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.910
<v Speaker 1>my criminal partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when frank gave us that study,</v>

2256
01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2257
01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.370
<v Speaker 1>his comparative study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boris Saeed said,</v>

2258
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:23.580
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

2259
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:26.970
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the academic establishment,</v>

2260
01:56:26.971 --> 01:56:27.804
<v Speaker 1>this is bad news and worse news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad news is that there wasn't </v>

2261
01:56:30.901 --> 01:56:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Atlantis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the worst news is they were black.</v>

2262
01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:37.680
<v Speaker 1>My black friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that phrase.</v>

2263
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:40.020
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2264
01:56:40.021 --> 01:56:40.854
<v Speaker 1>and then when the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did an op Ed piece for the New York </v>

2265
01:56:44.431 --> 01:56:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Times and I carefully left that part </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2266
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:52.910
<v Speaker 1>I just compared to use the frank dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mangoes drawing versus the Spanx.</v>

2267
01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:55.253
<v Speaker 1>But a couple of weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a letter was published from an order </v>

2268
01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:01.200
<v Speaker 1>from an orthodontist who also knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>about faces saying,</v>

2269
01:57:01.201 --> 01:57:02.034
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2270
01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:05.220
<v Speaker 1>that swings is actually a sub Saharan </v>
<v Speaker 1>African face.</v>

2271
01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sent it.</v>

2272
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not in trouble for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway until,</v>

2273
01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:11.843
<v Speaker 1>until something better is discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sub Saharan African face and we </v>

2274
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:17.000
<v Speaker 1>don't know when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was really carved and,</v>

2275
01:57:17.001 --> 01:57:21.240
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know when it's entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that it used to be online.</v>

2276
01:57:21.241 --> 01:57:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And then some title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl came along and said,</v>

2277
01:57:23.690 --> 01:57:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2278
01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:26.423
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may have been that the head was so </v>

2279
01:57:27.751 --> 01:57:28.870
<v Speaker 1>weathered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2280
01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:31.650
<v Speaker 1>that over over time that they'd said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2281
01:57:31.890 --> 01:57:34.680
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't repair the face of the way that</v>

2282
01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:36.480
<v Speaker 1>we can repair the body.</v>

2283
01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.613
<v Speaker 1>And so they re carve the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course [inaudible] was most </v>

2284
01:57:40.711 --> 01:57:44.880
<v Speaker 1>likely still above ground while the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the body was covered.</v>

2285
01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.250
<v Speaker 1>So it was a subject to more erosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2286
01:57:47.251 --> 01:57:48.120
<v Speaker 1>it would not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2287
01:57:48.121 --> 01:57:50.730
<v Speaker 1>it's also a harder limestones so </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

2288
01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is speculation,</v>

2289
01:57:52.591 --> 01:57:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but we reckon that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an outcrop was done,</v>

2290
01:57:56.011 --> 01:57:59.250
<v Speaker 1>was sticking above the sand level to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>

2291
01:57:59.251 --> 01:58:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And somebody at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judge in years ago,</v>

2292
01:58:03.650 --> 01:58:05.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to,</v>

2293
01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:08.730
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to carve the swings by,</v>

2294
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:09.743
<v Speaker 1>by cutting around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cutting the bedrock away from </v>

2295
01:58:12.241 --> 01:58:13.074
<v Speaker 1>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the outcrop above and carving </v>

2296
01:58:15.871 --> 01:58:17.940
<v Speaker 1>that into whatever it may have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally.</v>

2297
01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It could have been an African queen </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been,</v>

2298
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:24.450
<v Speaker 1>how much information did they lose when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the library of Alexandria was burned?</v>

2299
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since it was burned,</v>

2300
01:58:25.741 --> 01:58:26.770
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2301
01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:27.613
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>1 million scrolls which dragged that </v>

2302
01:58:31.411 --> 01:58:33.660
<v Speaker 1>they had a million scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what was on that.</v>

2303
01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:35.340
<v Speaker 1>One of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my,</v>

2304
01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:40.660
<v Speaker 1>one of my dreams have dreams but um,</v>

2305
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:42.963
<v Speaker 3>sort of they didn't whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the hope is that one of these days </v>

2306
01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:54.940
<v Speaker 3>somebody turns over at spade and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2307
01:58:54.941 --> 01:58:59.941
<v Speaker 3>when in Damascus or in somewhere up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and discovers a cache of,</v>

2308
01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:02.110
<v Speaker 3>of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2309
01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 3>of hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hidden scrolls scrolls from the,</v>

2310
01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:06.333
<v Speaker 3>from the library of Alexandria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite probable that the so called </v>

2311
01:59:09.671 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 3>maps of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the sea kings,</v>

2312
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:12.933
<v Speaker 3>you know the peary reese map and some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those other things are copies of maps </v>

2313
01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:17.673
<v Speaker 3>that were originally part of the part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the library and I have a whole film </v>

2314
01:59:21.341 --> 01:59:22.174
<v Speaker 3>script actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the latest on this supposedly a </v>

2315
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:27.340
<v Speaker 3>chamber that they found in the pause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx.</v>

2316
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:30.190
<v Speaker 3>There's been some radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no us and that's awesome.</v>

2317
01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:31.033
<v Speaker 3>It's the seismograph says as the chamber</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and the seismograph doesn't </v>

2318
01:59:34.691 --> 01:59:39.490
<v Speaker 3>channel and it doesn't is united and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>geophysicist who did it said,</v>

2319
01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:40.653
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a void down that I that mean </v>

2320
01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:43.503
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a natural void that's </v>

2321
01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:50.410
<v Speaker 3>certain kinds of limestone that riddled </v>
<v Speaker 3>with those kinds of voids,</v>

2322
01:59:50.411 --> 01:59:52.240
<v Speaker 3>but this isn't that kind of limestone.</v>

2323
01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:53.373
<v Speaker 3>So more more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When when the opposition finally caves </v>

2324
01:59:57.581 --> 02:00:02.080
<v Speaker 3>in and says they never say they're wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>but and says,</v>

2325
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:03.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this deserves further study,</v>

2326
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:08.780
<v Speaker 3>then maybe we get permission to go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really look back in internet,</v>

2327
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.693
<v Speaker 3>stick a probe down to something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and see if there is indeed </v>

2328
02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:14.290
<v Speaker 3>something in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

2329
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like an important thing could</v>

2330
02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:17.794
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just to find that there's </v>

2331
02:00:18.881 --> 02:00:21.100
<v Speaker 3>something there justifying there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something there.</v>

2332
02:00:21.101 --> 02:00:22.060
<v Speaker 3>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2333
02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:23.373
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there ever been any discussion </v>

2334
02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:28.480
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever about you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2335
02:00:28.481 --> 02:00:31.720
<v Speaker 3>I know they've done all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a repair work on the Sphinx is ever,</v>

2336
02:00:31.721 --> 02:00:36.721
<v Speaker 3>ever been any discussion of taking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>limestone that was pulled from the Great</v>

2337
02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:39.123
<v Speaker 3>Pyramid and somehow or another putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>new limestone back up here to recreate </v>

2338
02:00:41.981 --> 02:00:44.890
<v Speaker 3>its original look?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2339
02:00:44.891 --> 02:00:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has ever talked about that as far</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I know.</v>

2340
02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:50.710
<v Speaker 3>But it would be a nightmarish job </v>
<v Speaker 3>because all of the,</v>

2341
02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:51.693
<v Speaker 3>all of those core blocks are all crumbly</v>
<v Speaker 3>and anamund and damage and stuff like </v>

2342
02:00:56.921 --> 02:00:57.754
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And besides,</v>

2343
02:00:58.090 --> 02:00:59.620
<v Speaker 3>they have other fish to fry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2344
02:00:59.621 --> 02:01:02.440
<v Speaker 3>they've got the technology to worry </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2345
02:01:02.610 --> 02:01:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean just if people could see what</v>

2346
02:01:04.781 --> 02:01:09.010
<v Speaker 3>it used to look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never did that when they redid it to</v>

2347
02:01:09.011 --> 02:01:11.500
<v Speaker 3>build Cairo acquired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say.</v>

2348
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:12.543
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even a hundred I've never seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>the study that actually has documented </v>

2349
02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:21.640
<v Speaker 3>where those stones are and they're big </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive stones and they slope like this.</v>

2350
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:23.470
<v Speaker 3>You can't build a bridge out of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>stones,</v>

2351
02:01:23.471 --> 02:01:24.304
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to cut the edge off with is </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost as much work as querying this </v>

2352
02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:28.810
<v Speaker 3>stuff out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the room,</v>

2353
02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 3>out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the raw quarry rock,</v>

2354
02:01:30.941 --> 02:01:33.730
<v Speaker 3>which is closer to Cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think happened?</v>

2355
02:01:33.731 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2356
02:01:35.230 --> 02:01:36.063
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not 100% happy with that </v>

2357
02:01:37.751 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a better one</v>

2358
02:01:40.610 --> 02:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2359
02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>but that one is subject to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a subject to question now.</v>

2360
02:01:47.170 --> 02:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Is it been firmly established that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was covered in smooth limestone?</v>

2361
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2362
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2363
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the,</v>

2364
02:01:54.090 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roman Greco Roman,</v>

2365
02:01:56.061 --> 02:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>his writers who were there at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>

2366
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>talked about it being absolutely perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unpenetrable.</v>

2367
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:04.603
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them said there's a rumor that </v>

2368
02:02:06.471 --> 02:02:11.471
<v Speaker 1>there was a hinged block at the entrance</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have you pushed it at or you know,</v>

2369
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>did something with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opened.</v>

2370
02:02:13.611 --> 02:02:14.444
<v Speaker 1>And I've often thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's the origin of open </v>

2371
02:02:17.301 --> 02:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>sesame and the in the thousand and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights,</v>

2372
02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>because there are a lot of certain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those thousand and one nights tales that</v>

2373
02:02:25.341 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>have their origins in ancient Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a good study.</v>

2374
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

2375
02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:32.413
<v Speaker 1>What else we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's the head of [inaudible] with </v>

2376
02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:35.654
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Falcon while very different </v>

2377
02:02:37.131 --> 02:02:37.580
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2378
02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:38.413
<v Speaker 1>They totally different face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't miss that and there's </v>

2379
02:02:41.451 --> 02:02:42.284
<v Speaker 1>more long story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were already going over here and </v>

2380
02:02:44.811 --> 02:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I won't go into here's this water </v>
<v Speaker 1>weathering that shot took one look at it</v>

2381
02:02:49.431 --> 02:02:50.264
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2382
02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>this looks like there are hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years old.</v>

2383
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Just keep going now hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

2384
02:02:55.491 --> 02:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I was is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when the geologist,</v>

2385
02:02:58.731 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't thinking what he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying he was just saying it,</v>

2386
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.313
<v Speaker 1>but it was massive water erosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was massive water erosion by a guy </v>

2387
02:03:07.761 --> 02:03:10.880
<v Speaker 1>whose expertise is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in that field.</v>

2388
02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:13.610
<v Speaker 1>So if he thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2389
02:03:13.611 --> 02:03:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he can't document that until we get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of guys.</v>

2390
02:03:15.951 --> 02:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>They're really looking seriously into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2391
02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>But how old do you think it is if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had know?</v>

2392
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2393
02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:23.893
<v Speaker 1>because of the way it's oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons they come out with </v>

2394
02:03:26.601 --> 02:03:31.601
<v Speaker 1>the date and handcock and above all </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally came out with his 11,500</v>

2395
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:36.620
<v Speaker 1>because as a processional marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's what would be the time as a</v>

2396
02:03:36.621 --> 02:03:37.454
<v Speaker 1>lion.</v>

2397
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:42.380
<v Speaker 1>That would be the time when it last saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own image in the sky.</v>

2398
02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Leo The Lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Constellation of Leo.</v>

2399
02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.670
<v Speaker 1>That would've been the last time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

2400
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's too much that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2401
02:03:48.801 --> 02:03:53.210
<v Speaker 1>It's in too chaotic a stage two to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been done.</v>

2402
02:03:53.211 --> 02:03:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Then I think it may be the press the age</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

2403
02:03:56.601 --> 02:03:57.434
<v Speaker 1>which would be about 36,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC which would correspond to the </v>

2404
02:04:00.261 --> 02:04:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian texts themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2405
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:03.643
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't surprise me if we her older </v>

2406
02:04:04.791 --> 02:04:05.624
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's until we got a bunch of geologists </v>

2407
02:04:08.241 --> 02:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>and experts in their various fields to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if they can put a fix on it and they</v>

2408
02:04:12.951 --> 02:04:15.230
<v Speaker 1>might not be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what,</v>

2409
02:04:15.231 --> 02:04:19.310
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things we look forward</v>

2410
02:04:19.311 --> 02:04:20.144
<v Speaker 1>to doing if we get permission to go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and get the funding and you're </v>

2411
02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:28.520
<v Speaker 1>important and the permissions to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and actually get this done.</v>

2412
02:04:28.521 --> 02:04:30.860
<v Speaker 1>And this is where actually we were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Egypt.</v>

2413
02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I had when I climbed up and down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid myself at 84 and um,</v>

2414
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:38.933
<v Speaker 3>we got complicated story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we did get to meet the new minister </v>

2415
02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 3>of antiquities and it was very cordial </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2416
02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.513
<v Speaker 3>and kind of listed the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to do in order to get formal </v>

2417
02:04:54.211 --> 02:04:57.810
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in any way we established a personal</v>

2418
02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>contact with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very useful.</v>

2419
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:01.283
<v Speaker 3>And then we also met up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>director of this new gigantic museum </v>

2420
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:09.180
<v Speaker 3>that they're building and that is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to open in a year or two ago.</v>

2421
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:10.403
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was very open to anything even </v>

2422
02:05:13.291 --> 02:05:17.010
<v Speaker 3>controversial that they could apply </v>
<v Speaker 3>science toe.</v>

2423
02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:21.270
<v Speaker 3>So if some of the other pieces of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip didn't go as planned,</v>

2424
02:05:21.271 --> 02:05:22.104
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't get the see some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things we wanted to see for complicated </v>

2425
02:05:24.721 --> 02:05:26.190
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

2426
02:05:26.191 --> 02:05:27.024
<v Speaker 3>that we established the potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>foothold for getting the next stage of </v>

2427
02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:32.924
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of work.</v>

2428
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Very promising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's promising.</v>

2429
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

2430
02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:37.404
<v Speaker 2>would they think that people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>form the form of you and I have only </v>

2431
02:05:39.931 --> 02:05:43.020
<v Speaker 2>been around for somewhere around 300 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>500,000</v>

2432
02:05:43.021 --> 02:05:43.854
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that right?</v>

2433
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:44.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the current thing for trout and </v>

2434
02:05:46.231 --> 02:05:46.890
<v Speaker 3>it changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2435
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:47.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changes.</v>

2436
02:05:47.671 --> 02:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>It May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's bring it back.</v>

2437
02:05:49.411 --> 02:05:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Let's go crazy and say it's a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old when,</v>

2438
02:05:51.850 --> 02:05:55.140
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and you're talking about 36,000</v>

2439
02:05:55.141 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

2440
02:05:56.011 --> 02:05:57.090
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2441
02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.193
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy to think that there was </v>

2442
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:04.500
<v Speaker 2>this period where people just throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit at each other and you know,</v>

2443
02:06:04.501 --> 02:06:06.810
<v Speaker 2>and throwing a pointed sticks in animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2444
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.300
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of barely getting by.</v>

2445
02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And then something like this just sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of erupts out of the imagination and the</v>

2446
02:06:16.891 --> 02:06:21.690
<v Speaker 2>engine nuity of people that lived tens </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of years ago.</v>

2447
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:23.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it shouldn't be that difficult </v>

2448
02:06:24.151 --> 02:06:26.070
<v Speaker 3>because as you keep going through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>slides,</v>

2449
02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:28.740
<v Speaker 3>you'll get to the Paleolithic caves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was out.</v>

2450
02:06:28.770 --> 02:06:31.080
<v Speaker 3>That's more evidence of water erosion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>

2451
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:32.040
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can it right there?</v>

2452
02:06:32.090 --> 02:06:32.401
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2453
02:06:32.401 --> 02:06:33.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I'm saying,</v>

2454
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:36.350
<v Speaker 3>but bright there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This image w right there,</v>

2455
02:06:36.351 --> 02:06:37.690
<v Speaker 3>I'll say me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which those little,</v>

2456
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:39.330
<v Speaker 3>that's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the same what?</v>

2457
02:06:39.331 --> 02:06:41.340
<v Speaker 3>What are weathering is just another view</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

2458
02:06:41.370 --> 02:06:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back end of the Sphinx.</v>

2459
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:45.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's interesting.</v>

2460
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of Mark Lane,</v>

2461
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:48.530
<v Speaker 3>his theory is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2462
02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 3>is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2463
02:06:50.130 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 3>it flaked away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2464
02:06:52.351 --> 02:06:54.630
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's responsible for these.</v>

2465
02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:58.980
<v Speaker 3>See the curved profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is a tomb that's been cut in.</v>

2466
02:06:59.490 --> 02:07:01.350
<v Speaker 3>It's old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not old kingdom.</v>

2467
02:07:01.351 --> 02:07:03.360
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what's called late kingdom,</v>

2468
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:04.493
<v Speaker 3>but it dates from about six or 700 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are the Mason's marks still </v>

2469
02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.650
<v Speaker 3>adds original stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20s,</v>

2470
02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:16.080
<v Speaker 3>2,600,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two and a half thousand years later.</v>

2471
02:07:16.230 --> 02:07:18.190
<v Speaker 3>Still perfectly visible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2472
02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:21.900
<v Speaker 3>no theory theory exploded.</v>

2473
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that definitely puts a damper on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2474
02:07:24.341 --> 02:07:25.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wind and sand erosion.</v>

2475
02:07:26.050 --> 02:07:27.190
<v Speaker 2>That too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2476
02:07:27.191 --> 02:07:28.024
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially considering that they still </v>

2477
02:07:29.981 --> 02:07:32.920
<v Speaker 2>think the spanx is 26 or 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>

2478
02:07:32.921 --> 02:07:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2479
02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:33.903
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2480
02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2481
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.390
<v Speaker 3>remember I said the second strongest </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in the world and this is not,</v>

2482
02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.433
<v Speaker 3>you don't trifle with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you think that just because </v>

2483
02:07:44.741 --> 02:07:47.560
<v Speaker 3>the evidence is good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to accept it.</v>

2484
02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:50.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're only going to accept it when you</v>

2485
02:07:50.231 --> 02:07:51.064
<v Speaker 3>beat him into the ground sufficiently so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can't get up while as long as </v>

2486
02:07:55.181 --> 02:07:58.360
<v Speaker 3>the reputation is staked on their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2487
02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:00.640
<v Speaker 3>their original assumptions being </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>

2488
02:08:00.641 --> 02:08:02.080
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2489
02:08:02.081 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 3>and so there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2490
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:04.323
<v Speaker 3>So what are we looking at here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the corner of copper for up </v>

2491
02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:06.460
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ahmed.</v>

2492
02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:09.190
<v Speaker 3>And you'll see the two very different </v>
<v Speaker 3>styles of architecture,</v>

2493
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:10.263
<v Speaker 3>the huge blocks below,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very finely dressed and the much cruder </v>

2494
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:18.340
<v Speaker 3>core masonry up above this is evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of two separate stages of construction.</v>

2495
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:23.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you had of your board of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Victorian House with an Ikea kitchen and</v>

2496
02:08:23.861 --> 02:08:26.380
<v Speaker 3>that you wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well they just decided to,</v>

2497
02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:27.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>build this Victorian House and put this </v>

2498
02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:29.380
<v Speaker 3>cool new kitchen.</v>

2499
02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:30.213
<v Speaker 3>And now you'd know in two seconds that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's two different stages of </v>

2500
02:08:33.221 --> 02:08:34.870
<v Speaker 3>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2501
02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:36.840
<v Speaker 3>we got a lot of tough stuff to cover </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2502
02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:39.513
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would stop you see where these </v>

2503
02:08:41.951 --> 02:08:44.410
<v Speaker 3>people are walking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that?</v>

2504
02:08:44.411 --> 02:08:45.244
<v Speaker 3>This one block,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see those people there and then all </v>

2505
02:08:47.861 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 3>the way down with the third guy down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is walking.</v>

2506
02:08:50.201 --> 02:08:51.034
<v Speaker 3>There's another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes down to there and then it goes </v>

2507
02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:53.353
<v Speaker 3>20 plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about 20 by 30 foot block and then </v>

2508
02:08:56.410 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 3>next to the next slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is,</v>

2509
02:08:59.531 --> 02:09:00.041
<v Speaker 3>ed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>

2510
02:09:00.041 --> 02:09:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Those are the blocks people walking on </v>
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>

2511
02:09:01.871 --> 02:09:02.704
<v Speaker 3>That's what we would just looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those blocks are about between six </v>

2512
02:09:06.101 --> 02:09:08.540
<v Speaker 3>and eight feet thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to the bottom line,</v>

2513
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:10.120
<v Speaker 3>so not only they're six and eight feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>thick,</v>

2514
02:09:10.121 --> 02:09:11.560
<v Speaker 3>but they're stacked on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

2515
02:09:11.561 --> 02:09:13.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to build it up to that level.</v>

2516
02:09:13.630 --> 02:09:14.463
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six and eight feet thick and then </v>

2517
02:09:16.571 --> 02:09:17.404
<v Speaker 3>stacked on top of another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's of a similar and I could go </v>

2518
02:09:19.541 --> 02:09:20.980
<v Speaker 3>poking back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

2519
02:09:20.981 --> 02:09:23.650
<v Speaker 3>you see the joints between the Merck </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty rough,</v>

2520
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:26.830
<v Speaker 3>but in fact if you poke back in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that they fit together,</v>

2521
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 3>that you can barely get a credit card </v>
<v Speaker 3>between them.</v>

2522
02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:30.940
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2523
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:31.481
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2524
02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:34.240
<v Speaker 3>lots and lots of weather over lots and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of years.</v>

2525
02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Then those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blocks of the great pyramid,</v>

2526
02:09:37.811 --> 02:09:38.644
<v Speaker 3>which a much smaller and almost pre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost presuppose a later state of </v>

2527
02:09:43.961 --> 02:09:44.794
<v Speaker 3>construction.</v>

2528
02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 3>We had those same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2529
02:09:49.511 --> 02:09:51.010
<v Speaker 3>that's the Red Pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2530
02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:52.870
<v Speaker 3>we're going to take up too much time </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2531
02:09:52.871 --> 02:09:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2532
02:09:54.191 --> 02:09:55.024
<v Speaker 3>That's the interior of the Red Pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see that's a megalithic </v>

2533
02:09:57.461 --> 02:09:58.294
<v Speaker 3>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always called the plundered tomb </v>

2534
02:09:59.381 --> 02:10:00.310
<v Speaker 3>chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

2535
02:10:00.311 --> 02:10:02.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not a tomb chamber because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>was ever found in,</v>

2536
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:03.664
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like any Egyptian tomb </v>

2537
02:10:05.141 --> 02:10:07.570
<v Speaker 3>chamber and B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not plundered.</v>

2538
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.550
<v Speaker 3>It's simply ruinous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2539
02:10:09.551 --> 02:10:10.360
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2540
02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.020
<v Speaker 3>this is an earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an earlier construction that for</v>

2541
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:16.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the builder of the red,</v>

2542
02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:17.283
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Red Pyramid decided to incorporate that </v>

2543
02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:20.853
<v Speaker 3>into his pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like an Ikea kitchen </v>

2544
02:10:24.070 --> 02:10:29.050
<v Speaker 3>incorporated into the Victorian House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that was there before and</v>

2545
02:10:29.051 --> 02:10:29.884
<v Speaker 3>that they built the pyramid on top of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some older construction and </v>

2546
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 3>then in a better,</v>

2547
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:35.820
<v Speaker 4>more stay up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

2548
02:10:35.850 --> 02:10:36.683
<v Speaker 4>stop moving a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what you're seeing the lower cruder </v>

2549
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:43.770
<v Speaker 4>level is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an older method of construction.</v>

2550
02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.040
<v Speaker 4>Then above it you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look really smooth.</v>

2551
02:10:46.190 --> 02:10:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2552
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:49.160
<v Speaker 1>My Macho well and also he has a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth,</v>

2553
02:10:49.161 --> 02:10:51.260
<v Speaker 1>because it's in perfect shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>

2554
02:10:51.261 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 1>it's at the inside of the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

2555
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:55.130
<v Speaker 1>nothing could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it was done yesterday,</v>

2556
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:58.340
<v Speaker 1>whereas the bottom has been out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weather for a long time.</v>

2557
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's measured by,</v>

2558
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:05.450
<v Speaker 1>it's weathered it not like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like the exterior of the Sphinx,</v>

2559
02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's style is typically is typically</v>

2560
02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:11.293
<v Speaker 1>a megalithic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like certain to the </v>

2561
02:11:12.381 --> 02:11:13.214
<v Speaker 1>constructions in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ireland and Scotland and Wales and </v>

2562
02:11:15.611 --> 02:11:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Megalithic instructions there.</v>

2563
02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 4>So you mean like a cruder cutting much,</v>

2564
02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:23.740
<v Speaker 1>much cruder but dating from an earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

2565
02:11:23.741 --> 02:11:24.670
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7,000</v>

2566
02:11:24.671 --> 02:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>pcs.</v>

2567
02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:28.920
<v Speaker 4>So much like when they go and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>excavations in Mexico City,</v>

2568
02:11:28.921 --> 02:11:29.754
<v Speaker 4>they're always build.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're building buildings down there </v>

2569
02:11:31.261 --> 02:11:32.094
<v Speaker 4>and they have to stop construction </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they find like some ancient </v>

2570
02:11:33.751 --> 02:11:34.584
<v Speaker 4>pyramid or something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what this is is they had an old </v>

2571
02:11:38.101 --> 02:11:40.710
<v Speaker 4>structure and they built the new stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>on top of it.</v>

2572
02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:43.680
<v Speaker 4>The new stuff is what we think of as the</v>
<v Speaker 4>original structure,</v>

2573
02:11:43.710 --> 02:11:46.950
<v Speaker 4>but there's evidence the point that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some ancient stuff below that.</v>

2574
02:11:47.010 --> 02:11:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2575
02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2576
02:11:50.131 --> 02:11:50.930
<v Speaker 4>And what do we got here?</v>

2577
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Well I that's more of shotgun myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2578
02:11:55.551 --> 02:11:58.550
<v Speaker 1>This is another piece of the puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of Abi dose,</v>

2579
02:11:59.030 --> 02:12:01.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the temple itself.</v>

2580
02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Temple this off to the right and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2581
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:06.223
<v Speaker 1>a good friend of mine has just done an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate book on this and even though </v>

2582
02:12:09.261 --> 02:12:13.610
<v Speaker 1>he's not an egyptologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being academically published,</v>

2583
02:12:14.090 --> 02:12:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's going into into all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things having to do with this strange</v>

2584
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:19.814
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most resonating </v>

2585
02:12:21.021 --> 02:12:24.650
<v Speaker 1>powerful places in all of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are convinced,</v>

2586
02:12:24.651 --> 02:12:29.030
<v Speaker 1>shocking myself that that was central </v>
<v Speaker 1>pillars date from a much earlier period.</v>

2587
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And then the rest of the temple is Seti </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

2588
02:12:31.611 --> 02:12:32.444
<v Speaker 1>which is about 1300 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is to elaborate to get into </v>

2589
02:12:35.841 --> 02:12:37.220
<v Speaker 1>here and I'm running out of words.</v>

2590
02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that it's older</v>

2591
02:12:39.930 --> 02:12:42.350
<v Speaker 1>one construction method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>style,</v>

2592
02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.920
<v Speaker 1>style of construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly style of construction and the way</v>

2593
02:12:46.921 --> 02:12:51.330
<v Speaker 1>that it's sided sort of buried into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

2594
02:12:51.331 --> 02:12:52.164
<v Speaker 1>which is almost unheard of in it for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian temple to be constructed into </v>

2595
02:12:58.440 --> 02:12:59.273
<v Speaker 1>as a subterranean structure would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a roof over it and so on at some </v>

2596
02:13:02.041 --> 02:13:04.800
<v Speaker 1>point or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

2597
02:13:04.801 --> 02:13:06.600
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated issue.</v>

2598
02:13:06.601 --> 02:13:09.510
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fills up with water sometimes and now</v>

2599
02:13:09.511 --> 02:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>they won't let you end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2600
02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:15.620
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is with the,</v>

2601
02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.690
<v Speaker 1>this is us actually I the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Goonie oh.</v>

2602
02:13:18.710 --> 02:13:21.120
<v Speaker 1>And John Hancock and myself and handcock</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2603
02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:22.493
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Graham's still now he's getting a </v>

2604
02:13:27.061 --> 02:13:29.640
<v Speaker 1>bit cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cautious about it,</v>

2605
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 1>but we went finance</v>

2606
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>while this mega millionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2607
02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2608
02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.700
<v Speaker 3>industrialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2609
02:13:38.730 --> 02:13:39.541
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2610
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:42.120
<v Speaker 3>he wants it to prove the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Maria.</v>

2611
02:13:42.510 --> 02:13:44.670
<v Speaker 3>And as you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of those geometric,</v>

2612
02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks there.</v>

2613
02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:50.040
<v Speaker 3>And Chuck and I came to the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>after a week of diving there,</v>

2614
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 3>that seductive as it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is a natural,</v>

2615
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:59.070
<v Speaker 3>entirely a natural way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could even see,</v>

2616
02:13:59.071 --> 02:13:59.904
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the pictures of it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the last day we there they could </v>

2617
02:14:02.071 --> 02:14:04.280
<v Speaker 3>even see the way that it was formed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2618
02:14:04.730 --> 02:14:09.730
<v Speaker 3>the nature of the Rock and the action of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the waves and the terrific tides that,</v>

2619
02:14:10.061 --> 02:14:12.810
<v Speaker 3>that prevail there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what this,</v>

2620
02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:14.280
<v Speaker 3>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell.</v>

2621
02:14:14.670 --> 02:14:15.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2622
02:14:16.170 --> 02:14:18.550
<v Speaker 4>well you were so you actually did the </v>
<v Speaker 4>diving down there?</v>

2623
02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2624
02:14:21.190 --> 02:14:23.170
<v Speaker 3>when was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

2625
02:14:23.171 --> 02:14:26.650
<v Speaker 3>12 years ago in my seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2626
02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:28.180
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty gangster thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2627
02:14:28.181 --> 02:14:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Well good</v>

2628
02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:31.570
<v Speaker 4>down the bottom of the ocean when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>70 checking out rocks.</v>

2629
02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:32.593
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't like being underwater </v>

2630
02:14:34.251 --> 02:14:36.110
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for archaeology I'll do it.</v>

2631
02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>

2632
02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:43.313
<v Speaker 3>Oh well this is the famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the famous cartoon that some </v>

2633
02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:48.630
<v Speaker 3>people think or his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are now,</v>

2634
02:14:48.631 --> 02:14:49.464
<v Speaker 3>these are the Paleolithic caves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the best of them called </v>

2635
02:14:51.841 --> 02:14:53.700
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is day two,</v>

2636
02:14:53.701 --> 02:14:56.730
<v Speaker 3>this is in France or this is in France </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this day date,</v>

2637
02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 3>they date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not us.</v>

2638
02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:00.960
<v Speaker 3>They date to 31,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC or older.</v>

2639
02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:04.890
<v Speaker 3>This is genius stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2640
02:15:06.710 --> 02:15:10.910
<v Speaker 3>great artists did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great artists are not primitive then you</v>

2641
02:15:10.911 --> 02:15:15.290
<v Speaker 3>might be shooting arrows at rhinoceroses</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat and why not?</v>

2642
02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:16.153
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot better than going to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarket and the organic or you have </v>

2643
02:15:19.131 --> 02:15:23.120
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never heard of a gmo rhinoceros but,</v>

2644
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:27.320
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fabulous work and who knows what</v>

2645
02:15:27.321 --> 02:15:30.320
<v Speaker 3>was going on the rest of the time when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing this in the dark,</v>

2646
02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.100
<v Speaker 3>hidden away in these caves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is 31,000</v>

2647
02:15:34.101 --> 02:15:37.610
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the date where us of 36,000</v>

2648
02:15:37.611 --> 02:15:39.630
<v Speaker 3>or thereabouts for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2649
02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:44.800
<v Speaker 3>for the spanx and all of that is not as </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of out of the question as,</v>

2650
02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:49.180
<v Speaker 3>as you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they date this the 31,000.</v>

2651
02:15:49.181 --> 02:15:52.730
<v Speaker 3>And this presupposes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2652
02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:57.940
<v Speaker 3>an extremely sophisticated art artistry </v>
<v Speaker 3>and supremely sophisticated art.</v>

2653
02:16:00.461 --> 02:16:05.461
<v Speaker 3>History is not done by morons or by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by primitives.</v>

2654
02:16:07.550 --> 02:16:10.670
<v Speaker 3>It just isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>

2655
02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Look at this great stuff.</v>

2656
02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they definitely had a very good sense of</v>

2657
02:16:17.981 --> 02:16:18.814
<v Speaker 4>how to capture what these animals that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they worshiped and went after looked </v>

2658
02:16:23.111 --> 02:16:24.400
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was a crazy,</v>

2659
02:16:24.401 --> 02:16:27.240
<v Speaker 4>here you see that looks like a rhino </v>
<v Speaker 4>down there and horses.</v>

2660
02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:28.211
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2661
02:16:28.211 --> 02:16:32.410
<v Speaker 3>And the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild horses mile or maybe go back.</v>

2662
02:16:32.411 --> 02:16:35.850
<v Speaker 3>We tapped the artists artists study of </v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to time.</v>

2663
02:16:36.550 --> 02:16:37.383
<v Speaker 3>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they've only uncovered less </v>

2664
02:16:38.861 --> 02:16:41.200
<v Speaker 3>than 10% of go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We test much less,</v>

2665
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:42.063
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 5% or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they work well now it's near the </v>

2666
02:16:45.161 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Syrian border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God knows what they're doing,</v>

2667
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:50.590
<v Speaker 3>but they're covering it over because </v>
<v Speaker 3>once they started excavating it,</v>

2668
02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:51.593
<v Speaker 3>I've been protected by the fill role of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these thousands of years and it started </v>

2669
02:16:55.391 --> 02:16:56.224
<v Speaker 3>deteriorating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now they've unfortunately you can no </v>

2670
02:16:58.481 --> 02:17:01.270
<v Speaker 3>longer see it the way the chalk and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>saw it six,</v>

2671
02:17:01.271 --> 02:17:03.640
<v Speaker 3>seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are they covering it with?</v>

2672
02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got sheds and roofs.</v>

2673
02:17:05.641 --> 02:17:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Silver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It completely destroyed.</v>

2674
02:17:07.901 --> 02:17:09.490
<v Speaker 3>It's magic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't blame them.</v>

2675
02:17:10.090 --> 02:17:12.010
<v Speaker 3>The weather is getting at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2676
02:17:12.011 --> 02:17:13.570
<v Speaker 3>they've only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did they discover this?</v>

2677
02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:15.053
<v Speaker 3>It was actually discovered in the 1994 </v>
<v Speaker 3>or so and they've been working on it </v>

2678
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:24.270
<v Speaker 3>ever since and it only came into public </v>
<v Speaker 3>view around 2004 or there abouts.</v>

2679
02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:27.553
<v Speaker 3>And here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's some of the detail and which is </v>

2680
02:17:28.991 --> 02:17:29.824
<v Speaker 3>why shock is fascinated by this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing of the </v>

2681
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:33.243
<v Speaker 3>anthropomorphic of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the hands grasping around the corner </v>

2682
02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:41.440
<v Speaker 3>that's doing that was something almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>identical to that.</v>

2683
02:17:41.441 --> 02:17:42.274
<v Speaker 3>And Easter Island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think Easter island plays a role in </v>

2684
02:17:44.531 --> 02:17:47.850
<v Speaker 3>this whole lost civilization hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2685
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:51.040
<v Speaker 3>that's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2686
02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:51.874
<v Speaker 3>this has raised relief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to chop the soane cut or a </v>

2687
02:17:54.221 --> 02:17:56.410
<v Speaker 3>braid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stone away from the figures.</v>

2688
02:17:56.411 --> 02:17:58.960
<v Speaker 3>This is tough to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's three d stuff.</v>

2689
02:17:58.961 --> 02:17:59.794
<v Speaker 3>And also aren't there to animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>depicted on these things that aren't </v>

2690
02:18:02.441 --> 02:18:03.274
<v Speaker 3>even local.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even available in that </v>

2691
02:18:05.201 --> 02:18:07.570
<v Speaker 3>continent and on nor did they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a history of these animals.</v>

2692
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I am not sure this is what this one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2693
02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:11.553
<v Speaker 3>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a kind of a feline of some </v>

2694
02:18:12.881 --> 02:18:14.260
<v Speaker 3>sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2695
02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:18.180
<v Speaker 3>hard to tell exactly what it is cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stylized with it.</v>

2696
02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:20.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty brilliant piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sculpture and you have to,</v>

2697
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:21.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carve away the holds stone surface in </v>

2698
02:18:23.651 --> 02:18:26.620
<v Speaker 3>order to get at that with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if they,</v>

2699
02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:30.200
<v Speaker 3>if they know or some eyes what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2700
02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I definitely would start some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like half cuma,</v>

2701
02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:34.830
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a humorous,</v>

2702
02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:39.250
<v Speaker 3>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bead that they found there from</v>

2703
02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:44.140
<v Speaker 3>go back to the topic and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a big mystery in a small bead.</v>

2704
02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:45.730
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did they drill that hole?</v>

2705
02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:47.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2706
02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:50.080
<v Speaker 3>very hard stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very hard stone.</v>

2707
02:18:50.081 --> 02:18:54.040
<v Speaker 3>A very small stone to sitting in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand that's about the size of yours.</v>

2708
02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:57.910
<v Speaker 3>You're the last digit of your thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tiny.</v>

2709
02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:58.913
<v Speaker 3>It's tiny and it's thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a tiny little hole in </v>

2710
02:19:01.631 --> 02:19:02.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2711
02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.900
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a time where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was no steel.</v>

2712
02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:06.730
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how did they do that?</v>

2713
02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:07.593
<v Speaker 3>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of pottery in Egypt in </v>

2714
02:19:10.661 --> 02:19:15.220
<v Speaker 3>terms of a carved stone where they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>zero idea how they,</v>

2715
02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:19.060
<v Speaker 3>how they constructed it with a very thin</v>
<v Speaker 3>lip and then it goes inside contour.</v>

2716
02:19:19.061 --> 02:19:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have one of those there.</v>

2717
02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:21.933
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a bracelet found recently in </v>

2718
02:19:24.581 --> 02:19:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had made of Obsidian,</v>

2719
02:19:26.051 --> 02:19:31.040
<v Speaker 3>which is an almost impossible stone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work with and the ridges on it.</v>

2720
02:19:31.130 --> 02:19:32.090
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2721
02:19:32.091 --> 02:19:36.110
<v Speaker 3>not us have found by doing a careful </v>
<v Speaker 3>study of it geometrically,</v>

2722
02:19:36.111 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 3>that it's very sophisticated geometry at</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2723
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I forget exactly what it is that set at </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue here,</v>

2724
02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's not just a cup of cavemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying like,</v>

2725
02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:47.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife is pissed off at me,</v>

2726
02:19:47.241 --> 02:19:49.640
<v Speaker 3>so I better give her something nice for </v>
<v Speaker 3>our anniversary.</v>

2727
02:19:50.010 --> 02:19:50.661
<v Speaker 3>Clark said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2728
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:52.640
<v Speaker 3>here's a nice chunk of obsidian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll,</v>

2729
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2730
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll do a little bracelet for her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how all this is.</v>

2731
02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>The data is by the Strada that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in around 8,000</v>

2732
02:20:01.341 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2733
02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2734
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:06.890
<v Speaker 3>This is more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Sardinia,</v>

2735
02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:11.920
<v Speaker 3>which is a treasure of Megalithic UN </v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood.</v>

2736
02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Look at these extreme plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

2737
02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:19.010
<v Speaker 3>We think shotgun myself that this may be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of,</v>

2738
02:20:19.011 --> 02:20:19.844
<v Speaker 3>this may be an answer to this massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>coronal mass ejection that happened </v>

2739
02:20:25.701 --> 02:20:29.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe thousands of years earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in people are still building things</v>

2740
02:20:29.931 --> 02:20:32.720
<v Speaker 3>to keep them safe from another one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>

2741
02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:33.733
<v Speaker 3>Now what would be the effect of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coronal mass ejection right now but </v>

2742
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:40.420
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right as far as it'd be now it would,</v>

2743
02:20:40.430 --> 02:20:41.263
<v Speaker 3>it would kill the satellites and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would freeze the we'd read it would fry </v>

2744
02:20:45.711 --> 02:20:46.544
<v Speaker 3>the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean instantly the only people who </v>

2745
02:20:49.521 --> 02:20:50.354
<v Speaker 3>would hang the only people who would </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive or the survivalist who are off </v>

2746
02:20:54.411 --> 02:20:57.840
<v Speaker 3>the grid that because we're all assholes</v>
<v Speaker 3>with those kinds of survivalist.</v>

2747
02:20:57.880 --> 02:20:58.713
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah that was those kinds of cars but </v>

2748
02:21:00.891 --> 02:21:05.270
<v Speaker 3>other people are off the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know doing um,</v>

2749
02:21:05.450 --> 02:21:09.830
<v Speaker 3>my pal clay who's here buying tena extra</v>
<v Speaker 3>acres that I have,</v>

2750
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:11.083
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing anything with and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning to in fact do exactly that to </v>

2751
02:21:15.081 --> 02:21:15.914
<v Speaker 3>go off the grid and build a permaculture</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 acre self sustaining self sustaining </v>

2752
02:21:20.620 --> 02:21:21.453
<v Speaker 3>is a great way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To have like a farm and if you can </v>

2753
02:21:24.141 --> 02:21:27.950
<v Speaker 3>afford the land and have solar power and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that counseling well water,</v>

2754
02:21:28.170 --> 02:21:31.130
<v Speaker 3>a few people are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>

2755
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:33.590
<v Speaker 3>There are some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know when,</v>

2756
02:21:33.591 --> 02:21:37.520
<v Speaker 3>when the world is overpopulated to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent that it is,</v>

2757
02:21:37.521 --> 02:21:41.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to get to an awful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people very quickly.</v>

2758
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:43.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to do.</v>

2759
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:44.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the interior of those </v>

2760
02:21:45.681 --> 02:21:46.514
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary neurology they called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So identity is incredible place </v>

2761
02:21:49.221 --> 02:21:49.720
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

2762
02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:53.000
<v Speaker 3>And that's an Italy right island off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coast of,</v>

2763
02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.140
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they date?</v>

2764
02:21:57.141 --> 02:22:00.650
<v Speaker 3>These two will Bei data to 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 3>or so,</v>

2765
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:02.180
<v Speaker 3>2,600</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>

2766
02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:04.850
<v Speaker 3>And Chuck and I questioned that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have,</v>

2767
02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:06.163
<v Speaker 3>we don't have any data that that tells </v>
<v Speaker 3>us otherwise was that is the stone </v>

2768
02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.950
<v Speaker 3>circle in Egypt and knobbed apply as </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called,</v>

2769
02:22:12.951 --> 02:22:16.700
<v Speaker 3>that it looks completely fragmented and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>

2770
02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:20.630
<v Speaker 3>but in fact even this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the academics,</v>

2771
02:22:20.631 --> 02:22:21.464
<v Speaker 3>the Rko astronomers acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>architect is astronomically and there's </v>

2772
02:22:26.911 --> 02:22:27.744
<v Speaker 3>a physicist archioffice Toronto named </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Brophy who studied it much more </v>

2773
02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:33.744
<v Speaker 3>carefully and has found much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated alignments than just </v>

2774
02:22:38.731 --> 02:22:40.770
<v Speaker 3>salts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an equinox is again,</v>

2775
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.440
<v Speaker 3>cause that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a common thread in ancient,</v>

2776
02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:45.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture,</v>

2777
02:22:45.001 --> 02:22:46.950
<v Speaker 3>which is really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>

2778
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.983
<v Speaker 3>the alignment with a celestial bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mayans always big on that little way as </v>

2779
02:22:53.101 --> 02:22:53.934
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing back to procession </v>

2780
02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:57.960
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2781
02:22:57.961 --> 02:23:02.100
<v Speaker 3>But with the evidence is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and the festivals and all sorts of</v>

2782
02:23:02.101 --> 02:23:05.520
<v Speaker 3>things like that are attuned take place </v>
<v Speaker 3>at these,</v>

2783
02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:08.460
<v Speaker 3>at these critical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these critical,</v>

2784
02:23:08.461 --> 02:23:12.330
<v Speaker 3>let's call them energy points and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>

2785
02:23:12.331 --> 02:23:13.770
<v Speaker 3>and it's quite clear that they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2786
02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:18.810
<v Speaker 3>is that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're orchestrating their attire,</v>

2787
02:23:18.811 --> 02:23:19.644
<v Speaker 3>civilization that tuning their entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization to the movements of the </v>

2788
02:23:23.131 --> 02:23:23.964
<v Speaker 3>heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is quite clear and this you can </v>

2789
02:23:26.041 --> 02:23:28.860
<v Speaker 3>kind of demonstrate what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieving by that.</v>

2790
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:32.850
<v Speaker 3>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very important to them.</v>

2791
02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:35.930
<v Speaker 3>What are we go here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More,</v>

2792
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:38.880
<v Speaker 3>more of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Devil's Dick.</v>

2793
02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>close.</v>

2794
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:41.790
<v Speaker 3>It looks so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2795
02:23:41.850 --> 02:23:45.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not apply.</v>

2796
02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:46.163
<v Speaker 3>And that just the drawing and not apply </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this is this gets into complications </v>

2797
02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:52.104
<v Speaker 3>of the cosmology of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the dog and this is the work of </v>

2798
02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:58.890
<v Speaker 3>my good friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a layered scranton who you may know of,</v>

2799
02:23:58.900 --> 02:23:59.733
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2800
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Dogon tribe,</v>

2801
02:24:01.411 --> 02:24:02.244
<v Speaker 3>that's a tribe to think that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come from the constellation </v>

2802
02:24:04.141 --> 02:24:05.490
<v Speaker 3>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well where,</v>

2803
02:24:05.491 --> 02:24:07.120
<v Speaker 3>who think they got their knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday?</v>

2804
02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:09.560
<v Speaker 3>It comes to it through them directly </v>
<v Speaker 3>from serious,</v>

2805
02:24:09.561 --> 02:24:11.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they think they come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious,</v>

2806
02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

2807
02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:19.310
<v Speaker 3>layered work started out just as a sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of amateur thing.</v>

2808
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:22.403
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for looking into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmology of the Dogan and at a certain </v>

2809
02:24:26.611 --> 02:24:30.690
<v Speaker 3>point he decides to see how that matches</v>
<v Speaker 3>current cock in technology.</v>

2810
02:24:30.690 --> 02:24:31.523
<v Speaker 3>He's a techie guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a expert in computer languages and </v>

2811
02:24:34.471 --> 02:24:35.460
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

2812
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.820
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's very good at this kind of work.</v>

2813
02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:43.490
<v Speaker 3>And he finds that in the first book of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his called science at the Dogan,</v>

2814
02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:47.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this Dogan cosmology of this,</v>

2815
02:24:47.390 --> 02:24:50.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read the Sim simple tribe in,</v>

2816
02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:52.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>western western Africa,</v>

2817
02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Mali,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mali,</v>

2818
02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2819
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:59.490
<v Speaker 3>has their cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2820
02:24:59.790 --> 02:25:00.623
<v Speaker 3>they know about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can transmit it is in fact </v>

2821
02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:04.223
<v Speaker 3>consistent with the latest wrinkles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>string theory in torsion theory in high </v>

2822
02:25:09.241 --> 02:25:11.040
<v Speaker 3>energy physics and all that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2823
02:25:11.430 --> 02:25:16.110
<v Speaker 3>And then that led him to the study of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other civilizations and he's now,</v>

2824
02:25:16.111 --> 02:25:16.944
<v Speaker 3>it was six or seven books into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really what he's doing as he's not </v>

2825
02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:22.073
<v Speaker 3>just talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unrecognized by a handful of </v>

2826
02:25:24.041 --> 02:25:24.521
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2827
02:25:24.521 --> 02:25:26.620
<v Speaker 3>they're hot by sellers and the written </v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

2828
02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:28.660
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very simple and easy to find,</v>

2829
02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:31.450
<v Speaker 3>easy to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2830
02:25:31.451 --> 02:25:32.284
<v Speaker 3>he's showing that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this complex cosmology is understood </v>

2831
02:25:37.961 --> 02:25:42.370
<v Speaker 3>unexpressed by every society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually every society that he's looked</v>

2832
02:25:42.371 --> 02:25:44.530
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the Chinese.</v>

2833
02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:45.813
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a relatively recent book and </v>

2834
02:25:47.471 --> 02:25:52.471
<v Speaker 3>he's ending up by with a master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture puzzle of all of these ancient</v>

2835
02:25:53.770 --> 02:25:56.110
<v Speaker 3>civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No dating them.</v>

2836
02:25:56.111 --> 02:25:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's become quite clear through this</v>

2837
02:25:59.381 --> 02:26:04.381
<v Speaker 3>body of work that the ancients had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>

2838
02:26:05.470 --> 02:26:06.303
<v Speaker 3>the fact that Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same cosmology and the same </v>

2839
02:26:08.531 --> 02:26:12.340
<v Speaker 3>understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we think that this is a hand me down</v>

2840
02:26:12.341 --> 02:26:16.210
<v Speaker 3>from the ancient civilization that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>busy trying to,</v>

2841
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:20.230
<v Speaker 3>to validate and the</v>

2842
02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:24.520
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] the survivors of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>coronal mass,</v>

2843
02:26:24.521 --> 02:26:25.450
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2844
02:26:25.451 --> 02:26:26.284
<v Speaker 6>the survivors of the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pdf that existed before the coronal </v>

2845
02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:31.480
<v Speaker 6>mass that achieve some sort of a high </v>
<v Speaker 6>level of sophistication.</v>

2846
02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:34.750
<v Speaker 6>And then these people with whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>knowledge was leftover,</v>

2847
02:26:34.751 --> 02:26:35.584
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had managed to save something of </v>

2848
02:26:37.421 --> 02:26:38.254
<v Speaker 6>that sort or they with the same people </v>
<v Speaker 6>who are everywhere and had it to begin </v>

2849
02:26:41.021 --> 02:26:42.160
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're seeing up here,</v>

2850
02:26:42.161 --> 02:26:42.994
<v Speaker 6>figure 12.4</v>
<v Speaker 6>the quantum fresno frenzy can cause a </v>

2851
02:26:45.461 --> 02:26:49.990
<v Speaker 6>string anti string pair to erupt and </v>
<v Speaker 6>annihilate yielding and more complicated</v>

2852
02:26:49.991 --> 02:26:51.160
<v Speaker 6>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that,</v>

2853
02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:52.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's from,</v>

2854
02:26:52.450 --> 02:26:54.910
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's from the physics lab actually.</v>

2855
02:26:54.911 --> 02:26:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Are they talking about,</v>

2856
02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:00.460
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure if it's like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 6>geometry thing and,</v>

2857
02:27:00.461 --> 02:27:04.780
<v Speaker 6>or the physics thing and they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 6>at this is Dogan art,</v>

2858
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:05.860
<v Speaker 6>is that what this is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2859
02:27:05.861 --> 02:27:10.861
<v Speaker 6>but Dogan has has that figure in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep going down</v>

2860
02:27:11.310 --> 02:27:11.971
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2861
02:27:11.971 --> 02:27:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's say there's some way the Dogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that there.</v>

2862
02:27:16.221 --> 02:27:17.540
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is it,</v>

2863
02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:18.383
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2864
02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:21.273
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2865
02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:23.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

2866
02:27:23.530 --> 02:27:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the one right after.</v>

2867
02:27:25.811 --> 02:27:29.820
<v Speaker 3>It says very close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

2868
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:30.663
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it once you have to read Larry's </v>

2869
02:27:31.811 --> 02:27:34.140
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science of the dog,</v>

2870
02:27:34.141 --> 02:27:34.974
<v Speaker 3>and that's really all there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's the same in all of the </v>

2871
02:27:37.511 --> 02:27:40.000
<v Speaker 3>civilizations all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I said earlier,</v>

2872
02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:44.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dislike,</v>

2873
02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:46.380
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2874
02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Using the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible for,</v>

2875
02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.260
<v Speaker 3>for scholarship because it's a minefield</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know.</v>

2876
02:27:52.530 --> 02:27:54.000
<v Speaker 3>You can select from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2877
02:27:54.030 --> 02:27:54.863
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inquisitor's found a way to justify </v>

2878
02:27:56.371 --> 02:27:57.204
<v Speaker 3>the inquisition from the Bible and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can justify just about anything with so </v>

2879
02:28:00.911 --> 02:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>much craziness in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much,</v>

2880
02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:07.830
<v Speaker 3>so much craziness going on in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one thing that did strike me and the</v>

2881
02:28:07.831 --> 02:28:11.040
<v Speaker 3>correspondence is our correspondence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

2882
02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:14.940
<v Speaker 3>one of the intriguing bits of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

2883
02:28:14.970 --> 02:28:16.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2884
02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:20.490
<v Speaker 3>I forget where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tower of Babel of it's exodus or no,</v>

2885
02:28:20.491 --> 02:28:22.560
<v Speaker 3>can't be activist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genesis</v>

2886
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:23.361
<v Speaker 1>may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2887
02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:27.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the early books of the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they talk about the tower of Babel</v>

2888
02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:30.320
<v Speaker 1>and one of the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very suggestive,</v>

2889
02:28:30.321 --> 02:28:35.300
<v Speaker 1>is this before the or before the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tower was built,</v>

2890
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:40.190
<v Speaker 1>all of all of humanity spoken one </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>

2891
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.550
<v Speaker 1>The eskimos spoke the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polynesians.</v>

2892
02:28:43.551 --> 02:28:44.261
<v Speaker 1>What is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2893
02:28:44.261 --> 02:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>in the Polynesians spoke Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't seem,</v>

2894
02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:48.513
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the linguists don't find that </v>

2895
02:28:50.241 --> 02:28:51.074
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the common language that they </v>

2896
02:28:53.181 --> 02:28:57.920
<v Speaker 1>spoke was the cosmology and laird finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same cosmology wherever he looks.</v>

2897
02:28:58.490 --> 02:29:01.790
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not anything that you can base,</v>

2898
02:29:02.970 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be sure of it,</v>

2899
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:09.370
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly that that's strange line </v>
<v Speaker 1>does have some corroboration.</v>

2900
02:29:10.650 --> 02:29:11.483
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very hard for us to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>into perspective what it would be like </v>

2901
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.903
<v Speaker 4>if there was some sort of a high level </v>
<v Speaker 4>of sophistication involved in the </v>

2902
02:29:18.271 --> 02:29:21.270
<v Speaker 4>society back then and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced whatever it was,</v>

2903
02:29:21.271 --> 02:29:22.104
<v Speaker 4>whether it was meteor showers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>supervolcanoes what that asteroid has </v>

2904
02:29:25.471 --> 02:29:26.304
<v Speaker 4>dried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2905
02:29:26.430 --> 02:29:27.263
<v Speaker 4>and whatever it is and then trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>retain a certain amount of it and pass </v>

2906
02:29:32.101 --> 02:29:32.934
<v Speaker 4>it onto your children and how things </v>
<v Speaker 4>would get so convoluted and distorted </v>

2907
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:38.400
<v Speaker 4>and there'd be very little left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2908
02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:40.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like then it's an,</v>

2909
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:45.710
<v Speaker 4>but the people would be of the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>sophistication in terms of the same kind</v>

2910
02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:50.130
<v Speaker 4>of minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same sized brains,</v>

2911
02:29:50.131 --> 02:29:50.964
<v Speaker 4>the same capability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would just have to relearn </v>

2912
02:29:52.711 --> 02:29:52.900
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2913
02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Hang all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's this.</v>

2914
02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:55.493
<v Speaker 1>This is a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a good case that can be </v>

2915
02:29:57.821 --> 02:30:02.821
<v Speaker 1>made for that because stuff gets after </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're after this cat catastrophe.</v>

2916
02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Things really do go into a tailspin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then around 3000 BC,</v>

2917
02:30:11.291 --> 02:30:12.400
<v Speaker 1>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC,</v>

2918
02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:18.180
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated civilizations arise,</v>

2919
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:23.050
<v Speaker 1>but based upon this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ancient knowledge though the,</v>

2920
02:30:23.051 --> 02:30:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the mythology is all there to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2921
02:30:24.911 --> 02:30:27.080
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly the Sumerian around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

2922
02:30:27.081 --> 02:30:28.510
<v Speaker 1>this Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2923
02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:32.080
<v Speaker 1>there's China for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's India and all of these,</v>

2924
02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:33.693
<v Speaker 1>all of these seem to arrive at a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level of understanding around that </v>

2925
02:30:38.771 --> 02:30:40.330
<v Speaker 1>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so he date,</v>

2926
02:30:40.510 --> 02:30:43.560
<v Speaker 4>especially Samir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they go over some of the ancient,</v>

2927
02:30:43.561 --> 02:30:44.394
<v Speaker 4>those saw clay tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they see the depictions of the </v>

2928
02:30:46.501 --> 02:30:49.380
<v Speaker 4>solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where it gets really confusing.</v>

2929
02:30:49.381 --> 02:30:51.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell did they know this?</v>

2930
02:30:51.091 --> 02:30:51.924
<v Speaker 4>How do they know that there was a sun in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the center and then all these planets </v>

2931
02:30:54.241 --> 02:30:56.580
<v Speaker 4>were in the correct size?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2932
02:30:56.581 --> 02:30:59.910
<v Speaker 4>they had jupiter and the correct size </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the correct position.</v>

2933
02:30:59.911 --> 02:31:02.970
<v Speaker 4>Mars in the correct position was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very strange stuff.</v>

2934
02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:04.980
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ever seen.</v>

2935
02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:06.653
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you are followed Zacharias hitch </v>

2936
02:31:08.101 --> 02:31:10.590
<v Speaker 4>and stuff was he's got some really wacky</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2937
02:31:10.591 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Well it is wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peter Fonda read if you're hot.</v>

2938
02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:14.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a the Annunaki and those from </v>

2939
02:31:17.581 --> 02:31:18.414
<v Speaker 4>heaven to Earth came and people out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>monkeys and alien DNA is a galactic </v>

2940
02:31:24.301 --> 02:31:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Darwinian while he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he's how he's always wearing food</v>

2941
02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:30.310
<v Speaker 3>and I call his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call him,</v>

2942
02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:32.220
<v Speaker 3>I called his father was switching in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2943
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:35.031
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2944
02:31:35.031 --> 02:31:39.560
<v Speaker 4>I read the use for the 12th planet to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that was called the 12th planet.</v>

2945
02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Horrible stuff yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you know,</v>

2946
02:31:41.871 --> 02:31:43.370
<v Speaker 4>when you don't know anything it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

2947
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:49.230
<v Speaker 4>But I pull up the image Jamie of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to show it to 'em John of the solar</v>

2948
02:31:51.291 --> 02:31:55.820
<v Speaker 4>system depiction in the clay tablets </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's really fascinating stuff.</v>

2949
02:31:55.821 --> 02:31:58.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean it clearly shows a son with what </v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2950
02:31:58.880 --> 02:31:59.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2951
02:31:59.301 --> 02:32:00.134
<v Speaker 4>our standard sort of image of a sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a circle and the radiating sort of </v>

2952
02:32:03.441 --> 02:32:04.274
<v Speaker 4>lines outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it has all these planets </v>

2953
02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:08.270
<v Speaker 4>circling around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2954
02:32:08.271 --> 02:32:09.470
<v Speaker 4>there it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

2955
02:32:10.890 --> 02:32:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun is a star.</v>

2956
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.751
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>

2957
02:32:14.751 --> 02:32:16.280
<v Speaker 4>it's not a drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just outlined.</v>

2958
02:32:16.310 --> 02:32:20.840
<v Speaker 4>That's the actual original clay tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they drew on as an outline,</v>

2959
02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:22.213
<v Speaker 4>but he's not amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could find the actual tablet </v>

2960
02:32:24.381 --> 02:32:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Jamie too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he and he can zoom in on it so you</v>

2961
02:32:26.721 --> 02:32:28.550
<v Speaker 4>could see it better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but really,</v>

2962
02:32:28.551 --> 02:32:31.250
<v Speaker 4>really incredible stuff when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>consider the fact that they,</v>

2963
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:34.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made this somewhere around,</v>

2964
02:32:35.140 --> 02:32:36.770
<v Speaker 4>what was his 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>BC?</v>

2965
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:38.000
<v Speaker 4>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>BC?</v>

2966
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:39.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was that one right there</v>

2967
02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:41.240
<v Speaker 3>was that early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's somewhere,</v>

2968
02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:42.530
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in that neighborhood.</v>

2969
02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:46.060
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find a better full </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of it.</v>

2970
02:32:46.061 --> 02:32:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2971
02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.620
<v Speaker 3>They're young Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2972
02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:49.993
<v Speaker 4>incredible stuff and weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean there are depictions of </v>

2973
02:32:53.121 --> 02:32:56.520
<v Speaker 4>people with tails sitting on the labs of</v>
<v Speaker 4>giants and</v>

2974
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.863
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tends to decode symbolically </v>

2975
02:33:01.650 --> 02:33:05.100
<v Speaker 3>actually those hybrid creature type </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2976
02:33:05.770 --> 02:33:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

2977
02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:07.711
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2978
02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:11.340
<v Speaker 3>most of those things I think should not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be taken literally.</v>

2979
02:33:11.370 --> 02:33:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2980
02:33:13.390 --> 02:33:15.180
<v Speaker 3>like you were talking about myths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2981
02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:20.190
<v Speaker 3>The myths because things change shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the one thing becomes another.</v>

2982
02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:25.580
<v Speaker 3>And when does a shung pictorially it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that it's to be taken.</v>

2983
02:33:26.011 --> 02:33:26.844
<v Speaker 3>Literally there's the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could see it there in the </v>

2984
02:33:28.771 --> 02:33:33.771
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty interesting stuff,</v>

2985
02:33:34.141 --> 02:33:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where,</v>

2986
02:33:36.091 --> 02:33:38.070
<v Speaker 3>where are they in the background?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>

2987
02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:39.850
<v Speaker 3>see right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2988
02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:41.613
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

2989
02:33:42.930 --> 02:33:44.640
<v Speaker 3>but the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the original.</v>

2990
02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:46.213
<v Speaker 3>You have the sun and the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stars actually that's a motif that </v>

2991
02:33:49.951 --> 02:33:52.440
<v Speaker 3>you see in Egypt often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really where you have,</v>

2992
02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:57.300
<v Speaker 3>where you have a star with the solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>disk and in,</v>

2993
02:33:57.301 --> 02:33:58.110
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2994
02:33:58.110 --> 02:34:02.910
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And often they're just stars.</v>

2995
02:34:02.911 --> 02:34:03.744
<v Speaker 3>That five points that stars and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's with the solar disk in it and what </v>

2996
02:34:08.131 --> 02:34:08.964
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the egyptologists talk about a </v>

2997
02:34:10.471 --> 02:34:15.320
<v Speaker 3>stellar cult and the solar cult and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you call anything to cult,</v>

2998
02:34:16.170 --> 02:34:17.740
<v Speaker 3>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes,</v>

2999
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else's religion,</v>

3000
02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:23.470
<v Speaker 1>therefore a superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

3001
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.660
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's talking about.</v>

3002
02:34:25.661 --> 02:34:27.820
<v Speaker 1>And probably this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3003
02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two levels.</v>

3004
02:34:29.111 --> 02:34:30.190
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

3005
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:32.470
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the solar sky,</v>

3006
02:34:32.471 --> 02:34:35.230
<v Speaker 1>our solar system and the star around it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3007
02:34:35.231 --> 02:34:39.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a diagonal sky is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellation Constellation in the sky.</v>

3008
02:34:39.731 --> 02:34:40.564
<v Speaker 1>So it's two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two levels of the hierarchy </v>

3009
02:34:43.091 --> 02:34:45.980
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

3010
02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:46.913
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just amazing that you're talking about </v>

3011
02:34:47.991 --> 02:34:49.550
<v Speaker 4>such a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time ago.</v>

3012
02:34:49.551 --> 02:34:51.080
<v Speaker 4>And they had all the little planets</v>

3013
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:53.760
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the,</v>

3014
02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:56.070
<v Speaker 1>well they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have your innocent,</v>

3015
02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:58.050
<v Speaker 1>they don't have urinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what they have there.</v>

3016
02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Do they pull it back up again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

3017
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm finding a couple of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions.</v>

3018
02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's more than one version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3019
02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:07.020
<v Speaker 1>One only had seven planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have another one that was nine.</v>

3020
02:35:07.021 --> 02:35:07.651
<v Speaker 1>It was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3021
02:35:07.651 --> 02:35:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have,</v>

3022
02:35:08.911 --> 02:35:09.990
<v Speaker 1>medicine only has seven.</v>

3023
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:11.283
<v Speaker 4>That was a different one where that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows a star and then it has a bunch of </v>

3024
02:35:13.691 --> 02:35:15.910
<v Speaker 4>plants off to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what that means.</v>

3025
02:35:15.911 --> 02:35:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Go full you on that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

3026
02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:19.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that one.</v>

3027
02:35:21.150 --> 02:35:24.840
<v Speaker 4>It's just so cool to look at something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that someone made,</v>

3028
02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:25.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

3029
02:35:25.891 --> 02:35:29.220
<v Speaker 4>five thousand six thousand years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 4>see there</v>

3030
02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:33.400
<v Speaker 1>dare attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that police there,</v>

3031
02:35:33.690 --> 02:35:35.640
<v Speaker 4>tamped at trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3032
02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:37.133
<v Speaker 4>show and convey what they knew about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world or what their thoughts were about </v>

3033
02:35:42.181 --> 02:35:43.460
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are we seeing</v>

3034
02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:45.700
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like war.</v>

3035
02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.970
<v Speaker 1>That one is not well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a common theme.</v>

3036
02:35:48.971 --> 02:35:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3037
02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a common theme in Egypt to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharaoh,</v>

3038
02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the Pharaoh smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling in the heads of the,</v>

3039
02:35:58.001 --> 02:36:00.700
<v Speaker 1>of his enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the conquest of the forces of light</v>

3040
02:36:00.701 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 1>over the forces of darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one,</v>

3041
02:36:03.101 --> 02:36:06.190
<v Speaker 1>the seven might not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

3042
02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:09.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that you have that,</v>

3043
02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:12.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said off often in Egypt or are very</v>

3044
02:36:12.461 --> 02:36:14.230
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other one,</v>

3045
02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:16.920
<v Speaker 1>the star and the seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seven planet,</v>

3046
02:36:16.930 --> 02:36:20.800
<v Speaker 1>it could be planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see it's a different looking star to</v>

3047
02:36:20.801 --> 02:36:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it's many one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different one.</v>

3048
02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:24.363
<v Speaker 1>The other one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

3049
02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:26.170
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>

3050
02:36:26.430 --> 02:36:30.310
<v Speaker 1>it might be a number symbolism thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the thing and the,</v>

3051
02:36:30.311 --> 02:36:31.144
<v Speaker 1>and the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians do seven not as circles like </v>

3052
02:36:35.411 --> 02:36:36.244
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as,</v>

3053
02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:37.690
<v Speaker 1>as as dots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3054
02:36:37.691 --> 02:36:38.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>

3055
02:36:38.531 --> 02:36:43.480
<v Speaker 1>it has a numerical validity rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily than an astronomical one.</v>

3056
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:46.030
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one and go back the other one,</v>

3057
02:36:46.031 --> 02:36:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3058
02:36:48.861 --> 02:36:49.694
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3059
02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:51.980
<v Speaker 1>that one's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one's really interesting.</v>

3060
02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this stuff is an interest.</v>

3061
02:36:55.361 --> 02:36:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relative sizes,</v>

3062
02:36:56.750 --> 02:36:59.150
<v Speaker 1>the relative sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty mind boggling.</v>

3063
02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3064
02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two on the,</v>

3065
02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:07.340
<v Speaker 1>on the outer edge is really those two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3066
02:37:07.730 --> 02:37:09.170
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

3067
02:37:09.530 --> 02:37:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting indeed.</v>

3068
02:37:11.691 --> 02:37:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that explained any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>way than,</v>

3069
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:16.370
<v Speaker 1>than uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew something.</v>

3070
02:37:17.410 --> 02:37:20.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or it's an amazing lucky.</v>

3071
02:37:20.151 --> 02:37:21.470
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3072
02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:24.680
<v Speaker 6>this is not guesswork.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3073
02:37:24.681 --> 02:37:28.970
<v Speaker 6>it's just a unraveling ancient </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>

3074
02:37:28.971 --> 02:37:31.250
<v Speaker 6>It's like putting together a puzzle when</v>
<v Speaker 6>you only have five,</v>

3075
02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:32.780
<v Speaker 6>six pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3076
02:37:32.781 --> 02:37:33.614
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the thing that when we started </v>

3077
02:37:35.031 --> 02:37:35.864
<v Speaker 6>out there were a few pieces and then now</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of pieces have been added to the </v>

3078
02:37:41.931 --> 02:37:42.650
<v Speaker 6>puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3079
02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:43.483
<v Speaker 6>But the nuclear glass,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the coronal mass ejection go back to </v>

3080
02:37:46.991 --> 02:37:50.670
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] is a big chunk of Gunung </v>
<v Speaker 6>Padang.</v>

3081
02:37:50.671 --> 02:37:51.890
<v Speaker 6>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3082
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:55.700
<v Speaker 6>Indonesia is another one that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have any photos.</v>

3083
02:37:55.710 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 6>Event with chalk has been to that and is</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely convinced that at very,</v>

3084
02:37:59.751 --> 02:38:04.040
<v Speaker 6>very low aa that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it's human made and that it's very,</v>

3085
02:38:04.041 --> 02:38:06.890
<v Speaker 6>very old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These things are showing up all over the</v>

3086
02:38:06.891 --> 02:38:09.200
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So go back to this slides and,</v>

3087
02:38:09.201 --> 02:38:10.550
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

3088
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:15.170
<v Speaker 6>it's such an emerging thing as far as </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3089
02:38:15.171 --> 02:38:17.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people talking about it to the slides.</v>

3090
02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:21.230
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is something that's being discussed</v>

3091
02:38:21.231 --> 02:38:23.900
<v Speaker 6>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now it's much more mainstream.</v>

3092
02:38:23.901 --> 02:38:24.734
<v Speaker 6>And now that Graham Hancock has got a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of traction on his work and his new </v>

3093
02:38:28.161 --> 02:38:28.994
<v Speaker 6>book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>magicians of the Gods and Randall </v>

3094
02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:34.220
<v Speaker 6>Carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's an expert on asteroidal impacts,</v>

3095
02:38:34.221 --> 02:38:36.590
<v Speaker 6>has sort of impacted his work as well </v>
<v Speaker 6>and really,</v>

3096
02:38:36.610 --> 02:38:37.600
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3097
02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:39.290
<v Speaker 6>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3098
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:44.480
<v Speaker 6>made it more interesting because he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>provided a context with some historical,</v>

3099
02:38:44.810 --> 02:38:45.643
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like actual scientific evidence of </v>

3100
02:38:47.931 --> 02:38:48.860
<v Speaker 6>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3101
02:38:48.861 --> 02:38:49.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3102
02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:50.300
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go along with it.</v>

3103
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:52.460
<v Speaker 6>So what are we looking at here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

3104
02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.690
<v Speaker 6>that's called Beckley tip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

3105
02:38:53.691 --> 02:38:54.450
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

3106
02:38:54.450 --> 02:38:55.610
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3107
02:38:55.810 --> 02:38:57.130
<v Speaker 6>that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Might go back to these heavy,</v>

3108
02:38:57.131 --> 02:38:57.964
<v Speaker 6>that's not the Playa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's one of shocks when a shuck </v>

3109
02:39:00.771 --> 02:39:02.660
<v Speaker 6>slides I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not sure what he's,</v>

3110
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:07.580
<v Speaker 6>what he's driving at there in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>background.</v>

3111
02:39:07.610 --> 02:39:08.443
<v Speaker 6>That's Brophy's I think that's brophy's </v>
<v Speaker 6>slides of where he's looking for much </v>

3112
02:39:12.201 --> 02:39:15.850
<v Speaker 6>more sophisticated information in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

3113
02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:17.180
<v Speaker 6>in the Playa.</v>

3114
02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:21.270
<v Speaker 6>And even if he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if it's more far out speculations,</v>

3115
02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:25.370
<v Speaker 6>I just speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they could be just the basic,</v>

3116
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:28.160
<v Speaker 6>the basic premise is already,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3117
02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:31.010
<v Speaker 6>of great significance that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3118
02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:33.410
<v Speaker 6>that this is cause this is dated to </v>
<v Speaker 6>five,</v>

3119
02:39:33.411 --> 02:39:34.610
<v Speaker 6>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>BC.</v>

3120
02:39:34.970 --> 02:39:37.520
<v Speaker 6>So that makes it the oldest datable </v>
<v Speaker 6>stone circle.</v>

3121
02:39:37.970 --> 02:39:38.803
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things I was going to bring </v>

3122
02:39:39.201 --> 02:39:40.034
<v Speaker 6>up with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forgot when we were talking earlier </v>

3123
02:39:40.821 --> 02:39:41.960
<v Speaker 6>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3124
02:39:41.961 --> 02:39:44.890
<v Speaker 6>idea of the procession of equinox is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3125
02:39:44.930 --> 02:39:45.763
<v Speaker 6>the wobble of the earth being caused </v>
<v Speaker 6>perhaps by a dwarf star that we don't </v>

3126
02:39:49.101 --> 02:39:50.900
<v Speaker 6>know exactly where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3127
02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:51.933
<v Speaker 6>that was one of the theories about </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is outside of the Kuyper </v>

3128
02:39:56.211 --> 02:39:57.860
<v Speaker 6>belt that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3129
02:39:57.890 --> 02:40:02.890
<v Speaker 6>there's this object out there now that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're 90% plus sure exists and they're</v>

3130
02:40:03.441 --> 02:40:04.220
<v Speaker 6>calling it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3131
02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:08.120
<v Speaker 6>planted acts or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They think that it's at least four times</v>

3132
02:40:08.121 --> 02:40:12.350
<v Speaker 6>larger than the earth and it's some </v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere outside of the Kuyper belt,</v>

3133
02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:14.970
<v Speaker 6>which is now what they believe Pluto is </v>
<v Speaker 6>a part of.</v>

3134
02:40:14.970 --> 02:40:15.803
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pluto when it,</v>

3135
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:18.030
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when Pluto is no longer a planet,</v>

3136
02:40:18.031 --> 02:40:22.860
<v Speaker 6>it got listed as an asteroidal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pluto downgraded got the shaft,</v>

3137
02:40:23.170 --> 02:40:24.600
<v Speaker 6>but they think there's something out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

3138
02:40:24.601 --> 02:40:25.434
<v Speaker 6>And one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the theories that I had read was </v>

3139
02:40:28.621 --> 02:40:32.340
<v Speaker 6>that it could be some sort of a dwarf </v>
<v Speaker 6>star that is a,</v>

3140
02:40:32.341 --> 02:40:35.430
<v Speaker 6>that exists so far out there that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't see it.</v>

3141
02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:36.900
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well the brown door,</v>

3142
02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:39.850
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>walter cutting didn't,</v>

3143
02:40:39.851 --> 02:40:43.050
<v Speaker 6>who runs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who started sea pack would be,</v>

3144
02:40:43.051 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He knows about that.</v>

3145
02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:45.273
<v Speaker 6>I'll be seeing him in a few days and </v>
<v Speaker 6>some interesting stuff going on at seed </v>

3146
02:40:48.891 --> 02:40:49.800
<v Speaker 6>packets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's strange.</v>

3147
02:40:49.801 --> 02:40:52.880
<v Speaker 6>You didn't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well you know about the planet that they</v>

3148
02:40:52.930 --> 02:40:53.940
<v Speaker 6>were pretty sure of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3149
02:40:55.130 --> 02:40:56.640
<v Speaker 6>Do you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3150
02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:58.410
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's see if he could find that.</v>

3151
02:40:58.411 --> 02:40:59.244
<v Speaker 6>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they think that somewhere outside of </v>

3152
02:41:01.081 --> 02:41:05.670
<v Speaker 6>Pluto that there is a large body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't know what it is.</v>

3153
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:06.503
<v Speaker 6>They don't know exactly how big it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they think it's far larger than the </v>

3154
02:41:08.341 --> 02:41:09.300
<v Speaker 6>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3155
02:41:09.390 --> 02:41:11.310
<v Speaker 6>at least four times larger than the </v>
<v Speaker 6>earth.</v>

3156
02:41:12.270 --> 02:41:13.103
<v Speaker 6>And that it exists and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's gravitational effect is having a </v>

3157
02:41:16.921 --> 02:41:17.754
<v Speaker 6>response here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is new dwarf planet discovered far </v>

3158
02:41:20.251 --> 02:41:21.690
<v Speaker 6>beyond Pluto's or no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

3159
02:41:21.691 --> 02:41:24.120
<v Speaker 6>That's not it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a different,</v>

3160
02:41:24.121 --> 02:41:27.450
<v Speaker 6>that's a dwarf planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is something that's much larger.</v>

3161
02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:30.120
<v Speaker 6>This is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they think it's larger than earth.</v>

3162
02:41:30.121 --> 02:41:30.954
<v Speaker 6>Lou just look up planet four times </v>
<v Speaker 6>larger than Earth believe to be outside </v>

3163
02:41:35.281 --> 02:41:36.114
<v Speaker 6>of the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They think it's a part of the solar </v>

3164
02:41:37.711 --> 02:41:40.410
<v Speaker 6>system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's on this gigantic orgo like way,</v>

3165
02:41:40.411 --> 02:41:41.520
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>way out there.</v>

3166
02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:45.810
<v Speaker 6>So most of them are binary star systems,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3167
02:41:45.811 --> 02:41:46.920
<v Speaker 6>Most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think so.</v>

3168
02:41:46.921 --> 02:41:49.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shock would know that.</v>

3169
02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:51.840
<v Speaker 6>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is astronomy a lot better than I do.</v>

3170
02:41:52.470 --> 02:41:53.303
<v Speaker 6>But it's interesting if there is some </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a star or a dead star out there </v>

3171
02:41:57.990 --> 02:41:59.850
<v Speaker 6>way out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3172
02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:03.030
<v Speaker 6>And then it's affecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's causing our earth to wobble.</v>

3173
02:42:03.450 --> 02:42:04.290
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3174
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.390
<v Speaker 6>I mean here it is as Toronto merce say a</v>
<v Speaker 6>nap.</v>

3175
02:42:09.430 --> 02:42:10.241
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3176
02:42:10.241 --> 02:42:10.531
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3177
02:42:10.531 --> 02:42:10.980
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nope.</v>

3178
02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:11.731
<v Speaker 6>Do Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Does that.</v>

3179
02:42:11.731 --> 02:42:13.800
<v Speaker 6>It looks bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that it?</v>

3180
02:42:14.530 --> 02:42:15.540
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Neptune's big.</v>

3181
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:19.080
<v Speaker 6>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be hit January 20th yeah.</v>

3182
02:42:19.081 --> 02:42:19.914
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

3183
02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:22.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't see that one.</v>

3184
02:42:22.530 --> 02:42:23.363
<v Speaker 6>The claim is the strongest yet in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>century's long search for planet x </v>

3185
02:42:26.101 --> 02:42:26.934
<v Speaker 6>beyond Neptune nuquest has been plagued </v>
<v Speaker 6>by far fetched claims and even outright </v>

3186
02:42:30.721 --> 02:42:31.554
<v Speaker 6>quackery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the new evidence comes from a pair </v>

3187
02:42:33.961 --> 02:42:36.090
<v Speaker 6>of respected planetary scientists.</v>

3188
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:38.160
<v Speaker 6>I want to say that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the language,</v>

3189
02:42:38.370 --> 02:42:41.610
<v Speaker 6>look at the language yet it's quackery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they don't agree,</v>

3190
02:42:41.611 --> 02:42:44.550
<v Speaker 6>and if it's not one of their own,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if it's one of their own,</v>

3191
02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:48.500
<v Speaker 6>it's respected until somebody comes </v>
<v Speaker 6>along and shows that they're wrong.</v>

3192
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:49.463
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But their language is tempered by guys </v>

3193
02:42:50.911 --> 02:42:52.710
<v Speaker 6>like Zacharias H isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3194
02:42:52.711 --> 02:42:54.300
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he brings it on himself.</v>

3195
02:42:54.301 --> 02:42:55.134
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3196
02:42:55.170 --> 02:42:56.850
<v Speaker 6>But some of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3197
02:42:56.890 --> 02:42:58.020
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's equal.</v>

3198
02:42:58.021 --> 02:42:58.854
<v Speaker 6>That's why I call them the core </v>
<v Speaker 6>academics because every week there's </v>

3199
02:43:01.711 --> 02:43:02.544
<v Speaker 6>something coming along this proving </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff that they'd been insisting has </v>

3200
02:43:05.371 --> 02:43:08.400
<v Speaker 6>been right for the last 10 or 15 or 20 </v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

3201
02:43:08.490 --> 02:43:10.500
<v Speaker 6>Look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they're never quacks.</v>

3202
02:43:10.530 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 6>They think it orbits the sun every</v>

3203
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:13.450
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3204
02:43:13.810 --> 02:43:14.643
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3205
02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3206
02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:18.760
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

3207
02:43:18.761 --> 02:43:21.670
<v Speaker 3>it's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know so much,</v>

3208
02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:25.120
<v Speaker 3>but so little at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3209
02:43:25.121 --> 02:43:26.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Dennis.</v>

3210
02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:26.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Mckenna had this great saying </v>

3211
02:43:27.911 --> 02:43:31.110
<v Speaker 3>that when the bonfire of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3212
02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they work,</v>

3213
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:34.063
<v Speaker 3>a bonfire of understanding grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it illuminates the surface area of </v>

3214
02:43:38.711 --> 02:43:39.990
<v Speaker 3>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3215
02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:41.100
<v Speaker 3>good line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3216
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:44.080
<v Speaker 3>That you realize like the brighter the </v>
<v Speaker 3>light,</v>

3217
02:43:44.290 --> 02:43:44.981
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3218
02:43:44.981 --> 02:43:46.990
<v Speaker 3>there's so much you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all the,</v>

3219
02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you have to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and understanding.</v>

3220
02:43:50.770 --> 02:43:54.010
<v Speaker 3>The example with the crack epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptologists they,</v>

3221
02:43:54.490 --> 02:43:55.323
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of facts that it's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>well so that they do not understand at </v>

3222
02:43:58.451 --> 02:43:59.650
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

3223
02:43:59.651 --> 02:44:00.484
<v Speaker 3>I mean my own work schwaller is on work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't have been done without all of </v>

3224
02:44:04.331 --> 02:44:09.331
<v Speaker 3>that careful factual work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let the Egyptologist and what I do,</v>

3225
02:44:09.441 --> 02:44:10.274
<v Speaker 3>who would we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean those of us who are looking into </v>

3226
02:44:11.891 --> 02:44:12.724
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take that factual material and </v>

3227
02:44:14.291 --> 02:44:15.124
<v Speaker 3>Schwaller rise it and that gives us a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain degree of understanding those </v>

3228
02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Derek stone to have it all those jerks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back to the slides.</v>

3229
02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:25.810
<v Speaker 3>What else you got here that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show us?</v>

3230
02:44:26.050 --> 02:44:26.883
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a lot but some stuff I want to </v>

3231
02:44:28.151 --> 02:44:29.140
<v Speaker 3>skip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3232
02:44:29.141 --> 02:44:29.974
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to skip stuff now cause I'm </v>

3233
02:44:31.631 --> 02:44:33.760
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm running out of words,</v>

3234
02:44:33.761 --> 02:44:34.950
<v Speaker 3>which is hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the,</v>

3235
02:44:34.970 --> 02:44:39.370
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those very hard stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>vase,</v>

3236
02:44:39.890 --> 02:44:40.723
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this thin lip and the walls of the </v>

3237
02:44:42.431 --> 02:44:45.190
<v Speaker 3>vas are about as thick as the rim of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lip.</v>

3238
02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:48.130
<v Speaker 3>And this is all made out of one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

3239
02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:49.053
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of a very hard stone cold green </v>

3240
02:44:51.221 --> 02:44:52.054
<v Speaker 3>shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we think actually shocking myself </v>

3241
02:44:54.430 --> 02:44:56.920
<v Speaker 3>and as an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had another friend of mine,</v>

3242
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.823
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good writer named Paul William </v>

3243
02:44:59.140 --> 02:45:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Roberts was his suggestion that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe these stone thinks it's,</v>

3244
02:45:03.241 --> 02:45:04.074
<v Speaker 3>it'll quite a few of them date from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier period and had were kept as </v>

3245
02:45:08.981 --> 02:45:11.500
<v Speaker 3>sacred objects all of those years.</v>

3246
02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:15.730
<v Speaker 3>And of course if they were kept in </v>
<v Speaker 3>guarded and not broken and a hammer,</v>

3247
02:45:15.740 --> 02:45:19.750
<v Speaker 3>brexit but were kept in touch in in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece,</v>

3248
02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:22.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>x number of thousand years that wouldn't</v>

3249
02:45:22.571 --> 02:45:23.404
<v Speaker 3>be weathered or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be fine as long as they were </v>

3250
02:45:25.391 --> 02:45:26.224
<v Speaker 3>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now is there any speculation whatsoever </v>

3251
02:45:29.021 --> 02:45:32.340
<v Speaker 3>as to the method that they use to create</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like this?</v>

3252
02:45:32.350 --> 02:45:33.183
<v Speaker 3>Some stupid ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's hear the stupid ones so that </v>

3253
02:45:36.250 --> 02:45:37.083
<v Speaker 3>they're shown with bow drills that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that the way like you light a fire </v>

3254
02:45:41.981 --> 02:45:42.814
<v Speaker 3>with sticks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a kind of a drill that they </v>

3255
02:45:45.611 --> 02:45:48.820
<v Speaker 3>put in there with bulls of some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3256
02:45:48.821 --> 02:45:53.590
<v Speaker 3>hard stone and once you get the drill </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing down you can kind of work your way</v>

3257
02:45:53.591 --> 02:45:55.840
<v Speaker 3>around and gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gradually,</v>

3258
02:45:55.841 --> 02:45:56.674
<v Speaker 3>gradually hollow out the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This seems insane to me and that it </v>

3259
02:46:03.251 --> 02:46:04.430
<v Speaker 3>would take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3260
02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:05.313
<v Speaker 3>one of those guys should devote his life</v>
<v Speaker 3>to taking a block of green schist and </v>

3261
02:46:09.321 --> 02:46:13.340
<v Speaker 3>trying that method and see how far he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets in 10 or 15 years.</v>

3262
02:46:13.341 --> 02:46:17.660
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to imagine that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do that with a method like that,</v>

3263
02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:21.540
<v Speaker 4>but it's otherwise no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that like sort of a,</v>

3264
02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:22.493
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't balance out with the insanity</v>
<v Speaker 4>of building a pyramid in the first </v>

3265
02:46:25.321 --> 02:46:26.154
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

3266
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3267
02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:28.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>building a pyramid,</v>

3268
02:46:28.171 --> 02:46:29.004
<v Speaker 4>it's just incredible undertaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they say that like if you cut in </v>

3269
02:46:31.291 --> 02:46:34.470
<v Speaker 4>place 10 songs a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would take you 664 years.</v>

3270
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:36.320
<v Speaker 4>It is mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3271
02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:37.290
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3272
02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:38.153
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

3273
02:46:38.570 --> 02:46:42.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite clear that they did it.</v>

3274
02:46:42.171 --> 02:46:43.004
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not at all clear that they did it </v>

3275
02:46:44.301 --> 02:46:48.200
<v Speaker 3>in the allotted 25 years as something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of why they did it.</v>

3276
02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:48.951
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3277
02:46:48.951 --> 02:46:49.784
<v Speaker 3>does he do it to an academic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only possible explanation is that </v>

3278
02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:54.913
<v Speaker 3>they were tombs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though there's no evidence </v>

3279
02:46:55.821 --> 02:46:58.700
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever that they were tombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they say they were tombs,</v>

3280
02:46:58.701 --> 02:47:00.170
<v Speaker 3>they don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think they were?</v>

3281
02:47:00.650 --> 02:47:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know except what I'm pretty sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they weren't tombs in the,</v>

3282
02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:07.420
<v Speaker 3>and they weren't tunes only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

3283
02:47:07.450 --> 02:47:12.450
<v Speaker 3>my gentle sense of it is that since </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and Egypt has as its focus,</v>

3284
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.600
<v Speaker 3>the quest for immortality in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form,</v>

3285
02:47:18.650 --> 02:47:19.483
<v Speaker 3>they enhance that quest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make it possible to do things that </v>

3286
02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:26.080
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't otherwise do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you,</v>

3287
02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:28.220
<v Speaker 3>you've got enough people together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>come on a trip,</v>

3288
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll come on your own and we do our two </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour meditation in the pyramid.</v>

3289
02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:37.400
<v Speaker 3>You come out of there and knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you not been just in a quiet bathroom,</v>

3290
02:47:37.850 --> 02:47:38.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3291
02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:42.950
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this place surges with power.</v>

3292
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 3>You've got a group of people in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of whom are,</v>

3293
02:47:45.470 --> 02:47:48.710
<v Speaker 3>especially if are some whoever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice of meditation,</v>

3294
02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:51.200
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

3295
02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:56.410
<v Speaker 3>it's something and I mean you come out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of there knowing that you've experienced</v>

3296
02:47:58.281 --> 02:48:00.170
<v Speaker 3>something that you've not experienced </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3297
02:48:00.530 --> 02:48:04.610
<v Speaker 3>So how they were used and to what end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3298
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:05.743
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a quite common theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there were sites of high </v>

3299
02:48:09.081 --> 02:48:09.914
<v Speaker 3>initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there are sites of high initiation </v>

3300
02:48:12.141 --> 02:48:14.420
<v Speaker 3>and when you understand what initiation </v>
<v Speaker 3>involves,</v>

3301
02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:17.300
<v Speaker 3>that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a dumb theory.</v>

3302
02:48:17.301 --> 02:48:18.134
<v Speaker 3>It is a dumb theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't think there's such a thing </v>

3303
02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:21.313
<v Speaker 3>as initiation and if you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>illumination is dependent upon </v>

3304
02:48:24.501 --> 02:48:25.334
<v Speaker 3>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're not be able to think of </v>

3305
02:48:27.561 --> 02:48:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if,</v>

3306
02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:34.580
<v Speaker 3>if you've been to the Po to the places </v>
<v Speaker 3>and have experienced it yourself,</v>

3307
02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:36.013
<v Speaker 3>the power of these places then exploit </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanations of that sort even though </v>

3308
02:48:38.931 --> 02:48:40.160
<v Speaker 3>they don't count as</v>

3309
02:48:42.090 --> 02:48:45.520
<v Speaker 4>speculative for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you don't have any evidence for</v>

3310
02:48:45.521 --> 02:48:47.840
<v Speaker 4>them being tombs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty speculative to right.</v>

3311
02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:51.360
<v Speaker 4>And building them is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beyond belief.</v>

3312
02:48:51.450 --> 02:48:54.180
<v Speaker 4>Lighting them up is only slightly less </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>

3313
02:48:54.210 --> 02:48:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the whole thing.</v>

3314
02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:58.770
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any theories at all is how </v>
<v Speaker 4>they could build some sort of a stone?</v>

3315
02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:00.353
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3316
02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty incredible stuff.</v>

3317
02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:05.840
<v Speaker 3>But let's go up cause we got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I don't want to take her.</v>

3318
02:49:06.210 --> 02:49:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's us.</v>

3319
02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:10.500
<v Speaker 3>My criminal partner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boris swinging the digital sledge hammer</v>

3320
02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:11.903
<v Speaker 3>looking for underground caverns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what did you hit that thing and it </v>

3321
02:49:15.121 --> 02:49:19.140
<v Speaker 3>makes us sound and this sound </v>
<v Speaker 3>seismograph two goes into the earth.</v>

3322
02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:20.003
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next slide is what we found and </v>

3323
02:49:22.081 --> 02:49:24.520
<v Speaker 3>there it has the Aa that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

3324
02:49:24.610 --> 02:49:27.780
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a cavern or a chamber or of some</v>

3325
02:49:27.781 --> 02:49:28.614
<v Speaker 3>sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a void underneath the bedrock and </v>

3326
02:49:31.591 --> 02:49:32.424
<v Speaker 3>that's the so called hall of records.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think that that's Edgar Casey is </v>

3327
02:49:35.701 --> 02:49:38.190
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're iffy about it.</v>

3328
02:49:38.191 --> 02:49:39.024
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seismograph does not know how to </v>

3329
02:49:41.671 --> 02:49:42.504
<v Speaker 3>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just says what's there and it </v>

3330
02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:48.750
<v Speaker 3>knows there's a void and at the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>back it's a little bit,</v>

3331
02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:49.793
<v Speaker 3>you don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the edge of the CC at the very end </v>

3332
02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:55.410
<v Speaker 3>by the rump that is also a chamber and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's absolutely,</v>

3333
02:49:55.411 --> 02:49:56.244
<v Speaker 3>it's known that it's there and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you the same profile sizemore </v>

3334
02:49:58.840 --> 02:49:59.673
<v Speaker 3>logically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no seismograph Bentley's </v>

3335
02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:01.690
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3336
02:50:01.690 --> 02:50:02.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back one,</v>

3337
02:50:02.501 --> 02:50:03.334
<v Speaker 3>there's a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very rough cut chamber and </v>

3338
02:50:05.131 --> 02:50:05.964
<v Speaker 3>there's a just behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those stones because if you pull </v>

3339
02:50:07.561 --> 02:50:11.190
<v Speaker 3>it away and you can get in and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>room rough,</v>

3340
02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:12.053
<v Speaker 3>it's very rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But about the size of the room that </v>

3341
02:50:13.171 --> 02:50:15.540
<v Speaker 3>we're in here at the studio and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

3342
02:50:15.541 --> 02:50:16.374
<v Speaker 3>So if that's a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it stands to reason that seismic </v>

3343
02:50:19.471 --> 02:50:23.220
<v Speaker 3>graphical reason anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a is also a,</v>

3344
02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:27.570
<v Speaker 3>a cavern or a grotto or construction or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3345
02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:30.960
<v Speaker 3>So what we're looking at with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see all those circles around it</v>

3346
02:50:30.961 --> 02:50:32.640
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rough shape of it,</v>

3347
02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:34.830
<v Speaker 3>that's the shape that they believe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room is.</v>

3348
02:50:34.831 --> 02:50:35.664
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be similar to the one that's at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ramp where it would be like kind of </v>

3349
02:50:38.131 --> 02:50:39.410
<v Speaker 3>a rod meld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3350
02:50:39.411 --> 02:50:40.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seismic graphic,</v>

3351
02:50:40.981 --> 02:50:41.814
<v Speaker 3>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the top of the lines of </v>

3352
02:50:43.871 --> 02:50:47.160
<v Speaker 3>something that gives you the depths of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is that,</v>

3353
02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:50.640
<v Speaker 3>and but it's not like a square 90 degree</v>
<v Speaker 3>angle.</v>

3354
02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:54.320
<v Speaker 3>It's roughly rectangular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Says Tom,</v>

3355
02:50:54.470 --> 02:50:55.303
<v Speaker 3>Tom Dubecky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is our Geo Geo physicist who was </v>

3356
02:50:57.331 --> 02:50:58.164
<v Speaker 3>doing that work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the hold up as far as </v>

3357
02:50:59.341 --> 02:51:01.230
<v Speaker 3>examining that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3358
02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:05.730
<v Speaker 3>two one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to be wrong to that.</v>

3359
02:51:05.731 --> 02:51:08.100
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's under about five.</v>

3360
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:10.280
<v Speaker 3>The about 15 feet of bedrock that </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't,</v>

3361
02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:15.480
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the the most,</v>

3362
02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:19.950
<v Speaker 3>let's say that the archeological hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>spot of the universe.</v>

3363
02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:24.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean nothing is more open to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3364
02:51:24.970 --> 02:51:27.790
<v Speaker 3>excitement and all the rest of it is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>swinks.</v>

3365
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:30.383
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water level has risen so that that </v>

3366
02:51:33.330 --> 02:51:36.390
<v Speaker 3>whole chamber is probably filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>water now.</v>

3367
02:51:36.391 --> 02:51:41.090
<v Speaker 3>So anything that isn't stone would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been obliterated long ago when I was at,</v>

3368
02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:43.230
<v Speaker 3>he got down there and you're found with </v>
<v Speaker 3>wet scrolls,</v>

3369
02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:46.250
<v Speaker 3>well maybe or or stone something or in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3370
02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:47.513
<v Speaker 3>but in theory you could put a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber optic something down there and </v>

3371
02:51:50.491 --> 02:51:51.324
<v Speaker 3>study it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to be wrong about </v>

3372
02:51:53.551 --> 02:51:55.500
<v Speaker 3>this and anything invasive.</v>

3373
02:51:56.100 --> 02:51:59.160
<v Speaker 3>The Sphinx is really in disastrous </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>

3374
02:51:59.161 --> 02:52:02.250
<v Speaker 3>So any little vibration or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that could,</v>

3375
02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could could conceivably damage it.</v>

3376
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.903
<v Speaker 3>I don't worry about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The geology is much more important as </v>

3377
02:52:09.941 --> 02:52:10.774
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my guess is that when we finally </v>

3378
02:52:13.361 --> 02:52:17.020
<v Speaker 3>break open the port colors and capture </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the,</v>

3379
02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:19.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the capture,</v>

3380
02:52:19.571 --> 02:52:20.840
<v Speaker 3>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3381
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:22.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the core academics that,</v>

3382
02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:24.250
<v Speaker 3>that it protects it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment,</v>

3383
02:52:24.730 --> 02:52:28.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I dunno,</v>

3384
02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:30.310
<v Speaker 3>maybe we'll waterboard them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

3385
02:52:30.330 --> 02:52:31.163
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we capture all of the academics and get </v>

3386
02:52:33.131 --> 02:52:36.250
<v Speaker 3>them the hell out of there at that point</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it gets,</v>

3387
02:52:36.730 --> 02:52:37.563
<v Speaker 3>when it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it is accepted and these things do </v>

3388
02:52:39.881 --> 02:52:42.340
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is idea whose time has come,</v>

3389
02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:44.770
<v Speaker 3>when it has come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things change.</v>

3390
02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:49.000
<v Speaker 3>And at that point maybe then the funding</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows up and the,</v>

3391
02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:49.953
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the determination comes up to </v>

3392
02:52:53.081 --> 02:52:58.081
<v Speaker 3>actually look into that void or chamber </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see if it is indeed avoid or chamber</v>

3393
02:52:58.091 --> 02:52:58.924
<v Speaker 3>and if there's something in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that there's some other </v>

3394
02:53:00.941 --> 02:53:02.910
<v Speaker 3>things in Egypt that haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered yet?</v>

3395
02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.410
<v Speaker 3>Load,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though where they are a lot of them</v>

3396
02:53:05.411 --> 02:53:06.430
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3397
02:53:06.431 --> 02:53:09.020
<v Speaker 3>but what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Landsat,</v>

3398
02:53:09.330 --> 02:53:11.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infrared.</v>

3399
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:12.783
<v Speaker 3>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you can photograph </v>

3400
02:53:13.390 --> 02:53:14.950
<v Speaker 3>underground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>

3401
02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:15.311
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3402
02:53:15.311 --> 02:53:16.144
<v Speaker 3>there are hundreds of sites that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know where their graves and tombs and </v>

3403
02:53:19.181 --> 02:53:21.310
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of them,</v>

3404
02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:24.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that kind of photography,</v>

3405
02:53:24.581 --> 02:53:25.414
<v Speaker 3>I thought there's a name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that kind of photography </v>

3406
02:53:28.151 --> 02:53:32.650
<v Speaker 3>goes deep enough from for us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>establish the,</v>

3407
02:53:32.690 --> 02:53:36.190
<v Speaker 3>the lost civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be under the sand level.</v>

3408
02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:37.053
<v Speaker 3>It'll be at the bottom of the sand level</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so far at any rate it doesn't get </v>

3409
02:53:40.241 --> 02:53:42.790
<v Speaker 3>down that deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have lots of places to excavate</v>

3410
02:53:42.791 --> 02:53:43.624
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The money.</v>

3411
02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep going here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going.</v>

3412
02:53:48.160 --> 02:53:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is now,</v>

3413
02:53:49.151 --> 02:53:52.480
<v Speaker 3>this is chuck's book and he'll be at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Seapak.</v>

3414
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:54.640
<v Speaker 3>This is a recent book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his last book.</v>

3415
02:53:54.641 --> 02:53:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a recent book.</v>

3416
02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:56.673
<v Speaker 3>The role of solar outbursts in our past </v>
<v Speaker 3>and future for gotten civilizations of </v>

3417
02:54:00.611 --> 02:54:01.330
<v Speaker 3>title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3418
02:54:01.330 --> 02:54:02.590
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting.</v>

3419
02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Very interesting thesis and backed up by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot by,</v>

3420
02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:08.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of solid,</v>

3421
02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:11.500
<v Speaker 3>a lot of solid scholarship and chocolate</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be at the seat pack.</v>

3422
02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:14.890
<v Speaker 3>This particular seat back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he thinks it was a,</v>

3423
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:15.783
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sore outburst more than they think it </v>

3424
02:54:18.701 --> 02:54:21.130
<v Speaker 3>was an asteroidal impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks,</v>

3425
02:54:21.131 --> 02:54:24.130
<v Speaker 3>although they're not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>antithetical the dates,</v>

3426
02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:25.560
<v Speaker 3>the dates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

3427
02:54:25.561 --> 02:54:27.280
<v Speaker 3>it could have been either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3428
02:54:27.281 --> 02:54:28.114
<v Speaker 3>shock shock thinks that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an impact in the earlier catastrophe </v>

3429
02:54:34.481 --> 02:54:37.290
<v Speaker 3>that brings on the younger dryas that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

3430
02:54:37.291 --> 02:54:38.124
<v Speaker 3>the intensification of the Ice Age and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks that it's the solar outburst </v>

3431
02:54:42.490 --> 02:54:46.840
<v Speaker 3>that that puts an end to the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and melts all the ice.</v>

3432
02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3433
02:54:51.410 --> 02:54:53.180
<v Speaker 3>A northern lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else we got?</v>

3434
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:54.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd keep going.</v>

3435
02:54:54.491 --> 02:54:55.324
<v Speaker 3>Does this go whisk by here because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is Anthony [inaudible] who was a </v>

3436
02:54:57.881 --> 02:54:59.930
<v Speaker 3>physicist at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's his thing.</v>

3437
02:54:59.931 --> 02:55:00.764
<v Speaker 3>Then here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are these figures that show up in </v>

3438
02:55:03.951 --> 02:55:04.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3439
02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:05.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3440
02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:08.990
<v Speaker 1>in the electro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the electron microscope and that</v>

3441
02:55:08.991 --> 02:55:09.824
<v Speaker 1>are mirrored by those strange dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>multi-headed multi-armed figures at the </v>

3442
02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:19.610
<v Speaker 1>petroglyphs at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually at the upper registers of those,</v>

3443
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:24.910
<v Speaker 1>of the petroglyph facade facade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also mirrors,</v>

3444
02:55:26.001 --> 02:55:27.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the wrong go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go scripture.</v>

3445
02:55:27.730 --> 02:55:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Aftershock is fascinated by the so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>untranslatable Rango rango script.</v>

3446
02:55:32.850 --> 02:55:37.850
<v Speaker 1>We're aside from Easter island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows as as letters,</v>

3447
02:55:38.091 --> 02:55:43.091
<v Speaker 1>presumably those kinds of weird humanoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

3448
02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:49.940
<v Speaker 1>One of the great mysteries of linguists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Yeah Huh?</v>

3449
02:55:50.650 --> 02:55:51.483
<v Speaker 1>Chro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Qigong as at the bottom of the whole </v>

3450
02:55:55.371 --> 02:55:57.190
<v Speaker 1>thing of my whole show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3451
02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Really with a whole bunch of other stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted on it.</v>

3452
02:56:01.340 --> 02:56:01.791
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3453
02:56:01.791 --> 02:56:03.980
<v Speaker 1>some stuff I didn't want I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whisk through,</v>

3454
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:05.203
<v Speaker 1>but what was up there that maybe I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to you is the map of them fuck </v>

3455
02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:13.040
<v Speaker 1>stan of greater and Lesser Dumbfuckistan</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

3456
02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:18.340
<v Speaker 1>which is very useful and my five cowboys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the graphic of the five cowboys</v>

3457
02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:23.300
<v Speaker 1>jury graphic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My stepson found it somewhere online,</v>

3458
02:56:23.690 --> 02:56:27.080
<v Speaker 1>but it really shows the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cowboys and action,</v>

3459
02:56:27.770 --> 02:56:28.910
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

3460
02:56:28.911 --> 02:56:29.744
<v Speaker 1>you pick up the pickup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily newspaper or turn on the </v>

3461
02:56:32.571 --> 02:56:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Internet and just see the cowboys at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

3462
02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:37.770
<v Speaker 1>You've been at this for a long time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3463
02:56:39.050 --> 02:56:42.750
<v Speaker 1>late sixties [inaudible] I was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3464
02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 67 well that's a around </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's around the time I came across.</v>

3465
02:56:50.841 --> 02:56:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Schwaller deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3466
02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:53.743
<v Speaker 1>Around them.</v>

3467
02:56:53.930 --> 02:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like people are slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 2>surely starting to come around at these,</v>

3468
02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:00.933
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concepts of these ancient </v>

3469
02:57:01.491 --> 02:57:06.140
<v Speaker 2>civilizations being not the primitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that we've been told,</v>

3470
02:57:06.141 --> 02:57:08.540
<v Speaker 2>but maybe perhaps just really complex?</v>

3471
02:57:08.590 --> 02:57:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of people,</v>

3472
02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the trouble is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

3473
02:57:12.991 --> 02:57:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture is muddied.</v>

3474
02:57:15.130 --> 02:57:15.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean the academics there as almost as </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics errors staunches ever in </v>

3475
02:57:19.781 --> 02:57:21.160
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their delusion.</v>

3476
02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.090
<v Speaker 1>But the trouble is that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario is,</v>

3477
02:57:25.540 --> 02:57:30.540
<v Speaker 1>is muddied and it's almost unavoidable </v>
<v Speaker 1>by ancient aliens in Zechariah said Chin</v>

3478
02:57:30.761 --> 02:57:31.594
<v Speaker 1>and a whole bunch of nutcases that think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aliens built the pyramids and all </v>

3479
02:57:34.991 --> 02:57:37.030
<v Speaker 1>of that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

3480
02:57:37.031 --> 02:57:39.040
<v Speaker 1>more people are interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many,</v>

3481
02:57:39.430 --> 02:57:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of those that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually capable of,</v>

3482
02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:47.433
<v Speaker 1>of sifting the evidence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually honest enough to accept </v>

3483
02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:58.750
<v Speaker 1>what stands up to scrutiny and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerically there,</v>

3484
02:57:58.751 --> 02:58:00.430
<v Speaker 1>there are lots more of them than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

3485
02:58:00.431 --> 02:58:01.264
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

3486
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:06.630
<v Speaker 3>there are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small percentage of very,</v>

3487
02:58:06.990 --> 02:58:11.990
<v Speaker 3>very small percentage of the populace </v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually care or understand it.</v>

3488
02:58:13.110 --> 02:58:13.943
<v Speaker 3>But it only takes a certain small </v>
<v Speaker 3>percentage of you ever tried to get </v>

3489
02:58:16.321 --> 02:58:18.630
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your magical Egypt series on Netflix?</v>

3490
02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:20.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3491
02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:21.493
<v Speaker 3>not on Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they probably wouldn't take it </v>

3492
02:58:23.310 --> 02:58:24.143
<v Speaker 3>because they'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd have to make a cup to cut a </v>

3493
02:58:28.711 --> 02:58:32.160
<v Speaker 3>really lousy deal with them and be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3494
02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:33.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3495
02:58:33.321 --> 02:58:35.370
<v Speaker 3>the numbers probably wouldn't justify </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3496
02:58:35.430 --> 02:58:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3497
02:58:36.581 --> 02:58:38.790
<v Speaker 3>they did love documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would you think that,</v>

3498
02:58:38.791 --> 02:58:40.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would want to cut a lousy deal?</v>

3499
02:58:41.250 --> 02:58:42.011
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3500
02:58:42.011 --> 02:58:42.540
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3501
02:58:42.540 --> 02:58:43.500
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3502
02:58:43.860 --> 02:58:47.190
<v Speaker 3>they really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really don't give you much.</v>

3503
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mystery of the swings is on there,</v>

3504
02:58:49.741 --> 02:58:53.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy who,</v>

3505
02:58:53.521 --> 02:58:54.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who did the,</v>

3506
02:58:54.510 --> 02:58:57.930
<v Speaker 3>who does the reproduction of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3507
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.823
<v Speaker 3>that negotiated with them and chance the</v>
<v Speaker 3>downside of chances that he's a bit </v>

3508
02:59:04.651 --> 02:59:07.350
<v Speaker 3>paranoid about letting stuff out of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

3509
02:59:07.650 --> 02:59:09.240
<v Speaker 3>So I've told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3510
02:59:09.241 --> 02:59:10.074
<v Speaker 3>cause that's the thing on Netflix or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean people have stolen it and it's on </v>

3511
02:59:13.861 --> 02:59:16.310
<v Speaker 3>youtube in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3512
02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:17.670
<v Speaker 3>in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3513
02:59:17.671 --> 02:59:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it's at the reproduction you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't see it unless you actually own the</v>

3514
02:59:22.111 --> 02:59:25.620
<v Speaker 3>DVD and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's chances baby as far as,</v>

3515
02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:28.690
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as pitching it and he doesn't,</v>

3516
02:59:28.691 --> 02:59:29.524
<v Speaker 3>then it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he hasn't even brought it up to </v>

3517
02:59:30.931 --> 02:59:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he has or not.</v>

3518
02:59:32.850 --> 02:59:35.070
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it'd be right up their </v>
<v Speaker 3>alley you would think.</v>

3519
02:59:35.071 --> 02:59:35.904
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've given up that of arguing the case </v>

3520
02:59:38.131 --> 02:59:40.200
<v Speaker 3>of he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says it's his,</v>

3521
02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:42.090
<v Speaker 3>it's his baby is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

3522
02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a big part of your work.</v>

3523
02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:45.593
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that that would be a great </v>

3524
02:59:46.771 --> 02:59:48.660
<v Speaker 3>venue for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be too,</v>

3525
02:59:48.661 --> 02:59:49.494
<v Speaker 3>but you write him and tell him that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a netflix trying to get on your </v>

3526
02:59:54.601 --> 02:59:56.490
<v Speaker 3>show for a while and hasn't been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3527
02:59:56.491 --> 02:59:58.270
<v Speaker 3>he's been emailing you a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

3528
02:59:58.590 --> 03:00:01.740
<v Speaker 3>Nobody me on the wrong address and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody responded.</v>

3529
03:00:01.741 --> 03:00:06.210
<v Speaker 3>So he gives up anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never got any emails from the dude.</v>

3530
03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about that after the show.</v>

3531
03:00:08.761 --> 03:00:09.960
<v Speaker 3>We'll try to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3532
03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:11.093
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a comedy special coming out on </v>

3533
03:00:12.571 --> 03:00:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Netflix and October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3534
03:00:14.140 --> 03:00:17.010
<v Speaker 3>Be Happy to talk to them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3535
03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:21.420
<v Speaker 3>this is something I should look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any idea what kind of deals</v>

3536
03:00:21.421 --> 03:00:22.254
<v Speaker 3>they cut in terms of documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I do know is that what you did </v>

3537
03:00:24.541 --> 03:00:26.610
<v Speaker 3>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think that it would,</v>

3538
03:00:26.611 --> 03:00:27.444
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>

3539
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:32.750
<v Speaker 3>it would be great for everybody to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have more access by just the,</v>

3540
03:00:32.970 --> 03:00:37.970
<v Speaker 3>just the sheer depth of the information </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go over like the temple and man</v>

3541
03:00:38.491 --> 03:00:39.324
<v Speaker 3>and all the different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just that the different incredible </v>

3542
03:00:42.811 --> 03:00:45.840
<v Speaker 3>structures that exist in Egypt that most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't even discuss.</v>

3543
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:46.703
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know about and they don't </v>

3544
03:00:47.431 --> 03:00:48.960
<v Speaker 3>want to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but chances,</v>

3545
03:00:49.410 --> 03:00:50.243
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3546
03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:51.413
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to really watch it because </v>

3547
03:00:52.530 --> 03:00:54.810
<v Speaker 3>people have told me this too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3548
03:00:54.811 --> 03:00:55.644
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not much into even dope by casually </v>

3549
03:00:58.561 --> 03:01:00.280
<v Speaker 3>smoke at in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not much,</v>

3550
03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Bob Cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My vice such as it is,</v>

3551
03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:07.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't even consider it vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3552
03:01:08.290 --> 03:01:09.123
<v Speaker 3>watching that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of talks to watch magical it </v>

3553
03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:14.170
<v Speaker 3>with a couple of Tux cause it slows </v>
<v Speaker 3>things down.</v>

3554
03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:15.453
<v Speaker 3>The editing on that as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as breathtaking and there's a hypnotic </v>

3555
03:01:18.611 --> 03:01:20.800
<v Speaker 3>quality to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

3556
03:01:20.890 --> 03:01:23.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's an extraordinary achievement</v>
<v Speaker 3>in shock.</v>

3557
03:01:23.321 --> 03:01:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Did it on second shock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean chance did it on a zero budget,</v>

3558
03:01:27.821 --> 03:01:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing all of the photography,</v>

3559
03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:32.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean everything single handed on </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

3560
03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:36.520
<v Speaker 3>It's really the heroic production and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3561
03:01:36.521 --> 03:01:38.380
<v Speaker 3>and we made nothing out of it.</v>

3562
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to get it on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want,</v>

3563
03:01:40.841 --> 03:01:43.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to make an attempt so </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you attend,</v>

3564
03:01:43.511 --> 03:01:44.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

3565
03:01:44.010 --> 03:01:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to make an attempt.</v>

3566
03:01:45.371 --> 03:01:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bring it to them and have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with them.</v>

3567
03:01:47.441 --> 03:01:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3568
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:49.730
<v Speaker 3>They stink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give,</v>

3569
03:01:50.350 --> 03:01:52.570
<v Speaker 3>give him a copy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might not even know.</v>

3570
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:53.311
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

3571
03:01:53.311 --> 03:01:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a lead out now.</v>

3572
03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:58.330
<v Speaker 3>I really think it's one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

3573
03:01:58.990 --> 03:02:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I think it's to May and it's so in </v>
<v Speaker 3>depth.</v>

3574
03:02:01.481 --> 03:02:04.510
<v Speaker 3>It's so in depth into the only way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do it was to self produce it.</v>

3575
03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:05.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3576
03:02:05.441 --> 03:02:07.500
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't get anyone to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody would go,</v>

3577
03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:11.050
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do eight dvds on enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you out of your mind?</v>

3578
03:02:11.051 --> 03:02:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to watch all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch it like three or four times.</v>

3579
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people,</v>

3580
03:02:15.390 --> 03:02:16.750
<v Speaker 3>you have a magical Egypt too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3581
03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:17.793
<v Speaker 3>Well we're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the funding and then </v>

3582
03:02:19.831 --> 03:02:22.510
<v Speaker 3>actually this is chances baby now cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3583
03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:29.800
<v Speaker 3>anytime he wants me I'm there for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not in any position to to really</v>

3584
03:02:29.801 --> 03:02:32.230
<v Speaker 3>help with it because I'm so swamped with</v>
<v Speaker 3>my own stuff.</v>

3585
03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:34.450
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he covered in magical Egypt.</v>

3586
03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:35.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3587
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:40.030
<v Speaker 3>We've got the first one semi done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what he's got in mind.</v>

3588
03:02:40.031 --> 03:02:42.130
<v Speaker 3>And this is what Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't get to see him.</v>

3589
03:02:42.131 --> 03:02:46.750
<v Speaker 3>The doll and it's even skype is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not good for in depth,</v>

3590
03:02:46.751 --> 03:02:48.710
<v Speaker 3>evening long conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3591
03:02:49.230 --> 03:02:52.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll bet if you showed it to Netflix</v>

3592
03:02:52.181 --> 03:02:54.730
<v Speaker 3>and they expressed an interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be interested,</v>

3593
03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.110
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do that.</v>

3594
03:02:56.110 --> 03:02:58.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bring them a copy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to see what we could do.</v>

3595
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:59.463
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things that I really </v>

3596
03:03:00.910 --> 03:03:01.743
<v Speaker 3>believe that people should say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that and I think that if you could </v>

3597
03:03:03.431 --> 03:03:04.264
<v Speaker 3>get it on Netflix and I could tweet it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and let the world know and try to get </v>

3598
03:03:07.991 --> 03:03:10.120
<v Speaker 3>people to spread the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think once people see it,</v>

3599
03:03:10.121 --> 03:03:12.580
<v Speaker 3>they just start like that making of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderer thing.</v>

3600
03:03:12.581 --> 03:03:13.414
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that caught all that traction </v>

3601
03:03:14.470 --> 03:03:17.650
<v Speaker 3>entirely because it was on Netflix and </v>
<v Speaker 3>word of mouth mostly.</v>

3602
03:03:18.070 --> 03:03:18.920
<v Speaker 3>I really think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3603
03:03:19.270 --> 03:03:21.220
<v Speaker 3>that magical Egypt is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3604
03:03:21.221 --> 03:03:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3605
03:03:21.700 --> 03:03:22.533
<v Speaker 3>Well what I would like to do actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hope my pal clay and some other </v>

3606
03:03:25.901 --> 03:03:29.260
<v Speaker 3>people are going to help me with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to get some of my other,</v>

3607
03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:32.910
<v Speaker 3>when I'm wearing my other hat and my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my uh,</v>

3608
03:03:33.700 --> 03:03:37.050
<v Speaker 3>my writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Bohemian Barei instead of my Egypt,</v>

3609
03:03:37.051 --> 03:03:39.240
<v Speaker 3>a logical pith helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I've got a,</v>

3610
03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean a whole lifetimes worth of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much of which has been produced but none</v>

3611
03:03:44.441 --> 03:03:45.670
<v Speaker 3>of it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3612
03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:50.050
<v Speaker 3>commercially successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just sitting there waiting to get</v>

3613
03:03:50.051 --> 03:03:50.884
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And netflix would be the perfect venue </v>

3614
03:03:52.841 --> 03:03:56.390
<v Speaker 3>for it if I had something to show him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3615
03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:58.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they do production,</v>

3616
03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:00.900
<v Speaker 6>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're producers now too.</v>

3617
03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:02.203
<v Speaker 6>It's an interesting time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's one of the best things </v>

3618
03:04:03.741 --> 03:04:04.574
<v Speaker 6>about the internet is that something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that can kind of spring up and </v>

3619
03:04:07.731 --> 03:04:10.640
<v Speaker 6>become a bigger net worth than any of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the networks on television.</v>

3620
03:04:10.641 --> 03:04:11.030
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

3621
03:04:11.030 --> 03:04:11.863
<v Speaker 6>that's the upside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well the networks are about to die and </v>

3622
03:04:13.731 --> 03:04:16.270
<v Speaker 6>good riddance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well it's a silly idea what,</v>

3623
03:04:16.310 --> 03:04:18.770
<v Speaker 6>it was good back when there was no other</v>
<v Speaker 6>ideas.</v>

3624
03:04:19.090 --> 03:04:19.923
<v Speaker 6>You had to sit through those commercials</v>
<v Speaker 6>and wait for the next segment and then </v>

3625
03:04:22.401 --> 03:04:24.700
<v Speaker 6>you watch 10 minutes and the is popped </v>
<v Speaker 6>on again.</v>

3626
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:25.543
<v Speaker 6>You rolled your eyes and waited for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>commercials again and that all that </v>

3627
03:04:28.371 --> 03:04:30.080
<v Speaker 6>stuff's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you watch a commercial,</v>

3628
03:04:30.081 --> 03:04:32.420
<v Speaker 6>now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is this silly thing?</v>

3629
03:04:32.450 --> 03:04:35.390
<v Speaker 6>Well the Internet's full of commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it is,</v>

3630
03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:36.560
<v Speaker 6>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at least,</v>

3631
03:04:36.561 --> 03:04:37.394
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least they're usually at the </v>

3632
03:04:38.151 --> 03:04:40.790
<v Speaker 6>beginning of a video and then in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle,</v>

3633
03:04:40.791 --> 03:04:43.190
<v Speaker 6>sometimes things near there.</v>
