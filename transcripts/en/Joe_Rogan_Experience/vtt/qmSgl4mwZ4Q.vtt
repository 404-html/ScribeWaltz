7
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>and this was in Russia.</v>

8
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

9
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.650

<v Speaker 1>it was a c c of Russian people.</v>

16
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>

18
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

19
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>This was in 1991,</v>

20
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>91 91 when the,</v>

21
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>the curtain came down and all of that,</v>

23
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and a Time Warner had a,</v>

24
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to basically get their foot in the door.</v>

27
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And so they were created a free concert.</v>

28
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.043
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

30
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it was a ACDC,</v>

31
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

32
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.251
<v Speaker 1>Pantera,</v>

33
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>and I think maybe a local band or some other bands.</v>

34
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:51.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry if,</v>

35
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:52.081
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

36
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>But they flew us in there.</v>

37
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>We landed in this airfield.</v>

38
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

39
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Motley crew was on it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>landed in this airfield.</v>

42
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And as far as the eye could see it,</v>

43
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:02.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>it was a free concert and it was just people,</v>

45
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and we get on stage and do what we do.</v>

46
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.793
<v Speaker 1>But there were,</v>

47
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.030

<v Speaker 1>that might be something else,</v>

64
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>but it looks a little newer,</v>

65
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>but it says here it was from 91 mosque house.</v>
