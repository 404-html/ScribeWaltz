00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>That's fish bones.</v>

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:05.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:05.771
<v Speaker 1>the Salton Sea.</v>

5
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's fish bones.</v>

6
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.291
<v Speaker 1>Say what?</v>

7
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:07.401
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

8
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>The salt and sea is not really a set as the primary cause of the white sand of</v>

9
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.444
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>

10
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

11
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Why are we playing games?</v>

12
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't hide it's parrot fish.</v>

13
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Yet really?</v>

14
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We're literally going to be walking around on white.</v>

15
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.921
<v Speaker 1>White Sand.</v>

16
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Beaches are made from parrot fish poop.</v>

17
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

18
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm so pumped that I taught jewelry and some crazy.</v>

19
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>That is insane as possible.</v>

20
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>That's in that.</v>

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

22
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It just shits like crazy things.</v>

23
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

24
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.553
<v Speaker 1>Sand.</v>

25
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

26
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.731
<v Speaker 1>It's shit.</v>

27
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Sand.</v>

28
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Does that thing eat like a reef.</v>

29
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.511
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

30
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Eating it at a hunting camp.</v>

31
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

32
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Eat Worms.</v>

33
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Sponges and oysters also produced Pacific Ocean stand sand,</v>

34
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.931
<v Speaker 1>but no animal.</v>

35
00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>This is proficient as the parrot fish</v>

36
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.333
<v Speaker 1>stomachs.</v>

37
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

38
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Meals past bypass,</v>

39
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>like a gastric bypass or someone that has lower</v>

40
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>producing as much as 840 pounds of sand per year.</v>

41
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if your poor little asshole had a process yours?</v>

42
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You're a big giant guy of your poor little asshole process.</v>

43
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Eight hundred and 40 pounds of sand per.</v>

44
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>let's break that down.</v>

46
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>How many pounds is that a day?</v>

47
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Because 365 days in a year and it's what is.</v>

48
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>It's more than double that,</v>

49
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.703
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>What would a 40 pounds.</v>

52
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>So that is more than two pounds of sand through your asshole every day for a</v>

53
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.641
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

54
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity.</v>

55
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Now that you're a fish.</v>

56
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>So think of that.</v>

57
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a person.</v>

58
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a fish.</v>

59
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>A little fish.</v>

60
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's pumping out more than two pounds of sand through its tiny little asshole</v>

61
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

62
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

63
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a thing like this.</v>

64
00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And instead they dig their heels in and get confirmation bias from all these</v>

66
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:04.344
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

67
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And then they formed these social media groups,</v>

68
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>facebook groups,</v>

69
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>they go to websites,</v>

70
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>they get on web forums and they started interacting with each other and</v>

71
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>exclusively interacted with each other.</v>

72
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>And then also in forcing each other's beliefs and.</v>

73
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>And great job man.</v>

74
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Good job of attacking those shills right?</v>

75
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>You know those,</v>

76
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>like if you do know,</v>

77
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>if you think the earth is round,</v>

78
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you were at globe tarred.</v>

79
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>That's the newest.</v>

80
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Jamie literally like cringed.</v>

81
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>He took them head.</v>

82
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I had to like step back.</v>

83
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.873
<v Speaker 1>Blink his eyes.</v>

84
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>You're a globe toward,</v>

86
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

88
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing is because these people,</v>

89
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>someone said something that someone wants.</v>

90
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

91
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>people love to finance secrets.</v>

92
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>They love the dinosaur thing is cool because it seems to be real and suddenly</v>

93
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>see the gal that said that,</v>

94
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>all the fossils were basically people doing like kind of Michelangelo deal and</v>

96
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Chiseling the matter rock because the fossils came out of rock.</v>

97
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

98
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:57.614
<v Speaker 1>you got in?</v>

99
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>She actually what?</v>

100
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>She has been pretty nice boobs too.</v>

101
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

102
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why people are listening,</v>

103
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I've got a platform now.</v>

104
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 1>You've gotten tits.</v>

105
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.133
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

106
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it's really good.</v>

107
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

109
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>So she's basically like,</v>

110
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:13.961
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

111
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>so these things come out of rocks.</v>

112
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So these anthropologists,</v>

113
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>because there's millions of dollars in anthropology or archeology there just</v>

114
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>chiseling these bones out of rock.</v>

115
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And here we go into her</v>

116
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 2>fossils that are found in the ground.</v>

117
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to play games against dinosaurs.</v>

118
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't need to play some of this.</v>

119
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.431
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

120
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit about the composition and composition,</v>

121
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>what they end up being when everything is said and done.</v>

122
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

123
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

124
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.501
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

125
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 2>fossil,</v>

126
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.763
<v Speaker 2>fossil,</v>

127
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 2>fossil is actually a bone that was once in the ground that has been filled with</v>

128
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 2>limestone,</v>

129
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 2>calcium and other kinds of stone link deposits over the course of many,</v>

130
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:10.820
<v Speaker 2>many years left eyes at a patch of the day looking like,</v>

131
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.823
<v Speaker 2>why is she doing that?</v>

132
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 2>What's your fucking hair out of your rock this big?</v>

133
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.740
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

134
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.573
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

135
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of fossils.</v>

136
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Can you hand the rock off?</v>

137
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 2>So paleontologist,</v>

138
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 2>the paleontologist takes a little mallet and they chip away at it and at some</v>

139
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>point they come out with something looking like a bomb and this is a problem.</v>

140
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.791
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

141
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>

142
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.403
<v Speaker 2>Just pause that.</v>

143
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>The problem is some fucking idiot.</v>

144
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Like this gets to talk about a subject that she's not educated in and no one is</v>

145
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.304
<v Speaker 1>over her shoulder got,</v>

146
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.533
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

147
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

148
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>It's strange.</v>

149
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You said something that I want to go back to.</v>

150
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.821
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

151
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>what do you think feminism is about?</v>

152
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>What's his argument about?</v>

153
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:51.964
<v Speaker 1>About equality?</v>

154
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

155
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

156
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>feminism was about equality and I think that this,</v>

157
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

158
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

159
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading more about it and learning more about it,</v>

161
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>so I'm still very ignorant about it,</v>

162
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>but there's more third wave,</v>

163
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>what they call third wave feminism,</v>

164
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure is a term you've heard that seems to be more about a combative</v>

165
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>nature to actually,</v>

166
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>instead of like saying like men and women are equal,</v>

168
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 1>men and women should deserve the same rights in the same treatment and all those</v>

169
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

170
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>It's actually seems to be very anti man in a way.</v>

171
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems to be very,</v>

172
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>like almost like the tables have turned and I'm like,</v>

173
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>but why are you turning the tables like we didn't you achieve what you want in</v>

174
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>like in the first place,</v>

175
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 1>which was just that we were going to be here together at the,</v>

176
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

177
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>at the nexus of everything as two genders.</v>

178
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem is that reinforcing that fake statistic,</v>

179
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>the gender pay gap that so many people have heard that,</v>

180
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>like Sarah Silverman was just talking about it recently and some,</v>

181
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>some big thing that she did.</v>

182
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

183
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>that's not true,</v>

184
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:47.670
<v Speaker 1>but yet people just say it and no one stops them from Santa.</v>

185
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.161
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>

186
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>there's was a very educated guy said it.</v>

187
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>We were having a debate about,</v>

188
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:51.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

189
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>a divorce and he brought it up and I'm like,</v>

190
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>that's not even true.</v>

191
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately in a place with no</v>

192
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 3>cell phone reception,</v>

193
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 3>so I had to wait until we got back to send it to them.</v>

194
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

195
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 3>this is not true.</v>

196
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Like what you're saying is not true.</v>

197
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Like you're repeating it as if you know,</v>

198
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile you've done zero research on it.</v>

199
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a talking point that just gets reiterated over and over again without any</v>

200
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.043
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>

201
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>And it's convenient.</v>

202
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 3>It's convenient to reinforce your argument.</v>

203
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a number.</v>

204
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a number that deals with a very complex and nuanced debate.</v>

205
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the idea of feminism is to me in a lot of ways,</v>

206
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 3>very similar to the idea of the men's rights movement.</v>

207
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to rights for anybody.</v>

208
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to anyone.</v>

209
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm very egalitarianism ideas about the world,</v>

210
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 3>but I am opposed to anybody that likes one gender over the other because I think</v>

211
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:41.181
<v Speaker 3>that's foolish.</v>

212
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Just like I'm opposed to people that only like white people.</v>

213
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm to put pose to people that only like black people.</v>

214
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm opposed to people that generalize based on an enormous mass of human beings.</v>

215
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Like men are shit,</v>

216
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.163
<v Speaker 3>women rule,</v>

217
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 3>girls rule,</v>

218
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 3>boys drool,</v>

219
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

221
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it the other way either.</v>

222
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it that he man,</v>

223
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 3>woman haters club I don't like.</v>

224
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't like any ideologies that lump people into these huge groups because I</v>

225
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 3>think it's more on think.</v>

226
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a stupid way of looking at the world.</v>

227
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 3>But we have started water towers.</v>

228
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 3>So basically we drill a well and then we have a water tower which turns into a</v>

229
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 3>water kiosk where people from the community come up to it.</v>

230
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 3>They might pay pay five shillings for Jerry,</v>

231
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.601
<v Speaker 3>so jerry cans,</v>

232
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 3>five gallons,</v>

233
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 3>they pay five cents,</v>

234
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 3>but eventually all the people in the community,</v>

235
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 3>the one that Rwanda we're doing,</v>

236
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 3>it's going to serve 4,000 people.</v>

237
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 3>It's at a school so the kids will have clean water all throughout the day,</v>

238
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 3>but then people come there and the one in Kenya is funding a school,</v>

239
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 3>but the one in Rwanda is going to fund more water wells.</v>

240
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 3>So as these people by clean water,</v>

241
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.840
<v Speaker 3>the only clean water around there,</v>

242
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.591
<v Speaker 3>that community,</v>

243
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 3>the only thing they have to drink,</v>

244
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.851
<v Speaker 3>there's a lake that has the cows and everything else drinking out of it.</v>

245
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Cow patties are inside the water</v>

246
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 3>and you can see people collecting water at the same time that cows are drinking</v>

247
00:07:58.491 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 3>from it right beside them.</v>

248
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 3>People are washing clothes in it,</v>

249
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 3>they're watching motorcycles in it.</v>

250
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

251
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 3>and then that's their drinking water.</v>

252
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 3>And so we're putting up this water kiosk where yeah,</v>

253
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 3>we're going to charge them five cents when they get five gallons of clean water,</v>

254
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 3>but those are going to turn it into multiple water wells throughout the year.</v>

255
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 3>And so we're trying to do all these sustainable solutions to where after we do</v>

256
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.504
<v Speaker 3>that in Rwanda,</v>

257
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 3>we're taking that to the Congo,</v>

258
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 3>there'll be close to the soa production facility in the community development</v>

259
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:22.791
<v Speaker 3>center.</v>

260
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:23.624
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have,</v>

261
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.471
<v Speaker 3>which will have land,</v>

262
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:24.831
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

263
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 3>food solutions,</v>

264
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

265
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 3>even the forestry we felt to replant over 4,000 trees in the Congo.</v>

266
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.971
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

267
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 3>because of deforestation,</v>

268
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:33.914
<v Speaker 3>so brutal.</v>

269
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's just sitting back and saying,</v>

270
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 3>what do you guys need?</v>

271
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Listening and learning that need and saying,</v>

272
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.871
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

273
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:39.704
<v Speaker 3>where can we fit in?</v>

274
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 3>How can we help in this area?</v>

275
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Who is a specialist?</v>

276
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 3>How can we really make an impact?</v>

277
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I think our lane is definitely water.</v>

278
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean from that chiefly Omi village or the story that you just saw,</v>

279
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 3>the bofi where he made that knife where you,</v>

280
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

281
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 3>you can see that water changes everything.</v>

282
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 3>And so that's going to be what hubs,</v>

283
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.241
<v Speaker 3>that's our hub,</v>

284
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:00.590
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

285
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 3>that's our lane.</v>

286
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's what all of the water teams are doing.</v>

287
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.341
<v Speaker 3>But in the Congo,</v>

288
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 3>because of the pygmies are so vulnerable,</v>

289
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.360
