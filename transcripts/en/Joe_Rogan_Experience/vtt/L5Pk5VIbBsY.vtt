00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>That's okay with black faces,</v>

12
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.320
<v Speaker 1>they are allowed to wear that stuff that makes your skin look dark so that you</v>

13
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>can see the muscles better,</v>

14
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>but they get to a point where it's literally,</v>

15
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's blackface,</v>
