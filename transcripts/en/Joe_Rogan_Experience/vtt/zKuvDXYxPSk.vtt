00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>But I don't recommend you jump right </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the deep end.</v>

11
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like trying heroin before you tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot,</v>

12
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's tight and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well.</v>

13
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.410

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>don't know if this is really good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

16
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might develop some bad social habits.</v>

17
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Forced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forced yourself on it.</v>

18
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Just baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

19
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

20
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Just let me get through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a terrible,</v>

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing.</v>

22
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

23
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>What does the instincts that I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anal sex was so popular with the </v>

24
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>young people these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is because of the porn.</v>

25
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>The porn is fuck the kids heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's two things as the porn and </v>

26
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.491
<v Speaker 1>it's the Bush administration really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was actually this study </v>

27
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>each other said like eight years of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>of abstinence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only education in the US.</v>

29
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>They got rid of anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstinence only education in the </v>

30
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.261
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all these kids have grown up </v>

31
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:03.261
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

32
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>well if they take it in the ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still virgins.</v>

33
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

34
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all these,</v>

35
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like Christian kids in the Bible belt </v>
<v Speaker 1>are all having anal sex because of this.</v>

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But the blowback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unintentional blowback.</v>

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>There was always a few girls like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were young that did you know </v>

38
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>that they were still virgins if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>took in the ass.</v>

39
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>There was like one or two girls that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had heard about,</v>

40

88
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.821
<v Speaker 1>funny premise and it was written by </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys who had written the simpsons </v>

89
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>and they'd worked on married with </v>

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Kern and Jeff Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really funny guys,</v>

91
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>but they were very much writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very quiet guys.</v>

92
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>There were little socially awkward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the network just did not think that they</v>

93
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>would be able to handle producing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

94
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So they brought in this ultimate hack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember his name was bill </v>

95
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>something or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was death.</v>

96
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Every joke was death is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of his instincts were terrible.</v>

97
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It was just the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most hacky shit.</v>

98
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>The guy who never said a funny thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life.</v>

99
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>So I got to see the worst aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood and then,</v>

100
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was totally ready to bail and go back </v>

101
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 1>to New York and just go back to doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>

102
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately I leased a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment because I was convinced that </v>

103
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>this show is going to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every idiot.</v>

104
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And maybe it was just the stench of </v>

120
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:25.051
<v Speaker 1>nervousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>So he was like a panic now I guess he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

122
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

123
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.050
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:32.500

<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

126
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to let ray go.</v>

127
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ready though.</v>

128
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>All the time thinking that something's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going terrible.</v>

129
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys always thinks that </v>

130
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>things are going wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent,</v>

131
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.270
<v Speaker 1>he did an interview on the Green Room </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Paul provenza show where he said </v>

132
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.271
<v Speaker 1>that still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes onstage and the audience cheers </v>

133
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and he feels like a fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>he steps out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love him,</v>

135
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking 10 years.</v>

136
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>A Great Sitcom,</v>

137
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>a great standup comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali's people love him.</v>

138
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't even like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very,</v>

139
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
<v Speaker 2>he gets out there and it just weirds out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that all these people actually </v>

140
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 2>like him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

141
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the guy that did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>part during the pilot and then just that</v>

142
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.700
<v Speaker 2>was it for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just didn't use them after that.</v>

143
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name now.</v>

144
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think they considered this </v>

145
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 2>poor fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

146
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.370
<v Speaker 2>he was just there as an interim filler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Which is a horrible position to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>So I was in my apartment and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a deal with NBC,</v>

149
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:34.880
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a development deal and they</v>

150
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:39.881
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a show that we would like </v>

151
00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:41.201
<v Speaker 2>you to read for if you're interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they gave me the tape and I </v>

152
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

153
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking good.</v>

154
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

155
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 2>No Way I can get on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is like a real show,</v>

156
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>like the other hardball show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>

157
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 2>It sort of made sense like why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked me with zero acting ever to be on</v>

158
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>this Sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

159
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 2>because they're idiots and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck they doing,</v>

160
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all of a sudden this was like this </v>

161
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 2>real NPC show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

162
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I can still remember being there on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first day of set.</v>

164
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:09.251
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking sitting right next to Phil </v>

165
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:09.251
<v Speaker 2>Hartman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how weird is this?</v>

166
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally had,</v>

167
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.230
<v Speaker 2>when I got my development deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made me take some acting classes.</v>

168
00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So I took some one-on-one acting classes</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some crazy failed actress,</v>

169
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:21.641
<v Speaker 2>woman in New York who was unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter and play like weird psychological</v>

170
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:27.281
<v Speaker 2>games with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give your teaching </v>

171
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:27.281
<v Speaker 2>certificate unless you're unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter.</v>

172
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 2>She was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she was trying to angle a job.</v>

173
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 2>She kept trying to angle a job to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother.</v>

174
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a mom and this </v>

175
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 2>fucking script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy bitch.</v>

176
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a thing that comes up to play</v>

177
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 2>your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to use it right now.</v>

178
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

179
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden we're on news radio.</v>

180
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>

182
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.460
<v Speaker 2>because we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

183
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.600
<v Speaker 2>we had a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was a,</v>

184
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joe character was different animals.</v>

185
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:53.910
<v Speaker 2>So the Catherine character was </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

186
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 2>A different actor playing catherine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

187
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

188
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Candy both came in at the same time.</v>

189
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

190
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I just ran into candy recently at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>

191
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 2>She still looks like she's 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm raising black.</v>

192
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Don't crack baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some about those genes.</v>

193
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Looks fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's healthy and vibrant,</v>

195
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.750
<v Speaker 2>yet survived as CSI Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she bolted from that show too.</v>

196
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw her.</v>

197
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

198
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on that show anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>

199
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 2>She's famous for leaving shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is gorgeous.</v>

200
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>She's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a wild bitch.</v>

201
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>She's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kenny Alexander is awesome.</v>

202
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I love her when she's legitimately wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she,</v>

203
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't take any shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She quit newsradio because she wasn't </v>

204
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 2>getting enough jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

205
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 2>she just decided there's a TV show on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air and it's doing really well and </v>

206
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>she's getting some silly amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week and she's like,</v>

207
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.630
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

208
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 2>They're not appreciating me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gone.</v>

209
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 2>And the writers were completely in </v>
<v Speaker 2>denial about it.</v>

210
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It was the weirdest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 2>when it came up and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

212
00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

213
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you talking about,</v>

214
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

215
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

216
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.440
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of white guys from Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not able to write for a,</v>

217
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 2>for a black woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black woman.</v>

218
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't even seem like it's almost </v>

219
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.290
<v Speaker 2>seemed like they just didn't bother you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

220
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even try.</v>

221
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 2>they had her there and then if it fit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could use her,</v>

223
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:18.261
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally they put the word honey</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the start of a sentence when you're </v>

224
00:09:18.261 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 2>on a show and there's eight people as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sitcom was such a weird environment,</v>

225
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:26.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in eight people are struggling to get </v>

226
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:26.631
<v Speaker 2>their own little thing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:31.040
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird little tense environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be very strange and for her I guess </v>

228
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>it was just disappointing over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

229
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

230
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of people liked that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this,</v>

231
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:42.321
<v Speaker 2>and this is a very odd pardon history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Dave Foley literally wrote half of </v>

232
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.670
<v Speaker 2>that show and half of it on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you.</v>

233
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 2>You were like an unaccredited producer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

234
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would have never worked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way it works without you.</v>

235
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I guess it's.</v>

236
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it's a generous over</v>

237
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.520
<v Speaker 2>overstatement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>

238
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went over every scene.</v>

239
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.710
<v Speaker 2>You didn't just rehearse the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went over every scene and you went </v>

240
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.880
<v Speaker 2>over with the beats and you came up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternatives.</v>

241
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Every single time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

242
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless the scene was absolutely perfect.</v>

243
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was ever a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we didn't dabble with things.</v>

244
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we all.</v>

245
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess everyone does.</v>

246
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:19.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

247
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the cast you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

248
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and me and Phil and Andy were all </v>

249
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:26.360
<v Speaker 3>used to creating their own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

250
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we,</v>

251
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:32.361
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone came into it with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to think on their feet and </v>

252
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:32.361
<v Speaker 3>change stuff.</v>

253
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing that Paul Lettuce as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he did.</v>

254
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know He,</v>

255
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Simms who was a producer of road </v>

256
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.591
<v Speaker 2>who also worked on the Larry Sanders </v>
<v Speaker 2>show before that was a really young guy </v>

257
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:44.690
<v Speaker 2>at the time and just really bright and </v>
<v Speaker 2>really great writer,</v>

258
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>great writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just knew that we could fuck around </v>

259
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.380
<v Speaker 2>and make different things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

260
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 2>when you're actually on the set and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're acting it out,</v>

261
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it doesn't come off as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as it is on a written page.</v>

262
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes there's an obvious or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>so obvious alternative,</v>

263
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's just amazing that he let us do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

264
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they.</v>

265
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

266
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.110
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we read rework,</v>

267
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:08.111
<v Speaker 3>Steph turn rehearsals and find different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things we thought were funnier and then </v>

268
00:11:08.111 --> 00:11:11.651
<v Speaker 3>we'd just run it for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd run it for Paul and the other </v>

269
00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:11.651
<v Speaker 3>writers at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they liked it,</v>

270
00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:12.170
<v Speaker 3>it would show up in the script the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

271
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like both of your characters </v>
<v Speaker 3>were pretty much really well written for</v>

272
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:22.541
<v Speaker 3>you guys because like you to at least I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't feel and didn't really seem like </v>

273
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:22.541
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

274
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:23.900
<v Speaker 3>in real life I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seemed like you were,</v>

275
00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:26.450
<v Speaker 3>you and you are you in on that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sort of.</v>

276
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave was more innocent and I was more </v>

277
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.210
<v Speaker 3>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you had your theories and stuff like</v>

278
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.960
<v Speaker 3>that have incorporated aspects of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>personalities.</v>

279
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

280
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:37.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

281
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave Nelson is probably a real mix of me</v>

282
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:45.490
<v Speaker 3>and fill and fail me and Paul Simms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.220
<v Speaker 3>so it'd be depending on who the rightest</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt like mocking more that day.</v>

284
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

285
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I was a just a more retarded</v>

286
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.910
<v Speaker 1>version of me with special gifts that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't possess.</v>

287
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:11:57.941 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>You were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>You were a conspiracy theorist with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of the fonts.</v>

290
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun gig though.</v>

291
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last year was oddest.</v>

292
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.980
<v Speaker 1>But other than that it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of fun and I'm glad we did </v>

294
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.670
<v Speaker 1>the last year because I would've hated </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not see everyone after.</v>

295
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>That would've been terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I always assumed we would be hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time from now on,</v>

297
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.730
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that point on,</v>

298
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but it really didn't work out that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

299
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never does,</v>

300
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

301
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it's true because everybody goes in such</v>
<v Speaker 1>different directions.</v>

302
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I ran into Maura once or twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a wrench,</v>

303
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but once we had a good time at one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those NBC functions and I was on news </v>

304
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>radio or fear factor and she was on er </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we got drunk together.</v>

305
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the old days reminded me is </v>

306
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:44.820
<v Speaker 1>always fun to get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

307
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>She's one of the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

308
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>She was the one who convinced me to kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the craft service door.</v>

309
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.250
<v Speaker 1>All hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

310
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had some good times and that set </v>

311
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.280
<v Speaker 1>after the set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after filming we would basically just </v>

312
00:12:59.280 --> 00:12:59.280
<v Speaker 1>drink all night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.050
<v Speaker 1>filming would be done at whatever and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all have our mini fridge is stocked in </v>

314
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.290
<v Speaker 1>our coolers and we were just getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammered and just shoot the shit and </v>

315
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 1>have fun and laugh and go over to Dave's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined listed some weird music.</v>

316
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Dave voice had some weird chicks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made you want to cry.</v>

317

<v Speaker 1>like really catered to people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the set.</v>

347
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.590
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one time I remember we were </v>

348
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.361
<v Speaker 1>about to go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a live audience there and </v>

349
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:32.711
<v Speaker 1>everybody was getting ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready and we were standing in </v>

350
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:32.711
<v Speaker 1>that little back hallway where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would introduce us and,</v>

351
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 1>that this is going to be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

353
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

354
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.930
<v Speaker 1>when we're older and we're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I didn't enjoy this </v>

355
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:42.930
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe.</v>

356
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't appreciate how crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is more.</v>

357
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize what a random stroke </v>
<v Speaker 1>of luck it is to get so cool people </v>

358
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:52.480
<v Speaker 1>altogether</v>

359
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 2>in one group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

360
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:54.270
<v Speaker 2>The fact that,</v>

361
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all wanted to spend time together,</v>

362
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

363
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.530
<v Speaker 3>like when work was done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody can go.</v>

364
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wanted to stay.</v>

365
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.730
<v Speaker 2>We all had fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

366
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really weird environment.</v>

367
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird environment to in </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatively.</v>

368
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so rare that a sitcom works.</v>

369
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

370
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:15.941
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been given scripts to sitcoms and </v>

371
00:15:15.941 --> 00:15:15.941
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get into them.</v>

372
00:15:15.941 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up in some recent audition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a year ago I guess it was,</v>

373
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even read it a little bit and </v>

374
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.781
<v Speaker 2>then I looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I going to do with </v>

375
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:25.781
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's just,</v>

376
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:25.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

377
00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:25.781
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like,</v>

378
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 2>like you were there when lightening hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

379
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be,</v>

380
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.150
<v Speaker 2>you don't wanna you know.</v>

381
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>

382
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.190
<v Speaker 3>it was like we were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the very first time I think we were</v>

383
00:15:36.191 --> 00:15:39.610
<v Speaker 3>all together on state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like we'd been there for years.</v>

384
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Like it felt like a group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been working together for,</v>

385
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:43.900
<v Speaker 3>for a long time.</v>

386
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.600
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such a weird environment.</v>

387
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Such a weird experience for me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

388
00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I had no acting experience nor </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspirations to act.</v>

389
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 2>It was strictly a by greed alone that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wound up in Hollywood because they </v>

390
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.230
<v Speaker 2>offered me all this money to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom and I was like,</v>

391
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.400
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

392
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden I'm here and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally less than,</v>

393
00:16:03.011 --> 00:16:05.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six months after that show was canceled.</v>

394
00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm on news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

395
00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:08.190
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so bizarre.</v>

396
00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:13.191
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have the same kind of like </v>

397
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:13.191
<v Speaker 2>thrown into it when you were young when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you started kids in the hall.</v>

398
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I was 28 while I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 19 when I started working with </v>

399
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Mcdonald Flower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was 26.</v>

400
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.700
<v Speaker 3>I was 25.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the series started.</v>

401
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.210
<v Speaker 2>And were you a comic before or were you </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and kind of Improv as well?</v>

402
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit high school and started</v>

403
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.670
<v Speaker 3>doing standup when I was like 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

404
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then how long did you do it for?</v>

405
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.640
<v Speaker 3>Just for like just let even two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About a year and a half.</v>

406
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.910
<v Speaker 3>I had quit when I was just around my </v>
<v Speaker 3>19th birthday.</v>

407
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:42.340
<v Speaker 3>And that is exactly when you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into kids in the hall.</v>

408
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quit after I met Kevin Mcdonald and </v>

409
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.400
<v Speaker 3>started doing stuff with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped doing standup.</v>

410
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.260
<v Speaker 3>So just focused all your time on </v>
<v Speaker 3>sketches and stuff like that.</v>

411
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing a joint is improv group.</v>

412
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're like both theater sports </v>

413
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 3>and it was taken like second city </v>
<v Speaker 3>workshops and you know,</v>

414
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.040
<v Speaker 3>and that led pretty I guess fairly </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly within a few years to the,</v>

415
00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:08.041
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole five men version of the kids </v>

416
00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:08.890
<v Speaker 3>in the hall that became the TV show,</v>

417
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.440
<v Speaker 2>which they played nonstop in the United </v>

468
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:20.151
<v Speaker 1>exactly how you said until we stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were looking there and there was </v>

469
00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:20.800
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them in you.</v>

470
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just stopped and paused and said </v>

471
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:25.840
<v Speaker 1>someone needs to tell that young man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay.</v>

472
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 1>We went into work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would be right,</v>

473
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:33.651
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where these cars were parked and right </v>

474
00:19:33.651 --> 00:19:36.170
<v Speaker 1>directly in front of the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd open up the door and basically </v>

475
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.801
<v Speaker 1>be on the set and right behind that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking guy in his car blaring his </v>

476
00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 1>own music from some insane stereo </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

477
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And if your music is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the is great,</v>

478
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong to sit there and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own music in the car.</v>

479
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Plant is in his car.</v>

480
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Fucking beating the drums to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

483
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.410

<v Speaker 1>but when you're Joey Lawrence,</v>

499
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It was like a tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were there.</v>

500
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember because I remember a tray was</v>

<v Speaker 1>A jumpsuit serve a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like really shiny,</v>

503
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like Super Dave.</v>

504
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 1>But in silver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

505
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.930

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's these guys that are just so</v>

508
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:03.580

<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncut,</v>

510
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I like because at the time I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck a South Park </v>

512
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 1>how they're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I go into the premier and all I</v>

513
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 1>could think of was this is the most punk</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock thing I've ever seen in my life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I shit on your God.</v>

516
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that they got away with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they had Saddam Hussein and the </v>

517
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.580
<v Speaker 1>devil and that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penis when they first cost.</v>

518
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Remember when you first heard like </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartening say fuck or something like </v>

<v Speaker 1>world police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took them in another direction,</v>

523
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.520
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one of my favorite all time </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

529
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm watching alone.</v>

530
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I need to watch with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I watched it I thought it</v>

531
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 1>was the funniest thing I've ever seen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life by a long shot.</v>

532
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:08.440

<v Speaker 1>throws up all over himself and throw up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was the scene in the car is going </v>

<v Speaker 1>You're really to have to blow.</v>

540

<v Speaker 1>the ticket?</v>

<v Speaker 1>She shits of his chest.</v>

544
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Sensors will like enough already about </v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship.</v>

545
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

546
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it was just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

547
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

548
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also they're very savvy and</v>

549
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:52.771
<v Speaker 1>they understand the system that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put so many things in order to get </v>

550
00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:56.341
<v Speaker 1>what you actually want so they feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the sensors feel like they've done </v>

551
00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 1>their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an episode of News Radio about</v>

552
00:22:57.281 --> 00:22:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the word penis and because of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>

553
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:04.981
<v Speaker 1>this episode had like 30 uses of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word penis in and they wouldn't air it </v>

554
00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:09.450
<v Speaker 1>one season and we had to wait until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequent season before they started </v>

555
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:09.450
<v Speaker 1>airing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet you remember that?</v>

556
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

557
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:13.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was still a negotiation.</v>

558
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 1>They had wanted the number of penises </v>
<v Speaker 1>removed.</v>

559
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:21.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the premise of the story was bill </v>

560
00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:24.811
<v Speaker 1>saying that you have to say a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>penises in order to be able to say one </v>

561
00:23:24.811 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 1>or two compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally,</v>

562
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>they're like letting everyone in on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google and these fuckers still do it.</v>

563
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these network people are still there.</v>

564
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.380
<v Speaker 1>You're saying it too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.810
<v Speaker 1>If you can say penis once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you say it a thousand times?</v>

566
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's relevant,</v>

567
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>if it's not like what are you trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull off by saying it over and over </v>

568
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

569
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I have bronchitis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

570
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 1>You have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have children.</v>

571
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 3>And when my daughter will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why is it,</v>

572
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 3>why is it okay to say poor but not shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

573
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.280
<v Speaker 3>And my only answer is because most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people in the world are stupid,</v>

574
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.740
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

575
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 3>there's no other explanation for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean the same thing,</v>

576
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.150
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I say like,</v>

577
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>

578
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all words are supposed to do is convey a</v>

579
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 3>meaning and if the meaning is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the words are the same.</v>

580
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

581
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.780
<v Speaker 2>we have a rear really weird thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this culture in this country and this </v>

582
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.960
<v Speaker 2>culture where we're sensitive to secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

583
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secret special words were very sensitive</v>

584
00:24:19.301 --> 00:24:22.570
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's faggot or nigger or,</v>

585
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.610
<v Speaker 2>or shit or it's all should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be no magical words that </v>

586
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.770
<v Speaker 2>have super power for good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck word,</v>

588
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.260
<v Speaker 2>which is like this sort of like sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable,</v>

589
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:39.400
<v Speaker 2>like not even that bad anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>casual conversation,</v>

590
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

591
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.360
<v Speaker 2>all this fucking guy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you don't use it too much,</v>

592
00:24:43.361 --> 00:24:46.510
<v Speaker 2>people don't really seem to care as </v>
<v Speaker 2>businessmen will say it in meetings,</v>

593
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.100
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

594
00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:49.060
<v Speaker 2>But children.</v>

595
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we still send them to school and </v>

596
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:54.930
<v Speaker 3>tell them,</v>

597
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.660
<v Speaker 2>pretend this still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was that these words are bad.</v>

598
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.990
<v Speaker 2>There was a photo that I talked about on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast the other day.</v>

599
00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this on stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so ridiculous.</v>

600
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.410
<v Speaker 2>It was a Mexican drug killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chop this guy up into a bunch of pieces,</v>

601
00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:12.411
<v Speaker 2>skinned him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took his skin off of his face like a </v>

602
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:12.411
<v Speaker 2>mask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hung it on a stick.</v>

603
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.750
<v Speaker 2>All of this is on the air and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut his hands off inside.</v>

604
00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:19.230
<v Speaker 2>One of his hands was his dick and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls and it was blurred out.</v>

605
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that.</v>

606
00:25:20.491 --> 00:25:22.860
<v Speaker 3>All I can think is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people say Mexicans are lazy.</v>

607
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't see a white killer taking the </v>

608
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

609
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.160
<v Speaker 2>He said that he sent a very clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>message and so did the owners of the </v>

610
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.880
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That balls are scary,</v>

611
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.510
<v Speaker 2>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Skin skulls and hands,</v>

612
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

613
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:46.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong with us?</v>

614
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we look at things that way?</v>

615
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Like the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter,</v>

616
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 2>she's taken to saying shit when things </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go well,</v>

617
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 2>which was what happens when she hears </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

618
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll imitate their atmosphere.</v>

619
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.310
<v Speaker 2>My wife was horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

620
00:25:58.311 --> 00:25:59.920
<v Speaker 2>if we stopped now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll stop too.</v>

621
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.550
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what?</v>

622
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:06.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just taking a break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just taking a break for 10 years and </v>

623
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.750
<v Speaker 2>she's gonna start saying shit again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody else.</v>

624
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Like why can't you say it's cute as </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>

625
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:08.150
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

626
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.660
<v Speaker 3>I just told my daughter just just don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it at school because there's no </v>

627
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.840
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I keep saying it's not like there's </v>

628
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.550
<v Speaker 3>any reason for you not to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cool other than the fact that </v>

629
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:18.550
<v Speaker 3>you'll get grief from people.</v>

630
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It's truly amazing that we grew up </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing they were silly and now we're </v>

631
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.990
<v Speaker 2>adults and still silly and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching children and they're going to.</v>

632
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:28.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like this meme takes forever to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of our system.</v>

633
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.740
<v Speaker 2>This forbidden word meme now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

634
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Why is it still here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it's absolutely ridiculous,</v>

635
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.120
<v Speaker 2>we could eliminate so much and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>convey the exact same thoughts.</v>

636
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.360
<v Speaker 2>If we had no bad words that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have come on television and everyone </v>

637
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 2>will just get used to it and it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

638
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.240
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

639
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.860
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would make people angry,</v>

640
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.980
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't cause crime across the border </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the United States.</v>

641
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I think they will confiscate the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from your lexicon if you read it in</v>

642
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 2>order to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have three different pages,</v>

643
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 2>right sir?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you carrying the word continue your </v>

644
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.721
<v Speaker 2>brain now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just started to do standup </v>

645
00:27:08.721 --> 00:27:11.210
<v Speaker 2>recently of a fascinating thing to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I always thought you'd be a </v>

646
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.651
<v Speaker 2>brilliant standup because you're a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer and when we used to do those </v>

647
00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:15.651
<v Speaker 2>little things in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember wearing,</v>

648
00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would talk to the audience before you</v>

649
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 2>would fuck around with them every now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then and you wouldn't like do it.</v>

650
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Like Phil had a routine that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

651
00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:27.671
<v Speaker 2>like Phil actually started doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of wanting to entertain the </v>

652
00:27:27.671 --> 00:27:32.091
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had a bunch of bits that he would </v>

653
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:32.091
<v Speaker 2>do like Clinton impressions and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were really good and it was like,</v>

654
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

655
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:34.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real comic.</v>

656
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a standup is like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about to get up there.</v>

657
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Phil was like this really unusual human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

658
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fascinating guy.</v>

659
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the world.</v>

660
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.800
<v Speaker 2>He was a great hobbyist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

661
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.730
<v Speaker 2>he would go so deep he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got into flying and which is actually</v>

662
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.740
<v Speaker 2>how I found out about this neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Phil was taking me out into the valley </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for different places where he </v>

664
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.821
<v Speaker 2>could go and have a nice view and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>went up in this little single engine </v>

665
00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:05.631
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember when he first started </v>

666
00:28:05.631 --> 00:28:07.461
<v Speaker 2>getting into the flying boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was reading book after book in </v>

667
00:28:07.461 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 2>between rehearsals.</v>

668
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.950
<v Speaker 2>He'd be studying his pilots book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the little fake broadcast </v>

669
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 2>booth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>

670
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 2>He was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very disciplined.</v>

671
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:20.440
<v Speaker 2>He would say Phil was like a big league </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of Mark Mckinney from kids in </v>

672
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 2>the hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really into his flight simulator.</v>

673
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Phil learned to fly a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loved it.</v>

674
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.610
<v Speaker 2>He learned to fly a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He learned to sail a boat.</v>

675
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.070
<v Speaker 2>He was one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

676
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.000
<v Speaker 2>he's only had learned to duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my will not even if you learn to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate from fucking crazy people I </v>

<v Speaker 2>about divorce.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you gotta get Outta that man.</v>

682
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:50.850

<v Speaker 2>wife and she was saying the creepiest </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and insulting him and talking about</v>

689
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 2>was younger and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that you would have just.</v>

696
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:23.670

<v Speaker 2>The thought of being separated from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

699
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 2>which I understand because at the time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was separated from my kids.</v>

700
00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

701
00:29:30.881 --> 00:29:35.881
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely see where he was coming </v>

702
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:35.881
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want a divorce.</v>

703
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 2>He thought his wife is with all her </v>
<v Speaker 2>flaws,</v>

704
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>was still very good to the kids and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

705
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:43.761
<v Speaker 2>and he felt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like he could work it out and then </v>

706
00:29:43.761 --> 00:29:43.761
<v Speaker 2>he really got into pot,</v>

707
00:29:43.761 --> 00:29:43.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was his thing.</v>

708
00:29:43.761 --> 00:29:45.030
<v Speaker 1>He would just get these later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sitting in his Mercedes in the </v>

710
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.410
<v Speaker 1>parking space with his one hitter to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gills stone and you weren't smoking weed</v>

711
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:57.931
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He imagined smoking weed with Phil </v>

712
00:29:57.931 --> 00:29:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Hartman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would barely use.</v>

713
00:29:57.931 --> 00:29:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:29:57.931 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do any drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just get drunk.</v>

715
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So I would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

716
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

717
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:01.790
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

718
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my old thinking.</v>

719
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of thinking leftover from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts competition days.</v>

720
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It came to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pot was one of the worst for motivation.</v>

721
00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last thing I wanted in life was to </v>

722
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.041
<v Speaker 1>be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I wanted to be with </v>

723
00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:20.041
<v Speaker 1>someone who just couldn't get their shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>together was lazy.</v>

724
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.900
<v Speaker 1>And I knew so many people that were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

725
00:30:22.901 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 1>With marijuana is I'd always associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with losers.</v>

726
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your focus dealt a little.</v>

727
00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You help them to honestly,</v>

728
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is here to calm the savage </v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts of man,</v>

729
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially certain men,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very good to me.</v>

731
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:41.290

<v Speaker 1>found.</v>

732
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's why me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just turns me into a sponge.</v>

733
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

<v Speaker 1>show that you really should try it when </v>

739
00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:01.230
<v Speaker 1>That's great to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But drunk on an airplane riding is </v>

<v Speaker 2>you were getting divorced while we were </v>

789
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:06.371
<v Speaker 2>doing the show and it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest things I've ever seen in my </v>

790
00:33:06.371 --> 00:33:08.960
<v Speaker 2>life and not just to Phil Hartman </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorced thing scared me,</v>

791
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:13.961
<v Speaker 2>but dave thing scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why dave scenes </v>

792
00:33:13.961 --> 00:33:16.900
<v Speaker 2>thing scared me was you do not want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get fucking married in Canada because </v>

793
00:33:17.241 --> 00:33:22.241
<v Speaker 2>when you break up in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you decide you want to get a </v>

794
00:33:22.241 --> 00:33:24.821
<v Speaker 2>divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't legally get divorced until </v>

795
00:33:24.821 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 2>you're separate for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

797
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.610

<v Speaker 2>I believe it was a year.</v>

798
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.620
<v Speaker 2>It's tattooed in my brain because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember thinking how crazy this was </v>

799
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.840
<v Speaker 2>that you were fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was happening was his wife,</v>

800
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:40.870
<v Speaker 2>his first wife was at accenture </v>
<v Speaker 2>character and she decided to start </v>

801
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:44.780

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.480
<v Speaker 2>So whenever Dave wanted to see his kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to have to get fucking malaria </v>

816
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:25.480
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

817
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one time we were at one of these NBC </v>

818
00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:31.961
<v Speaker 2>things and Dave's fucked up on malaria </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication and gin and tonics or </v>

819
00:34:31.961 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you were drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

820
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>And you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy.</v>

821
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I had to stop Dave from beating a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

822
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I had to step in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the big guy with the </v>

823
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 2>long hair with the fucking dawn job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Tony carry it.</v>

824
00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't I really liked and wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy had done anything wrong.</v>

825
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 2>It was just the malaria medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become a psychotic.</v>

826
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a very common uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

827
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Especially apparently when you mix it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with alcohol.</v>

828
00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

829
00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 3>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you add to that,</v>

830
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.790
<v Speaker 3>having made two trips to Africa in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

831
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and see his fucking kids,</v>

832
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.640
<v Speaker 3>like I had to fly to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to fly to Morocco at Thanksgiving.</v>

833
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.360
<v Speaker 3>And so we have two weeks off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I floated,</v>

834
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.640
<v Speaker 3>flew to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this again.</v>

835
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.060
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we first separated,</v>

836
00:35:16.061 --> 00:35:21.061
<v Speaker 3>she took the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We said we'd like a summerset mom </v>

837
00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:21.061
<v Speaker 3>divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like I need to take the children</v>

838
00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:24.730
<v Speaker 3>to the continent and gather my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she traveled through Europe with,</v>

839
00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a six month old baby and a two year,</v>

840
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.370
<v Speaker 3>two and a half year old for six months </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

841
00:35:30.371 --> 00:35:34.120
<v Speaker 3>so then Thanksgiving there and Morocco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had to go meet him in Morocco.</v>

842
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 3>So I get spent 10 days in Morocco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then another 24 hours flying back and </v>

843
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 3>then two weeks later we get our </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christmas break.</v>

844
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 3>So I have to fly to Zimbabwe and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing you could've done,</v>

845
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 3>like taking your money and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

846
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving it to joe or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

847
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a old money.</v>

848
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

849
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're responsible for taking care of </v>

850
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 1>their wellbeing at the time when I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I made her get out</v>

851
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.970
<v Speaker 3>the therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a,</v>

852
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:04.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forced her to get us to get into </v>

853
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:04.050
<v Speaker 3>couples therapy because I was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

854
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so since we got this,</v>

855
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go to therapy.</v>

856
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:07.630
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

857
00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

858
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 3>you can go see the therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she goes in and explains to the </v>

859
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.080
<v Speaker 3>therapist that I'm an abusive husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

860
00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she starts asked,</v>

861
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>she asked me being physically abusive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she starts like phoning my </v>

862
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.700
<v Speaker 3>family and friends and saying that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically abusive,</v>

863
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.700
<v Speaker 1>complete fabrications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

864
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So she's just creating a good friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

865
00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Steve Hibbert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he heard this</v>

866
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.560
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

867
00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:37.180
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if dave was abusive,</v>

868
00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.500
<v Speaker 3>she would be dead.</v>

869
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

870
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:43.940
<v Speaker 1>but then I go into</v>

871
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.680
<v Speaker 3>therapy and the therapist goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

872
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.290
<v Speaker 3>who is prepared for this abusive husband</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to walk in.</v>

873
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.660
<v Speaker 3>And she goes and she explained to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>

874
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 3>she said it was very weird because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked in and you didn't match the </v>

875
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.040
<v Speaker 3>description of you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said when you walked in.</v>

876
00:36:57.041 --> 00:36:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw you two together.</v>

877
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.760
<v Speaker 3>I immediately realized that if anyone in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this couple was abused,</v>

878
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:02.840
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

879
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it was me.</v>

880
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Did the therapist say this to her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

881
00:37:07.131 --> 00:37:09.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she ever said it to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>in therapy.</v>

882
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a one on one with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy?</v>

883
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I had one on one with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both saw her</v>

884
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:17.670
<v Speaker 3>individually and together and then after</v>
<v Speaker 3>a six months of therapy,</v>

885
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

886
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I thought things were starting to </v>

887
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.091
<v Speaker 3>get better because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was able to do things like go CD </v>

888
00:37:26.091 --> 00:37:26.560
<v Speaker 3>shopping with Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

889
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:31.580
<v Speaker 3>without getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without that being a huge fight when I </v>

890
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:31.580
<v Speaker 3>got home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

891
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was like,</v>

892
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit of freedom here.</v>

893
00:37:34.171 --> 00:37:39.171
<v Speaker 3>I can go out and hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang out with my friends for a little </v>

894
00:37:39.171 --> 00:37:40.290
<v Speaker 3>bit without there being a huge fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

895
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.880
<v Speaker 3>but then she was diagnosed as having </v>
<v Speaker 3>borderline personality disorder.</v>

896
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.470
<v Speaker 1>They're not exactly mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is it borderline personality </v>

897
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.470
<v Speaker 1>disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a misnomer.</v>

898
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Really don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to,</v>

899
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:56.950
<v Speaker 3>they used to think it was because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a condition that bordered on being </v>

900
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 3>psychotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

901
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.020
<v Speaker 3>and now it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's they know,</v>

902
00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:02.780
<v Speaker 3>that isn't the condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not anything to do with psychosis,</v>

903
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.750
<v Speaker 3>but the name has stuck.</v>

904
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem with my problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name is when you say borderline </v>

905
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.841
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a fucking personality </v>

906
00:38:13.841 --> 00:38:13.841
<v Speaker 1>disorder or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is borderline?</v>

907
00:38:13.841 --> 00:38:17.450
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of weird because in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borderline's,</v>

908
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:22.510
<v Speaker 1>a lot of therapists don't even treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because they think they're just </v>

909
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.360
<v Speaker 1>impossible to treat and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible people to deal with.</v>

910
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.760
<v Speaker 1>You know that they're incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest.</v>

911
00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:28.910
<v Speaker 1>The pathological liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you define it though?</v>

912
00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:31.670
<v Speaker 1>How can you define certain sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness?</v>

913
00:38:31.671 --> 00:38:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

914
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.030
<v Speaker 1>is it a judgment call?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a,</v>

915
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.340
<v Speaker 1>was it the DSM?</v>

916
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The diagnostic standards manual or </v>

917
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's got like a checklist and if you</v>

918
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 3>score a certain number on the checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

919
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 3>that's a diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

920
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:52.291
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had like nine out of 10 on the </v>

921
00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:56.611
<v Speaker 3>checklist for borderline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was she always this way or did she </v>

922
00:38:56.611 --> 00:38:56.680
<v Speaker 3>change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was always that way.</v>

923
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.880
<v Speaker 3>She was out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

924
00:38:57.881 --> 00:38:59.730
<v Speaker 3>like basically as soon as we became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple,</v>

925
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.310
<v Speaker 3>like before we're couple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was my,</v>

926
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before she did,</v>

927
00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 3>she was my best friend's girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>

928
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Karma son.</v>

929
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>

930
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got hooked up with Karma and so,</v>

931
00:39:11.281 --> 00:39:13.050
<v Speaker 3>so it was like one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

932
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.350
<v Speaker 3>she break up with him first and then go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out with you.</v>

933
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

934
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of those things where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of said,</v>

935
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:22.531
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we should stop hanging out so </v>

936
00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:22.531
<v Speaker 3>much because um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

937
00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I was like feeling bad about it again.</v>

938
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I was like 20 years old and at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point kind of lonely and desperate and </v>

939
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

940
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I've got these feelings and we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop hanging out together alone.</v>

941
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You actually said I have these feelings </v>

942
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:36.480
<v Speaker 3>and we should stop hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

943
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.490
<v Speaker 3>you guys would do the very few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

944
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.720
<v Speaker 3>And her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her reaction to that was the uh,</v>

945
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 3>she just showed me her tits and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>kissing me.</v>

946
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.110
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

947
00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:45.360
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

948
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did give it your best.</v>

949
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

950
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 3>so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go to the buddy and go,</v>

951
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.830
<v Speaker 3>hey bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck your girlfriend again.</v>

952
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to cool it,</v>

953
00:39:56.501 --> 00:40:01.501
<v Speaker 3>tried to get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I even was out of town for awhile </v>

954
00:40:01.501 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 3>and tried to stay away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

955
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was probably like,</v>

956
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 3>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

957
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing is I didn't </v>

958
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:10.530
<v Speaker 3>realize at the time because I've gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

959
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.880
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought things were okay with them </v>

960
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

961
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

962
00:40:14.251 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't until she and I hooked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

963
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as we hook,</v>

964
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.180
<v Speaker 3>because borderlines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they love you,</v>

965
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 3>you're the most beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect thing in the world.</v>

966
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

967
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 3>but then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if anything is wrong,</v>

968
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.230
<v Speaker 3>then you suddenly become the most evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark,</v>

969
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:31.600
<v Speaker 3>horrible thing in the world and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>

970
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:36.780
<v Speaker 3>they can't see the two at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't see your flaws and your and </v>

971
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 3>your virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

972
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I think I've dated somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every girl you like,</v>

973
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to write this fucking guy.</v>

974
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even know he just got out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with a penthouse pet of the</v>

975
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.150
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

976
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 3>real it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was wonderful for me.</v>

977
00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:51.400
<v Speaker 3>It was like I had my own soap opera </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

978
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.960
<v Speaker 3>but it was also just like this where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

979
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.570
<v Speaker 3>when Shit went down,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was no like shuts down.</v>

981
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can work through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

982
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.120
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the key signals of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>borderline,</v>

983
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

984
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:09.241
<v Speaker 3>that in the they say it's the inability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to recognize the good and bad in the </v>

985
00:41:09.241 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 3>same person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

986
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.340

1022
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've offered,</v>

1023
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 1>which is risk you should take for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

1024
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay at my house.</v>

1025
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin stayed at my house for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months after he got out.</v>

1026
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to tell people like,</v>

1027
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:36.791
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck and you think for some </v>

1028
00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:36.791
<v Speaker 1>reason or other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is a part of your life.</v>

1029
00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1030
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a show that you're tuning into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the you can shut off.</v>

1031
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.450
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like this.</v>

1032
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guilt about how we started the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

1033
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

1034
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

1035
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost as crazy as she is after 11 </v>

1036
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 1>years of no fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain doesn't function properly,</v>

1037
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also 11 years of like twice a </v>

1038
00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suicide threats,</v>

1039
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1040
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.440
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got to the point where I was </v>

1041
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:07.440
<v Speaker 1>so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1042
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:07.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least if we have a kid,</v>

1043
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have a kid,</v>

1044
00:43:08.611 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 1>she won't kill herself when I leave.</v>

1045
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That's how crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And literally within less than a month </v>

1046
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 1>after my son was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1047
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 1>out of nowhere she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even thinking about it.</v>

1048
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you left me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with a baby,</v>

1049
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I would still kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so you could read my mind.</v>

1050
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about it.</v>

1051
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dave?</v>

1054
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Some really eyeopening moments on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

1055
00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I learned so much about all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of relationships hanging</v>

1056
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>out with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1057
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.780

<v Speaker 1>Lena.</v>

1063
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Lena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1064
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.930
<v Speaker 1>You're sort of married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of whatever it was.</v>

1065
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:07.820
<v Speaker 1>They might've jumped over a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>broom,</v>

1066
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:12.821
<v Speaker 1>like unreads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it actually made it to </v>

1067
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the courtroom and time to sign papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

1068
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many relationships are right?</v>

1069
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are together,</v>

1070
00:44:19.851 --> 00:44:24.851
<v Speaker 1>but I remember being startled when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all came back from hiatus and the only </v>

1071
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:30.131
<v Speaker 1>one who was divorced was a steve route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we thought you were happy.</v>

1072
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I know he got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard</v>

1073
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.220
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's another one that I learned from </v>

1074
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:37.220
<v Speaker 4>when Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve,</v>

1075
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.801
<v Speaker 4>his entire life as a working actor who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a brilliant actor but had done like a </v>

1076
00:44:39.801 --> 00:44:43.840
<v Speaker 4>lot of very small things and never </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten any notoriety until newsradio.</v>

1077
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was really struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe he said he had never made more</v>

1078
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:52.821
<v Speaker 4>than 50 or $60,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>in an entire year ever before news </v>

1079
00:44:52.821 --> 00:44:56.811
<v Speaker 4>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden he does news radio </v>

1080
00:44:56.811 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 4>and he's making really good money and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then his wife gets a divorce and expects</v>

1081
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 4>to be paid for half the length of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship,</v>

1082
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:05.841
<v Speaker 4>the money he's making now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she just got instantly use like </v>

1083
00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 4>within a couple months this new </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle and he was giving her $10,000</v>

1084
00:45:08.941 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 4>a month and going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1085
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 4>I remember just seeing him just couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>really pay for,</v>

1086
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lived in a small apartment,</v>

1087
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 4>was fucking struggling with trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put it together</v>

1088
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:21.880
<v Speaker 3>at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1089
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.130
<v Speaker 3>when?</v>

<v Speaker 3>month and that was before we had.</v>

1091
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.000
<v Speaker 3>That was before we had it like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>separation agreement.</v>

1092
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Half a million a year.</v>

1098
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 3>to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be heard though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>didn't like where the Koi pond was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1105
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.660
<v Speaker 3>like you can't really raise a child in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy home without a collective.</v>

1106
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:09.710
<v Speaker 3>That was at her argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their argument and it was all for the </v>

<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Kids need to go to Morocco.</v>

1109
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Worry about getting bitten by a </v>

1110
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.251
<v Speaker 3>poisonous insects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She turned like the third issue kept </v>

1111
00:46:18.251 --> 00:46:18.860
<v Speaker 3>renovating this house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like least spent like another,</v>

1112
00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.360
<v Speaker 3>like a half a million dollars renovating</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1113
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:21.380
<v Speaker 3>fully renovated house.</v>

1114
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.930
<v Speaker 4>It's just so straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1115
00:46:22.931 --> 00:46:27.931
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm married now and I think about the </v>

1116
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:29.560
<v Speaker 4>legal ramifications of that and I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a prenuptial and all that stuff and</v>

1117
00:46:29.561 --> 00:46:34.561
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I absolutely think that marriage is </v>

1118
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:34.561
<v Speaker 4>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still think it's retarded,</v>

1119
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:36.220
<v Speaker 4>but Mrs Rogan doesn't know and I love </v>
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>

1120
00:46:36.221 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 4>so I was willing to do it for because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's crazy,</v>

1121
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:43.621
<v Speaker 4>but got it everywhere around me is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with bullet holes in their heads </v>

1122
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.350
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm saying I don't think I </v>
<v Speaker 4>should put this gun in my mouth.</v>

1123
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trust me,</v>

1124
00:46:48.641 --> 00:46:51.430
<v Speaker 4>it'll be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like,</v>

1125
00:46:51.431 --> 00:46:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I just see the remanence of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of divorce everywhere is constantly.</v>

1126
00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 4>The legal idea of it is just so it seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>so ridiculous that you would get two </v>

1127
00:47:01.781 --> 00:47:06.781
<v Speaker 4>people in a relationship and force them </v>
<v Speaker 4>either to be together or to distribute </v>

1128
00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:08.140
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1129
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.600
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

1130
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrified to get married just </v>

1131
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.950
<v Speaker 3>because my own parents getting a divorce</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just stories like this.</v>

1132
00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:20.951
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm scared as fuck my parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>not getting a divorce was equally </v>

1133
00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 3>terrifying was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1135
00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.670
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1136
00:47:25.671 --> 00:47:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been divorced twice now,</v>

1137
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went it on both ends,</v>

1138
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went back into it after all that you</v>

1139
00:47:31.991 --> 00:47:33.600
<v Speaker 2>went back and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1140
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:34.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker,</v>

1141
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1142
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really.</v>

1143
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe in marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>

1144
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.700
<v Speaker 2>but the US is not set up for you not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be married if you're Canadian.</v>

1145
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or no.</v>

1146
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Even I think even for Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1147
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real civil union.</v>

1148
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1149
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:48.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1150
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:53.370

<v Speaker 2>So you're worried about like if you had </v>

1151
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:53.370
<v Speaker 2>to go to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't come visit you.</v>

1152
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.241
<v Speaker 2>That's actually seemed like she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she almost died in an emergency </v>

1153
00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 2>ward wants and I couldn't get any </v>
<v Speaker 2>information about her and I couldn't see</v>

1154
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.210
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1155
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.430
<v Speaker 2>because you weren't married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this country is weird,</v>

1159
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's not weird because how would </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know if she's in a coma?</v>

1160

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1163
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:19.201
<v Speaker 2>unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually the husband that you're </v>

1164
00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:22.021
<v Speaker 2>the current boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be the ex boyfriend and still </v>

1165
00:48:22.021 --> 00:48:24.480
<v Speaker 2>trying to get her back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see why in that </v>

1166
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:24.480
<v Speaker 2>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

1167
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.230
<v Speaker 2>why if you're gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gay marriage,</v>

1168
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:27.430
<v Speaker 2>not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just some.</v>

1169
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Something similar to get into marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's to me one of the most </v>

1170
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.811
<v Speaker 2>fascinating arguments and immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>labels you a retard in my book if you </v>

1171
00:48:36.811 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 2>think that it's a bad idea that gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>people shouldn't be married.</v>

1172
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:44.161
<v Speaker 2>I think all marriage is a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with gay marriage is no worse </v>

1173
00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 2>than straight marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you not?</v>

1174
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:50.041
<v Speaker 2>One people will start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes and all I hear is I'm gay and I'm </v>

1175
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:54.890
<v Speaker 2>hiding it or I'm scared of being gay or </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm humbled that that's all I.</v>

1176
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of things that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage is going to hurt their </v>

1178
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.200
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1179
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.200
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that he has,</v>

1180
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 2>it's going to devalue like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1181
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:04.160
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to flood the market </v>
<v Speaker 2>with marriage.</v>

1182
00:49:04.161 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not that Fox show who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>marry a millionaire or anything.</v>

1183
00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1184
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Stories like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>housewives of Beverly Hills,</v>

1185
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything devalues marriage.</v>

1186
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a reality show about flavor.</v>

1187
00:49:17.411 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Flave getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1188
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.030
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.400
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody protested.</v>

1190
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.630
<v Speaker 2>This is devalued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd show up at that rally.</v>

1191
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:25.870
<v Speaker 2>There was two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1192
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.170
<v Speaker 2>there's two guys that I know that live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in down the street and they're okay.</v>

1193
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:31.120
<v Speaker 2>And they have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They adopted it.</v>

1194
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.180
<v Speaker 2>They actually didn't adopt a kid stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>combined their sperm together and hired </v>

1195
00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:41.821
<v Speaker 2>someone to carry their baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first woman changed her mind </v>

1196
00:49:41.821 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 2>right after they had paid for everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>and took care of her for nine months and</v>

1197
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 2>gave her a salary and the baby comes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she goes,</v>

1198
00:49:47.831 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to keep it.</v>

1199
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.680
<v Speaker 2>And they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like they,</v>

1200
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.930
<v Speaker 2>they had spent like hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars.</v>

1201
00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:57.931
<v Speaker 2>They had given her a salary for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire year and then they had spent all </v>

1202
00:49:57.931 --> 00:50:01.411
<v Speaker 2>this money in medical procedures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken care of all of her medical bills </v>

1203
00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end she's like,</v>

1204
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:02.930
<v Speaker 2>psych.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1205
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:07.950
<v Speaker 2>my kid just took it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they went through the whole </v>

1206
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:11.221
<v Speaker 2>process again and then had a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there wasn't any kind of like court </v>

1207
00:50:11.221 --> 00:50:13.630
<v Speaker 2>thing they could've done or contracts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing you can do.</v>

1208
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 2>It's her baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes out of her body.</v>

1209
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't take her baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot tell.</v>

1210
00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 2>But there should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1211
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 2>we're giving you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money shouldn't be really.</v>

1212
00:50:20.021 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to pay it back and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sperm and there shouldn't be,</v>

1213
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1214
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what she did was,</v>

1215
00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably deceptive maybe,</v>

1216
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:32.750
<v Speaker 2>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe she just changed her mind.</v>

1217
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:37.750
<v Speaker 2>She was overwhelmed by emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't believe that the idea that </v>

1218
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.160
<v Speaker 2>she's going to leave this kid behind in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and just go about it.</v>

1219
00:50:38.161 --> 00:50:43.161
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see her point of view more than I see </v>

1220
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:45.581
<v Speaker 2>their point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely did was shoot a load and a </v>

1221
00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:45.581
<v Speaker 2>spend some money and you have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1222
00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What ultimately when it comes down to </v>

1223
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:50.290
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't say goodbye to that baby,</v>

1224
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't say goodbye to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1225
00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:56.981
<v Speaker 2>seeing my wife have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the baby come out of her body </v>

1226
00:50:56.981 --> 00:50:58.350
<v Speaker 2>being there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment the baby's born,</v>

1227
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 2>seeing the bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing this,</v>

1228
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this moment.</v>

1229
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take the baby away.</v>

1230
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.470
<v Speaker 2>The baby has to be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you'd take the baby away,</v>

1231
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it has to be some crazy math head or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad person.</v>

1232
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the only way she'd take </v>
<v Speaker 2>her baby away and it's like,</v>

1233
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 2>this is our nature bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a soul stealing bond.</v>

1234
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy and his ex girlfriend was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

1235
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.160
<v Speaker 2>She was a stripper when she was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a baby and gave it up for </v>

1236
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 2>prostitutes or for adoption rather for </v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitution and can you do that?</v>

1237
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.500
<v Speaker 2>You decide so early in Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find them nice pimp and she was.</v>

1238
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 2>This poor girl was wrecked for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of her life.</v>

1239
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 2>She was devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever she would drink,</v>

1240
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:41.291
<v Speaker 2>whenever she would be out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would just think about that baby </v>

1241
00:51:41.291 --> 00:51:42.050
<v Speaker 2>that she had when she was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that it's out there in the world and</v>

1242
00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:47.051
<v Speaker 2>that she's the mother and she just has </v>
<v Speaker 2>this hole in her soul forever and she </v>

1243
00:51:47.051 --> 00:51:48.870
<v Speaker 2>couldn't make up no matter what she did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't fill it up with drugs.</v>

1244
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't fill it out with Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't figure out.</v>

1245
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.350
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't fill it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just as a whole that.</v>

1246
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 2>And so these poor guys down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.770
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spent the money but they have </v>

1248
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:01.770
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be fun.</v>

1249
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:01.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got ripped off.</v>

1250
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:01.770
<v Speaker 2>No big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.490
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they now they have a kid.</v>

1252
00:52:03.491 --> 00:52:08.491
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating though because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid is starting to get a little </v>

1253
00:52:08.491 --> 00:52:08.491
<v Speaker 2>older now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like four or five,</v>

1254
00:52:08.491 --> 00:52:12.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now when I see him he's trying to </v>

1255
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.670
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck is my mother?</v>

1256
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else has a lady around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two dudes all the time.</v>

1257
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.240
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure it's pretty weird for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is everything so tiny?</v>

1258
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
<v Speaker 2>It's fashion sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what happens with gay guys when </v>

1259
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.000
<v Speaker 2>they get divorced?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

1260
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you decide who's the wife,</v>

1261
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

1262
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.610
<v Speaker 2>is it who's working and who's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ones would you want to,</v>

1263
00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.620
<v Speaker 2>but as tight in the bud is tighter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>looser?</v>

1264
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:44.510
<v Speaker 2>That never understood the whole top and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom thing that I was gay.</v>

1265
00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be versatile.</v>

1266
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Move it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you not,</v>

1267
00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give and receive it and I don't </v>

1268
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 2>understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How rude.</v>

1269
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some gay guys liked the rude </v>

1270
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 2>guys though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we just want to shut up,</v>

1271
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.890
<v Speaker 2>get smacked him in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then run out the door and that's what </v>

1272
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:01.890
<v Speaker 2>they're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking for some weird,</v>

1273
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.350
<v Speaker 2>abusive sort of a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't.</v>

1274
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I just can't understand me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1308
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.140
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing about that.</v>

1309
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Been such an awesome game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't played because I don't play </v>

1310
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.101
<v Speaker 1>any video games because I don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for the longest time you did the </v>

1311
00:54:46.101 --> 00:54:46.470
<v Speaker 1>poker show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1312
00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And so after news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do after news radio?</v>

1313
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Did you try to develop something else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had like three or four development deals</v>

1314
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:58.131
<v Speaker 1>after that wrote about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote like about five pilots for </v>

1315
00:54:58.131 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 1>different networks in different studios </v>
<v Speaker 1>and none of them sold.</v>

1316
00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And that was it then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1317
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Then it was doing a bunch of movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain candy.</v>

1318
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What brain candy,</v>

1319
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:12.291
<v Speaker 1>your shot while we were doing his radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>is another lesson I learned that I have </v>

1320
00:55:12.291 --> 00:55:12.291
<v Speaker 1>to remember before I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1321
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 1>that I learned about the movie business.</v>

1322
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Dave had a fucking great movie called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong guy.</v>

1323
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a great movie and we went to </v>

1324
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Brian Callum went to say it with</v>

1325
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 1>me and we were fucking howling and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1326
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David's going to be a huge movie star.</v>

1327
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:30.550
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a huge movie and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember watching it going like,</v>

1328
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:34.770
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the best comedies I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in years and then nothing.</v>

1329
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney shelved it.</v>

1330
00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what happened was how Hollywood </v>

1331
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.260
<v Speaker 1>pictures was our distributor at Disney </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they shut Hollywood pictures down in</v>

1332
00:55:43.261 --> 00:55:47.130
<v Speaker 1>the middle of production and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done,</v>

1333
00:55:47.131 --> 00:55:52.131
<v Speaker 1>they reopened Hollywood pictures but </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the new president of Hollywood </v>

1334
00:55:52.131 --> 00:55:54.981
<v Speaker 1>pictures and he didn't want to touch any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff that the other guy had </v>

1335
00:55:54.981 --> 00:55:56.960
<v Speaker 1>started a like that because if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1336
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 1>if it's a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their failure.</v>

1337
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the other guy success.</v>

1338
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.110
<v Speaker 1>So they just don't deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they uh,</v>

1339
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Speaker 1>so it got shelved for like five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would even admit they hand it.</v>

1340
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 1>So it never had a theatrical release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never got theatrical release.</v>

1341
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's available on DVD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1342
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Can't get it on Amazon.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10 on Amazon right now.</v>

1343
00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the people should probably </v>

1344
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:20.560
<v Speaker 1>pick that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1345
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pick it up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's one click while we're doing the </v>

1346
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 1>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far that it's actually what I'm.</v>

1347
00:56:22.741 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I'm proudest of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie,</v>

1348
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.220
<v Speaker 1>like creatively comedically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant,</v>

1349
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was eric goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>People love Amazon dogs.</v>

1352
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a brilliant fucking movie.</v>

1353
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed the shit out of it and I </v>

1354
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:41.530
<v Speaker 1>remember you guys all coming out to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that,</v>

1355
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:42.590
<v Speaker 1>that screening and yeah.</v>

1356
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking after is over </v>

1357
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.670
<v Speaker 1>after the whole thing where it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out and it never got.</v>

1358
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1359
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 1>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this business is crazy.</v>

1360
00:56:49.361 --> 00:56:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Like this doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know because we really thought we were</v>

1361
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:53.620
<v Speaker 1>clear because we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:58.650
<v Speaker 1>the big thing was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you're doing an independent </v>

1363
00:56:58.650 --> 00:56:58.650
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get distribution?</v>

1364
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:02.970
<v Speaker 1>And we went into it with distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had Disney lined up in the script </v>

1365
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:03.020
<v Speaker 1>phase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1366
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had distribution lined up.</v>

1367
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:07.420
<v Speaker 1>We had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we even had a,</v>

1368
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.510
<v Speaker 1>we were even in profit in foreign sales </v>
<v Speaker 1>while we were shooting the movie based </v>

1369
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>on a trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1370
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.940
<v Speaker 1>That was taken to can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1371
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

1372
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.960
<v Speaker 1>we had advanced sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign sales that put the movie in </v>

1373
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.931
<v Speaker 1>profit while we were shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were all contingent on a US </v>

1374
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:24.931
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>

1375
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you could get a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and talk to the new head and go retail.</v>

1376
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.050
<v Speaker 1>We tried it for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1378
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.840
<v Speaker 1>talking to Disney for a year and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wouldn't have anything to do with </v>

1381
00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:46.220
<v Speaker 1>buy it from Disney and they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 3>November 20th,</v>

1471
01:01:26.441 --> 01:01:29.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in court and thinking at the end</v>

<v Speaker 3>of that day,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1479
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.700
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was saying they're going,</v>

1480
01:01:51.701 --> 01:01:52.270

<v Speaker 3>dollars and plus the ongoing money that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would accrue over the six months.</v>

1486
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.610

<v Speaker 3>in a month just to pay that.</v>

1504
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1505
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with 20 percent commission,</v>

1506
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:58.180
<v Speaker 3>35 percent tax bracket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1507
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've got to earn $40,000</v>

1508
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.510
<v Speaker 3>just to have $0.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1509
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 3>And it's someone you hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:03:07.111 --> 01:03:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who didn't fuck me for 11 years</v>

1511
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 2>raising ass laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you tell them that you </v>

1512
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.540
<v Speaker 2>don't make that much money anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call the judge</v>

1513
01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.730
<v Speaker 3>pat who made this ruling because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were asking for the six months.</v>

1514
01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:26.731
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the judge kept saying to the fro </v>

1515
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:26.731
<v Speaker 3>attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1516
01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me another option because I'm </v>

1517
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.010
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at the,</v>

1518
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:36.310
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the financial documents and I'm seeing </v>

1519
01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:37.560
<v Speaker 3>where all the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the money that has come in,</v>

1520
01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing where it's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all here in this documents,</v>

1521
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.760
<v Speaker 3>all the money that's come in and where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all gone.</v>

1522
01:03:42.761 --> 01:03:47.761
<v Speaker 3>I can see it all in these documents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I am convinced that there isn't a </v>

1523
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:49.810
<v Speaker 3>half a million dollars from Mr Foley to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with today.</v>

1524
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:55.290
<v Speaker 3>So if you insist on that ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would send them to jail and your </v>

1525
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.690
<v Speaker 3>client will never see another dime </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Mr Foley's career will be over.</v>

1526
01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:01.030
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he kept saying,</v>

1527
01:04:01.031 --> 01:04:03.910
<v Speaker 3>give me an option that will get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>client some money.</v>

1528
01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.300
<v Speaker 3>And the effort refused to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1529
01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:08.980
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the authority from our </v>
<v Speaker 3>client,</v>

1530
01:04:08.981 --> 01:04:11.620
<v Speaker 3>my ex wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make any other offer.</v>

1531
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for about two hours,</v>

1532
01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:17.950
<v Speaker 3>the judge kept asking them to come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with another.</v>

1533
01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:19.840
<v Speaker 2>So all this time when you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1534
01:04:19.841 --> 01:04:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to jail.</v>

1535
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I might be going to jail essentially</v>

1536
01:04:23.321 --> 01:04:24.340
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1537
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1538
01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:31.141
<v Speaker 2>Going to jail for being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the crime of not earning a million </v>

1539
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:31.141
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1540
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So what happens if that actually does </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

1541
01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:37.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have guys gone in jail with a </v>

1542
01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:37.651
<v Speaker 2>large sum like that and never come out,</v>

1543
01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people have definitely gone to jail.</v>

1544
01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:44.291
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and definitely there's a lot of people </v>

1545
01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:44.291
<v Speaker 3>who had been looking at jail time have </v>
<v Speaker 3>just killed themselves.</v>

1546
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

1547
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:48.350
<v Speaker 3>can you get the kids and then have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay with it</v>

1548
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:52.850
<v Speaker 2>so that she has the town one bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's alimony or child support.</v>

1549
01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:54.560
<v Speaker 2>So child support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all child support.</v>

1550
01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still the kids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a month.</v>

1557
01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.950
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:05:15.951 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would talk to the and be like,</v>

1559
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come live</v>

1560
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a TV show together.</v>

1561
01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you a podcast and somehow turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tables.</v>

1562
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1563
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean get a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean get a couple of things about </v>

1564
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>being on the real house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Husbands of Beverly Hills.</v>

1565
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking we can get a reality show </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the ground.</v>

1566
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>What are you willing to marry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Kardashians?</v>

1567
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1568
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I've look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1569
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't marry worse than I have because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd probably be a lot better.</v>

1570
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1571
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 1>They're just ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the solution?</v>

1573
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>So you cannot go to Canada and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>send whatever you have and then you have</v>

1574
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:57.301
<v Speaker 1>to constantly deal with legal payments </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're constantly trying to </v>

1575
01:05:57.301 --> 01:06:00.211
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I spent like a year and a half </v>

1576
01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>literally going to court every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>month with lawyers.</v>

1577
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Just basically having to go to court </v>
<v Speaker 1>every month just to stay out of jail to </v>

1578
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>go and have them put it over to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

1579
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And the lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers,</v>

1580
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

1581
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that do family law,</v>

1582
01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are really horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1583
01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just make money off misery.</v>

1584
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>And even my own lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

1585
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extending this as far as they could </v>

1586
01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:23.820
<v Speaker 1>until I ran out of money and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then quit.</v>

1587
01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>So when I went to court for this ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have,</v>

1588
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a lawyer because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't afford one.</v>

1589
01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:30.430
<v Speaker 1>So you went by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there by myself.</v>

1590
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Not only was out there by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of the documents that had been </v>

1591
01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>piled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the evidence that have been </v>

1592
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>bottled up over the course of a year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half sitting in my lawyers office.</v>

1593
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1594
01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So you had no evidence and no lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you have records?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any side?</v>

1596
01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had nothing.</v>

1597
01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're just going to there nothing.</v>

1598
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I have no money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw I didn't do.</v>

1599
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're asking me questions about </v>

1600
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.670
<v Speaker 1>files that had been piling up over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and a half,</v>

1601
01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.890
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't recall.</v>

1602
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1603
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.460
<v Speaker 1>how do they justify such an exorbitant </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money because it's the,</v>

1604
01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it was explained to me by my lawyers </v>

1605
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.671
<v Speaker 1>was that the courts have a assumption is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the children should continue to </v>

1606
01:07:14.671 --> 01:07:18.091
<v Speaker 1>live at the level they were at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time of the dissolution of the </v>

1607
01:07:18.091 --> 01:07:19.410
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1608
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy because if I were still </v>
<v Speaker 1>married in my income,</v>

1609
01:07:22.361 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 1>dropped their lifestyle would change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because we're not married anymore,</v>

1610
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 1>their lifestyles should never change no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what I'm earning.</v>

1611
01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Was that the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruling that was enforced was by </v>

1612
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:33.690
<v Speaker 1>another judge named judge justice back </v>
<v Speaker 1>outs.</v>

1613
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And she's the one who ruled about three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years ago when I went back to try </v>

1614
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and get it adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

1615
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1616
01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:46.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have a hearing to have it </v>

1617
01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>adjusted to meet my income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1618
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and she ruled against me and in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruling she said my ability to pay was </v>

1619
01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>not relevant to my obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't matter to her what I proved</v>

1620
01:07:55.510 --> 01:08:00.510
<v Speaker 1>my income to be if my income was zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said I was still obligated to pay as</v>

1621
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:03.520
<v Speaker 1>though I was earning a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people saying,</v>

1622
01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully guy's bothering me the fuck out.</v>

1623
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

1624
01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>this is important shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was my education in,</v>

1625
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:14.230
<v Speaker 1>in relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the law regarding relationships</v>

1626
01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:15.840
<v Speaker 1>as I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

1627
01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I was on news radio is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh face boy,</v>

1628
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:23.291
<v Speaker 2>didn't know Jack Shit about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is how I learned about </v>

1629
01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:26.231
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how I learned about the whole </v>

1630
01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>gamut from divorce to fucking murder </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>

1631
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>And I learned it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are happily married.</v>

1632
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1633
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:32.030
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You figured it out.</v>

1634
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of lucky.</v>

1635
01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could go ugly for me to it.</v>

1636
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:40.890
<v Speaker 2>I would do in your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't probably seriously just move </v>

1637
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:42.720
<v Speaker 2>somewhere like live on a beach in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamaica.</v>

1638
01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:44.780
<v Speaker 2>He loves his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to see your kids.</v>

1639
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Not now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't go to Canada so they can't see.</v>

1640
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.130
<v Speaker 3>So you don't see him at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the last time you saw them?</v>

1641
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:53.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in uh,</v>

1642
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.280
<v Speaker 3>November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1643
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.770
<v Speaker 3>That would drive me nuts to my size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went to see my,</v>

1644
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:00.670
<v Speaker 3>my sons play at school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was less than my son.</v>

1645
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Was the trick there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wife?</v>

1646
01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:04.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't there.</v>

1647
01:09:04.711 --> 01:09:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have no communication with her at</v>

1648
01:09:07.021 --> 01:09:07.440
<v Speaker 3>all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1649
01:09:07.441 --> 01:09:07.940
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1650
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:09.660
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to pay any more alimony?</v>

1651
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't seek alimony.</v>

1652
01:09:11.371 --> 01:09:14.550
<v Speaker 3>She sought a shout for it because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.360
<v Speaker 3>But it's none of it got to the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1654
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:19.540
<v Speaker 3>it all goes to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.330
<v Speaker 3>She was getting all this money and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>on top of the child support payment,</v>

1656
01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:29.360
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was also getting something called </v>

1657
01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:29.710
<v Speaker 3>section seven expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just basically anything she chose to</v>

1658
01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:32.400
<v Speaker 3>any bills she chose to run up what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1659
01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:34.980
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be like $20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for summer camp,</v>

1660
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:36.090
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1661
01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Anything that was for the kids that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>chose?</v>

1662
01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not just alimony.</v>

1663
01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:45.171
<v Speaker 2>Not or not just child support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child support plus and then all of her </v>

1664
01:09:45.171 --> 01:09:47.430
<v Speaker 2>living expenses and the mortgage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

1665
01:09:47.431 --> 01:09:48.540
<v Speaker 2>medical expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1666
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.070
<v Speaker 2>It just makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1667
01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 2>it should make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange and I don't know if </v>

1668
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to fix it,</v>

1669
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly should not apply to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something as,</v>

1670
01:09:57.711 --> 01:10:00.840
<v Speaker 2>as crazy and transient as a Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1671
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.470
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1672
01:10:01.471 --> 01:10:06.471
<v Speaker 2>the greatest job ever a sitcom job </v>
<v Speaker 2>because those only last a few years and </v>

1673
01:10:06.471 --> 01:10:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you usually get one of them your whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1674
01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1675
01:10:08.281 --> 01:10:12.090
<v Speaker 2>it's rare as fuck how I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the Stephen Root situation was</v>

1676
01:10:12.091 --> 01:10:13.360
<v Speaker 2>the same situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just,</v>

1677
01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:18.210
<v Speaker 2>he got fucked based on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when he was making the most money</v>

1678
01:10:18.211 --> 01:10:19.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's when she decided to get and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was good.</v>

1679
01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Letting the old assumption that know </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's based on an assumption that's 50 </v>

1681
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.891
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that women can't take care of </v>

1682
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:28.891
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't,</v>

1683
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:28.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1684
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't.</v>

1685
01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1686
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Just pray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pray for breast cancer or not </v>

1687
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:36.930
<v Speaker 2>uncovering this in my standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but humorously.</v>

1688
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that.</v>

1689
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's much more difficult </v>

1690
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:45.300
<v Speaker 2>for women to take care of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially women who have children.</v>

1691
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hardest shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1692
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:48.540
<v Speaker 2>How raising kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1693
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.030
<v Speaker 2>people that don't think that it's our </v>
<v Speaker 2>job to raise kids.</v>

1694
01:10:51.031 --> 01:10:56.031
<v Speaker 2>You never tried to raise kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're talking </v>

1695
01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:56.031
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1696
01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I am amazed lot so many people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's okay or that it's no big deal </v>

1697
01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.290
<v Speaker 2>to have a full time job and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a friend of mine who's 36 </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's still wanting to have kids and </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1700

<v Speaker 2>interrupt her job and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1732
01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1733
01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:30.091
<v Speaker 3>then I also like was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the judge on a thank God you're </v>

1734
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>here with an MBC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would've been a good money gig.</v>

1735
01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:36.810
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an Improv show based on </v>

1736
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Australian Improv show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1737
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.380
<v Speaker 3>did like seven episodes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on NBC.</v>

1738
01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:41.320
<v Speaker 3>But then it got canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was like during the writers strike.</v>

1739
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1740
01:12:42.971 --> 01:12:43.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1741
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1742
01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.770
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're just becomes,</v>

1743
01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the industry is all about perception </v>

1744
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:52.800
<v Speaker 3>than the perception is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1745
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:52.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's cold.</v>

1746
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1747
01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.210
<v Speaker 3>how weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1748
01:12:55.730 --> 01:12:57.760
<v Speaker 3>I kind of thought there would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1749
01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember talking to Vicky and saying </v>

1750
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when news,</v>

1751
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I kept saying when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1752
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:07.190
<v Speaker 3>when news radio gets canceled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I'll probably be the hardest for </v>

1753
01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:07.190
<v Speaker 3>me to get work of anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1754
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I just think that because I was a first </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the credits and the show was never a </v>

1755
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.480
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1756
01:13:13.481 --> 01:13:15.520
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how they do that.</v>

1757
01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everyone else was a supporting player</v>

1758
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:23.060
<v Speaker 3>on a critically acclaimed show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1759
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:25.830
<v Speaker 3>but I was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1760
01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:30.910
<v Speaker 3>supposedly the lead character on a show </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't a hit.</v>

1761
01:13:30.911 --> 01:13:32.830
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he couldn't carry a show.</v>

1762
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a weird,</v>

1763
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.530
<v Speaker 2>weird to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't know.</v>

1764
01:13:36.531 --> 01:13:38.960
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that don't even realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>news radio wasn't a hit,</v>

1765
01:13:38.961 --> 01:13:41.780
<v Speaker 2>but while we were on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were on the air.</v>

1766
01:13:41.781 --> 01:13:46.781
<v Speaker 2>We moved nine times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine times over the course of five </v>

1767
01:13:46.781 --> 01:13:46.781
<v Speaker 2>seasons and</v>

1768
01:13:46.781 --> 01:13:48.460
<v Speaker 3>the guy had the head of programming at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1769
01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.430
<v Speaker 3>at a scheduling at NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hated us.</v>

1770
01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1771
01:13:52.981 --> 01:13:54.280
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was that whole thing with,</v>

1772
01:13:54.281 --> 01:13:56.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rolling stone article.</v>

1773
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1774
01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:00.280
<v Speaker 2>But that was when we were already </v>
<v Speaker 2>floundering.</v>

1775
01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was also.</v>

1776
01:14:01.481 --> 01:14:02.650
<v Speaker 2>But the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

1777
01:14:02.651 --> 01:14:07.651
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should tell people what that </v>

1778
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:07.651
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the rolling?</v>

1779
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:09.970
<v Speaker 2>The rolling start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Stanley or Paul Stanley Kiss Paul </v>

1780
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Simms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the creator,</v>

1781
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.050
<v Speaker 2>the show called NBC Thursday night </v>
<v Speaker 2>lineup,</v>

1782
01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:17.800
<v Speaker 2>which was their big friends lineup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called it a shit sandwich.</v>

1783
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>He called it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really,</v>

1784
01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:23.971
<v Speaker 2>it should have been shit was the button </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're real sandwich was </v>

1785
01:14:23.971 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>friends and then you would have friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and then you would have this terrible</v>

1786
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:27.170
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1787
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.530
<v Speaker 2>it was always on after France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1788
01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:34.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously NBC was very upset that Paul </v>

1789
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:34.990
<v Speaker 2>was calling sex in the city or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>single guy to pieces of shit,</v>

1790
01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1791
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:41.401
<v Speaker 2>they were terrible shows and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends was brilliant show that </v>

1792
01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:44.071
<v Speaker 2>everybody tuned into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they sort of watch those other shows </v>

1793
01:14:44.071 --> 01:14:44.071
<v Speaker 2>just because they were on.</v>

1794
01:14:44.071 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 3>But I guess it got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Guy gets named Preston Beckmann </v>

1795
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 3>hated our show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when we did the pilot,</v>

1796
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:51.971
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to pick it up really </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were originally supposed to </v>

1797
01:14:51.971 --> 01:14:54.461
<v Speaker 3>get it Thursday slot ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this guy who was in charge of the </v>

1798
01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:55.670
<v Speaker 3>MVC schedule wouldn't let us have it </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thursday slot.</v>

1799
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:58.550
<v Speaker 3>So then he basically kept trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>a slot that would kill us,</v>

1800
01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 3>so that's why they put us on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are the lead leading,</v>

1801
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:07.130
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on with wings and fraser a frazier</v>

1802
01:15:07.131 --> 01:15:11.840
<v Speaker 3>and those shows were both doing poorly </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we came along and he put us on with</v>

1803
01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:15.740
<v Speaker 3>those shows and we our show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we boosted the ratings of both shows.</v>

1804
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Well all of a sudden it became like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent lineup for,</v>

1805
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 2>for comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a different time than men.</v>

1806
01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:24.990
<v Speaker 2>There was no dvrs shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't exist in a,</v>

1807
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 2>in a non popular spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to be a spot where people are </v>

1808
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 2>already looking.</v>

1809
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ratings we were getting in those,</v>

1810
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:34.730
<v Speaker 3>we're getting like 10 million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>tuning in and those ratings in those </v>

1811
01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.240
<v Speaker 3>days were considered a ratings failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like today,</v>

1812
01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:38.580
<v Speaker 3>if you got those ratings here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one show on TV.</v>

1813
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

1814
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.270
<v Speaker 2>There's so many channels now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point in time,</v>

1815
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:47.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lou Martin used to show up at our </v>

1816
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:50.120
<v Speaker 2>writer's meetings at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather at the run the table read was t </v>

1817
01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.590
<v Speaker 2>with a shirt on with a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever we were in,</v>

1818
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.590
<v Speaker 2>what place we are in and he showed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was 84.</v>

1819
01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're an 84th place.</v>

1820
01:15:58.530 --> 01:15:59.850
<v Speaker 2>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>

1821
01:15:59.851 --> 01:16:00.720
<v Speaker 2>84,</v>
<v Speaker 2>88.</v>

1822
01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.280
<v Speaker 2>That's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they finally,</v>

1823
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:07.310
<v Speaker 2>when they put us up against drew Carey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we had Warren littlefield </v>

1824
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:09.760
<v Speaker 2>actually came down to a table read to </v>
<v Speaker 2>let us know that they still loved us.</v>

1825
01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:11.400
<v Speaker 2>They surfaced Turkey dinner.</v>

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 2>the denominations go and I think the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Frasier,</v>

1847
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:20.951
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Hyde Pierce and Dave turns to me </v>

1848
01:17:20.951 --> 01:17:20.951
<v Speaker 2>and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does Phil have to do to win?</v>

1849
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1850
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.870
<v Speaker 3>it was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was David.</v>

1851
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:32.690
<v Speaker 3>David Hyde Pierce looks so embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be winning.</v>

1852
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>He was literally up there like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is all the blood drained out of his </v>

1853
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just going,</v>

1854
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm Phil Hartman.</v>

1855
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:42.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>

1856
01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't even put a sentence </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1857
01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1858
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the choice behind that </v>

1859
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:50.200
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was weird.</v>

1860
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:50.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1861
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.161
<v Speaker 2>don't kill someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then expect them to win sort of </v>

1862
01:17:54.161 --> 01:17:54.580
<v Speaker 2>messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sending out two murders.</v>

1863
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 2>It's cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being murdered as a cheat.</v>

1864
01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a strange,</v>

1865
01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:06.281
<v Speaker 2>strange times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what did you guys do at the Sag </v>

1866
01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:06.281
<v Speaker 2>Awards?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That got us kicked out forever?</v>

1867
01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:06.281
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1868
01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>

1869
01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time,</v>

1870
01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I guess because we all thought what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid award show,</v>

1871
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:19.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the first year of the SAG </v>

1872
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.550
<v Speaker 3>awards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me say this is ridiculous.</v>

1873
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Why actors voting about each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving awards,</v>

1874
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 3>those saying who's best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

1875
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our union is deciding who is best and it</v>

1876
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:29.760
<v Speaker 3>creates this weird,</v>

1877
01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:34.350
<v Speaker 2>this culture of ass kissing and fakery </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1878
01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.390
<v Speaker 2>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a wonderful project.</v>

1879
01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what we do,</v>

1880
01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:40.700
<v Speaker 3>I think Maura and I found where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1881
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1882
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:46.390
<v Speaker 3>the service bar was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have had like the big industrial </v>

1883
01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.220
<v Speaker 3>corkscrew and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've said we're going back there,</v>

1884
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:54.221
<v Speaker 3>just opening up bottles of wine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing them up to the table and I </v>

1885
01:18:54.221 --> 01:18:54.221
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.740
<v Speaker 3>and then we had andy with this to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>which was.</v>

1887
01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:02.420
<v Speaker 3>So who did want to be doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>notable that got us kicked out?</v>

1888
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really remember.</v>

1889
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:07.310
<v Speaker 3>I think we were just noisy and rude and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing.</v>

1890
01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:09.050
<v Speaker 3>We were applauding inappropriately.</v>

1891
01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1892
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1893
01:19:11.071 --> 01:19:13.000
<v Speaker 2>there was no malaria medicine back then </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there,</v>

1894
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.870
<v Speaker 2>drink the malaria medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he took a reporters over,</v>

1895
01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.220
<v Speaker 2>the reporter came up to him with a tape </v>
<v Speaker 2>recorder and ask them some questions.</v>

1896
01:19:20.221 --> 01:19:25.221
<v Speaker 2>Dave took his microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck it in his drink and then pushed </v>

1897
01:19:25.221 --> 01:19:27.440
<v Speaker 2>him and that's when we realized like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave was off the tracks together,</v>

1898
01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:29.610
<v Speaker 2>the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't dave anymore.</v>

1899
01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And then Dave was fucking screaming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this Tony Guy,</v>

1900
01:19:32.341 --> 01:19:35.580
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking up my show and my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1901
01:19:35.581 --> 01:19:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1902
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.470
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Dave's going to hit him.</v>

1903
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:40.660
<v Speaker 2>And I had to get in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

1904
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I had a corner him at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like physically,</v>

1905
01:19:43.171 --> 01:19:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I had a physically cornered dave to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>him from attacking this other guy.</v>

1906
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1907
01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.890
<v Speaker 3>but we were always the ones to last to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave the bar.</v>

1908
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.560
<v Speaker 3>The news radio crew was always last to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave the bar.</v>

1909
01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we had this idea.</v>

1910
01:19:57.030 --> 01:20:01.530
<v Speaker 3>We felt like we were like the punks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>prime time comedy.</v>

1911
01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:04.740
<v Speaker 2>We were the least bullshitty of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1912
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.970
<v Speaker 2>there's this whole culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this actor,</v>

1913
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's one of the reasons why I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do newsradio afterwards,</v>

1914
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:13.860
<v Speaker 2>like the thought of working with actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>actors for five years.</v>

1915
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:19.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like somehow or another I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to see the worst case scenario </v>

1916
01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:22.851
<v Speaker 2>with this hardball and then slip into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best case scenario for five years </v>

1917
01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:27.261
<v Speaker 2>and news radio and then it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditions and being around real actors </v>

1918
01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:27.261
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1919
01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:30.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the other Shit I can do?</v>

1920
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.500
<v Speaker 2>And he's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a casper.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1922
01:20:34.021 --> 01:20:39.021
<v Speaker 2>My joke doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should cut my joke that his joke is </v>

1923
01:20:39.021 --> 01:20:39.021
<v Speaker 2>the better joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1924
01:20:39.021 --> 01:20:42.920
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>

1925

<v Speaker 2>environment and you would also hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't put that pencil in my current </v>

1926
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:51.110

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1928
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.930

<v Speaker 2>do you remember the time we had to.</v>

1929
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.100
<v Speaker 2>We actually had to sit down and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they played that presentation for us,</v>

1930
01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:56.930
<v Speaker 2>all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1931
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:58.500
<v Speaker 2>the sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment.</v>

1932
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt so badly for that person.</v>

01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:07.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know the group of people </v>

1934
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:08.370
<v Speaker 2>you've just walked in front of it was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

1935
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:13.460
<v Speaker 2>They have to go over this whole thing of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's appropriate and what's not </v>

1936
01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:13.460
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

1937
01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.930

<v Speaker 2>cut down about 98 percent of all </v>

1938
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>conversation on our set.</v>

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden I'm in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dressing room with Andy and Andy is</v>

1962
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:18.540
<v Speaker 2>sitting cross legged and he has clogs </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1963
01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got these weird brown corduroy </v>

1964
01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:24.090
<v Speaker 2>pants and he's flipping his foot back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>

1965
01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:25.830
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think you're going to be famous?</v>

1966
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

1967
01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going to be.</v>

1968
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be.</v>

1969
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I've already decided I'm going to be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

1970
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to be really,</v>

1971
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:41.871
<v Speaker 2>really famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this is gonna be the show </v>

1972
01:22:41.871 --> 01:22:41.871
<v Speaker 2>for you or maybe not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1973
01:22:41.871 --> 01:22:42.750
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1974
01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1975
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.060
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1976
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it's already happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:22:47.131 --> 01:22:52.131
<v Speaker 2>I think the arc of your friendship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy was the most interesting of the </v>

1978
01:22:52.131 --> 01:22:55.281
<v Speaker 2>whole cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd only wish I hadn't marijuana back </v>

1979
01:22:55.281 --> 01:22:55.281
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:22:55.281 --> 01:22:59.210
<v Speaker 2>I would've found him so much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating because I had testosterone </v>

1981
01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:00.960
<v Speaker 2>and adrenaline and that was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday was just don't kill Andi.</v>

1982
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking kill him because he was </v>

1983
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 2>just so out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never</v>

1984
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.050
<v Speaker 1>met someone so out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on set.</v>

1985
01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Nobody enjoyed andy more than you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved him,</v>

1986
01:23:10.911 --> 01:23:15.911
<v Speaker 1>like doing scenes like joe had so a show</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting through scenes with him because </v>

1987
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>they would laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would bust you up constantly.</v>

1988
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:23.550
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the funniest human beings </v>

1989
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I've ever met in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:27.450
<v Speaker 1>There's only been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a few human beings that </v>

1991
01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I've ever met in my life where I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1992
01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking original.</v>

1993
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is one of them and Andy Dick </v>

1994
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 1>is one of them don't always funnier than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy,</v>

1995
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but he's a standup but Andy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

1996
01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:38.980
<v Speaker 1>he was funny and there's no doubt he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented is so weird,</v>

1997
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:44.010
<v Speaker 1>but it needs to be handled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy's one of those guys that needs a </v>

1998
01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:47.791
<v Speaker 1>Paul Simms and crew behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right for them and you put them in the </v>

1999
01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:49.060
<v Speaker 1>end and he's Goddamn gold and after that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was over,</v>

2000
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:54.061

<v Speaker 1>I was no one grabbing him and doing </v>

2001
01:23:54.061 --> 01:23:54.061
<v Speaker 1>another one of these.</v>

2002

<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2003
01:23:55.361 --> 01:24:00.361
<v Speaker 1>which was so bizarre for few years on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it less than perfect or wasn't used </v>

2004
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 1>on that front?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't met even been as long as news </v>

<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

2019
01:24:37.501 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like an ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a text recently,</v>

2020
01:24:38.351 --> 01:24:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

2021
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And then I woke up and I just got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>text from a friend said that Andy was in</v>

2022
01:24:44.801 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 1>the bar downstairs from where my </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment is,</v>

2023
01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:52.420
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Dick is here and he's making a </v>

2024
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.150
<v Speaker 1>complete ass of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had,</v>

2025
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.270
<v Speaker 1>he was like running through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

2026
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:58.990
<v Speaker 1>He was like grabbing the waitresses tits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was like a go,</v>

2027
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.430
<v Speaker 1>like stealing food off people's plates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a one point he apparently he crawled</v>

2028
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:08.431
<v Speaker 1>under all the tables and was knocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tables over and then he went into the </v>

2029
01:25:08.431 --> 01:25:09.540
<v Speaker 1>kitchen and tried to make out with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2030
01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:11.880
<v Speaker 1>the dishwasher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2031
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:15.270
<v Speaker 1>how is he in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2032
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.750
<v Speaker 1>how has it been?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rested?</v>

2033
01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:21.751
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do a joke about it in my act </v>

2034
01:25:21.751 --> 01:25:21.751
<v Speaker 1>because it's so ridiculous.</v>

2035
01:25:21.751 --> 01:25:22.060
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep believe Andy did get arrested.</v>

2036
01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he doesn't get a </v>

2037
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:28.471
<v Speaker 1>resident every day a day that goes by </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's not arrested in like you </v>

2038
01:25:28.471 --> 01:25:31.831
<v Speaker 1>could have a TV show called let's get </v>
<v Speaker 1>any dick arrested and this is what it </v>

2039
01:25:31.831 --> 01:25:34.471
<v Speaker 1>would be just everyday you show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he is committing a felony </v>

2040
01:25:34.471 --> 01:25:35.470
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably poor fucking guy.</v>

2041
01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs to be handled.</v>

2042
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:39.460
<v Speaker 1>But even if he's handled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go out of control now.</v>

2043
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:44.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean that that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think news radio is such a good place </v>

2044
01:25:44.461 --> 01:25:45.640
<v Speaker 1>for him because none of us really would </v>
<v Speaker 1>take any shit from him that yes.</v>

2045
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.000
<v Speaker 1>And also because he never became famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that show.</v>

2046
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always floundering and it never </v>

2047
01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:54.090
<v Speaker 1>really became a hit after it was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndication.</v>

2048
01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:56.410
<v Speaker 1>That's when it began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were some moments,</v>

2049
01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:58.570
<v Speaker 1>there were some moments where Andy tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get crazy,</v>

2050
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially,</v>

2051
01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would try not to pay attention or try</v>

2052
01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2053
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:08.681
<v Speaker 1>force extra attention on himself or </v>
<v Speaker 1>still delaying things are fucking up </v>

2054
01:26:08.681 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>rehearsals or card game to show up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2055
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:17.360
<v Speaker 1>His son on the set when he left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove home and forgot his fucking kid.</v>

2056
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:18.860
<v Speaker 1>It sent this comedy now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2057
01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2058
01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw him the other day at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>open mic or give the poor kid a hug.</v>

2059
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some,</v>

2060
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:31.160
<v Speaker 1>actually did improv with Andy at Improv </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic io io.</v>

<v Speaker 1>had the ankle bracelet on.</v>

2062
01:26:33.771 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 1>So he was sober and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2063

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2065
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy,</v>

2066
01:26:39.201 --> 01:26:44.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird to be around you when you're </v>

2067
01:26:44.201 --> 01:26:44.201
<v Speaker 1>now when he's not fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:26:44.201 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Last time I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sober.</v>

2069
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.750
<v Speaker 1>He came up to the company or to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv rather?</v>

2070
01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took a picture of him.</v>

2071
01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always said with any of those,</v>

2072
01:26:50.931 --> 01:26:55.931
<v Speaker 1>and I never really understood why he </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs so much drugs and booze because I </v>

2073
01:26:55.931 --> 01:26:57.040
<v Speaker 1>don't know what inhibitions he's trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to release was.</v>

2074
01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:02.040
<v Speaker 1>That's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to quell the demons of his </v>

2075
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:02.040
<v Speaker 1>past memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2076
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and I had a long conversation about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2077
01:27:03.111 --> 01:27:05.540
<v Speaker 1>once we told me he doesn't remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything from age,</v>

2078
01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:08.510
<v Speaker 1>like eight or nine on anything earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

2079
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:09.910
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

2080
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.810
<v Speaker 1>he literally doesn't remember his </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

2081
01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:17.150
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no recollection because it was horribly </v>

2082
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:17.150
<v Speaker 1>traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know his parents.</v>

2083
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2084
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I think he met them after he became </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>

2085
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been in the last few years.</v>

2086
01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck happened to him,</v>

2087
01:27:22.401 --> 01:27:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight story from him,</v>

2088
01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but you don't make an Andy Dick with </v>
<v Speaker 1>love and attention and you know,</v>

2089
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you only make one of those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible amounts of neglect.</v>

2090
01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it was an evil Japan,</v>

2091
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Andy Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny how it works that way </v>

2092
01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:40.830
<v Speaker 1>when you have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up life to,</v>

2093
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:43.610
<v Speaker 1>to make a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly brilliantly funny person.</v>

2094
01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:46.580
<v Speaker 1>And like everyone that I know Joe was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>

2095
01:27:46.581 --> 01:27:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I usually say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2096
01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.960
<v Speaker 1>the childhood background for Comedians </v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically the same as porn stars </v>

2097
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.830
<v Speaker 1>because it is convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't usually have the abs for porn.</v>

2098
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.500
<v Speaker 1>You of course go against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule.</v>

2099
01:27:58.501 --> 01:28:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I fuck up the whole room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could do porn you've wanted to to</v>

2100
01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.620
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Back when there was money and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it.</v>

2102
01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2103
01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Announcer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline my way out of Hollywood.</v>

2104
01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Fucking do a porno and make millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:13.790
<v Speaker 1>So you have thought about directing </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>

2106
01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Really have it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the guy on news radio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2108
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I do not remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a writer that also wrote for </v>

2109
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:21.720
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>

2110
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.190
<v Speaker 1>season one because I was living in north</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood at the time and um,</v>

2111
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:28.760
<v Speaker 1>he took me to a set and it was a telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2112
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Kelly and Jeanine.</v>

2113
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to a,</v>

2114
01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:36.340
<v Speaker 1>a lesbian shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was back in the vivid days when </v>

2115
01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 1>they were making a ton of money because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were selling vhs tapes.</v>

2116
01:28:36.621 --> 01:28:41.621
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even selling dvds back </v>

2117
01:28:41.621 --> 01:28:41.621
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was [inaudible] 94.</v>

2118
01:28:41.621 --> 01:28:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went to the set and it was so </v>

2119
01:28:44.921 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 1>oddly clinical and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the girl Janine,</v>

2120
01:28:47.661 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 1>who wound up marrying Jesse James and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having kids with them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're a pussy.</v>

2128
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:12.750

<v Speaker 1>but if I'm going to get mouth cancer </v>

<v Speaker 1>I got a wart on my lip from the comedy </v>

2153
01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:14.010
<v Speaker 1>store because the microphone and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments dorm.</v>

2154
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I know this what it's from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from talking to people that you know </v>

2155
01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.620
<v Speaker 1>from all these different guys use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a certain spot or the </v>

2156
01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.221
<v Speaker 1>microphone would always touch my lip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd always have the microphone right </v>

2157
01:30:25.221 --> 01:30:28.101
<v Speaker 1>here in my lip and all of a sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting this fucking growth on </v>

2158
01:30:28.101 --> 01:30:28.101
<v Speaker 1>my lip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2159
01:30:28.101 --> 01:30:31.850
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to a dermatologist and they </v>

2160
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:32.730
<v Speaker 1>said it was a warrant and they burned a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking wart off my lip.</v>

2161
01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:38.090
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting from the fucking comedy </v>

2162
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:41.271
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God I never came back in that </v>

2163
01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:41.271
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exact spot right here.</v>

2164
01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:43.530
<v Speaker 1>If you take up wipes now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wipes now accepting white.</v>

2165
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2166
01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I really got into probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really got into probiotics and I eat a</v>

2167
01:30:48.301 --> 01:30:51.720
<v Speaker 1>lot of acidophilus and I drink a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha tea.</v>

2168
01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And when I started reading about it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>acidophilus is one of the most </v>

2169
01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.591
<v Speaker 1>aggressive bacteria is healthy bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>is and that it really is an excellent </v>

2170
01:31:00.591 --> 01:31:00.870
<v Speaker 1>aid in.</v>

2171
01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It kills other bacteria that it comes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with.</v>

2172
01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So it literally coach your skin so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of your skin.</v>

2173
01:31:07.711 --> 01:31:12.180
<v Speaker 1>So if any cold bacteria or any virus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria tries to fuck with you,</v>

2174
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:17.210
<v Speaker 1>it attacks it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really like having your own </v>

2175
01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:18.870
<v Speaker 1>healthy soldiers that live in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was not doing that,</v>

2176
01:31:18.871 --> 01:31:23.550
<v Speaker 1>because sounds like soldiers in a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2177
01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:29.340
<v Speaker 1>but when I wasn't doing it when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling a lot for the UFC and for </v>

2178
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:29.400
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm traveling all the time.</v>

2179
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:34.401
<v Speaker 1>I was getting sick all the time and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as I really got on the Kombucha </v>

2180
01:31:34.401 --> 01:31:34.401
<v Speaker 1>tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it killed it.</v>

2181
01:31:34.401 --> 01:31:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped getting sick.</v>

2182
01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should try and learn to the stomach </v>

2183
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha.</v>

2184
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:41.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't like it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just tastes like vinegar.</v>

2185
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>

2186
01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.530

<v Speaker 1>Andy was into Kombucha.</v>

2187
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:51.910

2191
01:31:58.750 --> 01:32:02.541
<v Speaker 1>do massive amounts of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would also take like every urban </v>

<v Speaker 1>known to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have like the sorting is </v>

2199
01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to combat the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drugs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone from news radio,</v>

2216
01:33:04.291 --> 01:33:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I always considered to me everyone from </v>
<v Speaker 1>these radios,</v>

2217
01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2219
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:11.480
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2220
01:33:11.481 --> 01:33:16.481
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unusual bond that we all </v>

2221
01:33:16.481 --> 01:33:18.721
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen root called me awhile back for </v>

2222
01:33:18.721 --> 01:33:18.721
<v Speaker 1>some party that was thrown and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't make it.</v>

2223
01:33:18.721 --> 01:33:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I was going out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

2224
01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:24.811
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good is it to talk to this guy </v>

2225
01:33:24.811 --> 01:33:26.461
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like sometimes we won't see </v>

2226
01:33:26.461 --> 01:33:26.461
<v Speaker 1>each other for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2227
01:33:26.461 --> 01:33:26.461
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it never feels like.</v>

2228
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:28.240
<v Speaker 1>But whenever I see anyone from news </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

2229
01:33:28.241 --> 01:33:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like any time has </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed,</v>

2230
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Even the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even andy,</v>

2234
01:33:38.651 --> 01:33:40.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude names ready?</v>

2236
01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.900
<v Speaker 1>But podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2237
01:33:43.901 --> 01:33:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Well there was one time when we were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about doing something.</v>

2238
01:33:46.841 --> 01:33:51.841
<v Speaker 1>We were on the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was when Brian Cowen played my </v>

2239
01:33:51.841 --> 01:33:51.850
<v Speaker 1>brother and we were talking about doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you're doing it.</v>

2240
01:33:51.851 --> 01:33:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And we actually had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been over there.</v>

2241
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2242
01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:55.720
<v Speaker 1>the Pirelli brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:33:55.721 --> 01:34:00.190
<v Speaker 1>But we never want them doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always how it's like Joey.</v>

2244
01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:02.260
<v Speaker 1>But like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2245
01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 1>using the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember with Brad Isaac segment using</v>

2246
01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:08.890
<v Speaker 1>the news radio cast as like the mercury </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater players,</v>

2247
01:34:08.891 --> 01:34:13.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a repertory acting ensemble that </v>

2248
01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:13.891
<v Speaker 1>you would just like do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2249
01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:15.380
<v Speaker 1>just do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like independent movies would.</v>

2250
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.470
<v Speaker 1>But it would only be the cast of news </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and all these different movies.</v>

2251
01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 1>That would have been a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We totally should have done a news radio</v>

2252
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>movie though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was never like.</v>

2253
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Because I said well it really wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

2254
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Canceled every season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every season.</v>

2255
01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we kept doing season </v>
<v Speaker 1>finale.</v>

2256
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 1>We kept doing series finales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of every season there </v>

2257
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were so crazy like the space one,</v>

2258
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.820
<v Speaker 1>we do these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the titanic one,</v>

2259
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:41.830
<v Speaker 1>we did a titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won the whole episode of the show took </v>

2260
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:42.750
<v Speaker 1>place in a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were like underwater.</v>

2261
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

2262
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:48.750
<v Speaker 1>if I had a dive underwater and I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I said that I brought my </v>

2263
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:53.011
<v Speaker 1>three d stereo cameras to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had this great three d photo of you </v>

2264
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.270
<v Speaker 1>in the break room set that was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming pool,</v>

2265
01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.020
<v Speaker 1>a lake with up to here and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

2266
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:03.040
<v Speaker 3>water spraying past you trying to fix </v>
<v Speaker 3>this really cool photo.</v>

2267
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no kidding.</v>

2268
01:35:06.041 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Can you email it to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it work?</v>

2269
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2270
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I could probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2271
01:35:09.281 --> 01:35:10.550
<v Speaker 3>could probably scan it and then you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2272
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 3>I get scattered is like two side by side</v>
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>

2273
01:35:13.810 --> 01:35:16.960
<v Speaker 4>You went from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You started doing the poker show,</v>

2274
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you did a,</v>

2275
01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:22.960
<v Speaker 4>you try to do a bunch of pilots and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decided recently to start doing </v>

2276
01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:22.960
<v Speaker 4>standup.</v>

2277
01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually right after I got the </v>

2278
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:28.440
<v Speaker 3>court ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2279
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:28.440
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2280
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any,</v>

2281
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:29.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2282
01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making much money these days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still making a decent living but not</v>

2283
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:40.630
<v Speaker 3>when you have to pay $17,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a month and about a quarter of what I </v>

2284
01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:44.801
<v Speaker 3>need to earn to be broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I figured well,</v>

2285
01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe stand up at least I can go out and</v>

2286
01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:51.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I can put an act together and you</v>

2287
01:35:51.441 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if somebody told me,</v>

2288
01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you got some TV,</v>

2289
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:58.990
<v Speaker 3>if you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got some name recognition for </v>

2290
01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:01.221
<v Speaker 3>being on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go out and do standup and make </v>

2291
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:01.221
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2292
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:01.221
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2293
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:05.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could say you don't even </v>

2294
01:36:05.831 --> 01:36:05.831
<v Speaker 3>have to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

2295
01:36:05.831 --> 01:36:05.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come after a little while.</v>

2296
01:36:05.831 --> 01:36:07.840
<v Speaker 3>People will stop showing up to.</v>

2297
01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:08.540
<v Speaker 3>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2298
01:36:08.541 --> 01:36:11.120
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'll see what I'll see if I can get</v>

2299
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:14.000
<v Speaker 3>the word gets out quicker today than it </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever has before.</v>

2300
01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Like screech really couldn't have pulled</v>
<v Speaker 3>it off if he started out today.</v>

2301
01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2302

<v Speaker 4>newspaper or do you have some ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've already developed or</v>

2338
01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:38.410
<v Speaker 3>considered?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rather?</v>

2339

<v Speaker 3>just I,</v>

2340
01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:45.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2342
01:37:47.251 --> 01:37:47.650
<v Speaker 3>just keeping ideas in my head for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that I thought might be funny.</v>

2343
01:37:48.090 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it would be something that </v>

2344
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.090
<v Speaker 3>came up in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2345
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>

2347
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.020
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2348
01:37:57.070 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I kind of decided that it wasn't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what I did when I was a kid.</v>

2349
01:38:01.591 --> 01:38:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I was going to write stuff out word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

2350
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I was just kinda like have ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are.</v>

2351
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Areas that I thought were funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it through in my head about what,</v>

2352
01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>what I would want to cover A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some jokes in my head,</v>

2353
01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd make notes,</v>

2354
01:38:15.711 --> 01:38:20.711
<v Speaker 1>sort of point form notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't let myself write out the </v>

2355
01:38:20.711 --> 01:38:21.420
<v Speaker 1>jokes in whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just point for form and,</v>

2356
01:38:21.421 --> 01:38:26.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and keep it from feeling like I </v>

2357
01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:28.431
<v Speaker 1>was like reading a monologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acting like,</v>

2358
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:30.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want it to feel like acting.</v>

2359
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the trick of comedy.</v>

2360
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very rarely write out jokes in like,</v>

2361
01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other day I'm at the zoo.</v>

2362
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I very rarely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

2363
01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then I do it as a goof,</v>

2364
01:38:42.601 --> 01:38:44.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a practice,</v>

2365
01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:46.050
<v Speaker 1>like I'll sit and instead of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2366
01:38:46.051 --> 01:38:48.120
<v Speaker 1>just writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just random,</v>

2367
01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2368
01:38:49.411 --> 01:38:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to write a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've done it.</v>

2369
01:38:51.421 --> 01:38:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I've done it a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time I just write,</v>

2370
01:38:54.211 --> 01:38:59.211
<v Speaker 1>I just sit down and I write for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it might be depressing and </v>

2371
01:38:59.211 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic and then there'll be one </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking one paragraph chunk.</v>

2372
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2408
01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:29.871
<v Speaker 1>is that he gets this weird opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do stand up where he did stand up a </v>

2409
01:40:29.871 --> 01:40:34.101
<v Speaker 1>bunch of years ago and did the Bob Hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke that we've all talked about on the </v>

2410
01:40:34.101 --> 01:40:35.160
<v Speaker 1>podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't heard the joke,</v>

2411
01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:37.860
<v Speaker 1>he got up in front of a room full of old</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and said,</v>

2412
01:40:37.861 --> 01:40:42.861
<v Speaker 1>do you think when Bob hope died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they flew out his body to entertain all </v>

2413
01:40:42.861 --> 01:40:44.260
<v Speaker 1>the dead troops to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and it bombed so bad.</v>

2415
01:40:45.650 --> 01:40:47.400
<v Speaker 1>He stopped doing standup for like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2416
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:48.090
<v Speaker 1>More than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

2417
01:40:48.091 --> 01:40:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The timing.</v>

2418
01:40:49.561 --> 01:40:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it was more because it was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>bob hooked,</v>

2419
01:40:51.451 --> 01:40:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember,</v>

2420
01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:57.170
<v Speaker 1>but then I didn't get back until like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

2421
01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So you did a little bit at one point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2422
01:40:59.681 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 1>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I threw you up in Atlanta.</v>

2423
01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You went up thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2424
01:41:02.361 --> 01:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2425
01:41:02.891 --> 01:41:07.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a new girlfriend and you quit </v>

2426
01:41:07.891 --> 01:41:07.891
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:41:07.891 --> 01:41:07.891
<v Speaker 1>That was like for like a month or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

2428
01:41:07.891 --> 01:41:09.490
<v Speaker 1>It's relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would get you.</v>

2429
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Your relationships would get you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just wouldn't have the time.</v>

2430
01:41:12.190 --> 01:41:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well right now I can't even imagine </v>

2431
01:41:17.190 --> 01:41:19.081
<v Speaker 1>being in that same relationship because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much do stand up once or twice </v>

2432
01:41:19.081 --> 01:41:20.730
<v Speaker 1>at night now and I have a podcast on top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it like I've been up.</v>

2433
01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.630
<v Speaker 1>This is my second podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have another one right after.</v>

2434
01:41:22.631 --> 01:41:27.631
<v Speaker 1>This just seems so much happier to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I not just being out of the </v>

2435
01:41:27.971 --> 01:41:32.971
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you know you're getting a chance </v>

2436
01:41:32.971 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 1>to express yourself now in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get a chance to do before you</v>

2437
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:39.360
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then all you could do is make your </v>

2438
01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.180
<v Speaker 1>funny videos that's making those videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed me.</v>

2439
01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's sitting in front of by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself editing for till five in the </v>

2440
01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:47.470
<v Speaker 1>morning every night and then he did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all week.</v>

2441
01:41:47.471 --> 01:41:52.471
<v Speaker 1>That that's as creative as that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a slow process and it makes </v>

2442
01:41:52.471 --> 01:41:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not talking to anybody.</v>

2443
01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the problem is that </v>

2444
01:41:59.740 --> 01:41:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you're a real perfectionist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2445
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 1>we just took some of these things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>edit them together,</v>

2446
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:03.820
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the way Dana White's God </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it for video blogs.</v>

2447
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Like we should put a video together if </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's like,</v>

2448
01:42:06.090 --> 01:42:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw on twitter,</v>

2449
01:42:07.301 --> 01:42:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I put up a on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a twitter level.</v>

2450
01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going on stage last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2451
01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I think we just need to keep on doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

2452
01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.530
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find finding.</v>

2453
01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll retweet it and we need to do more </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

2454
01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:20.740
<v Speaker 1>But when I originally hired Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what his job was.</v>

2455
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:22.100
<v Speaker 1>A video guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Know your podcast cohost slash standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

2457
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:26.770
<v Speaker 1>We were getting more listeners with </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and the videos,</v>

2458
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:31.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have an immense talent </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to editing video that,</v>

2459
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2460
01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:37.170
<v Speaker 1>just not being served.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian is actually just started doing </v>

2461
01:42:37.170 --> 01:42:40.861
<v Speaker 1>stand up himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it a long time ago and took a </v>

2462
01:42:40.861 --> 01:42:41.710
<v Speaker 1>bunch of years off and then got back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it again.</v>

2463
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:42.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2464
01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that's why I thought this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2465
01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:47.530
<v Speaker 1>the subject is very fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The starting of the routine.</v>

2466
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel comfortable on stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2467
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's said it's weird because,</v>

2468
01:42:51.611 --> 01:42:53.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took 30 years off,</v>

2469
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how um,</v>

2470
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:03.120
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is feeling comfort because I know in </v>

2471
01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.180
<v Speaker 1>the past when I've done hosting gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt a little funny,</v>

2472
01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm like I'm impersonating someone </v>

2473
01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.451
<v Speaker 1>doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think coming at it with a </v>

2474
01:43:12.451 --> 01:43:15.091
<v Speaker 1>looser form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like going on stage and just trusting </v>

2475
01:43:15.091 --> 01:43:16.390
<v Speaker 1>myself to have areas that I want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into and trusting myself to be funny,</v>

2476
01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2477
01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.310
<v Speaker 1>it has been fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been fun to go up and like find out</v>

2478
01:43:21.311 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 1>what the bits are on stage and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

2479
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the thing about standup is </v>

2480
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:31.561
<v Speaker 1>like there's a totally different thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's in front of a live audience </v>

2481
01:43:31.561 --> 01:43:35.941
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to get laughs and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice is amplified and they're all </v>

2482
01:43:35.941 --> 01:43:38.800
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel their energy looking at you and</v>

2483
01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different synapses fire.</v>

2484
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you were in a social setting and</v>

2485
01:43:43.511 --> 01:43:47.230
<v Speaker 1>someone talked for 45 minutes straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>without letting anyone else talk,</v>

2486
01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you would just think even no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining they were,</v>

2487
01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.320
<v Speaker 1>he'd be on what an asshole</v>

2488
01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.980
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this on stage.</v>

2489
01:43:53.981 --> 01:43:58.981
<v Speaker 2>It's the most ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say that standup is the most </v>

2490
01:43:58.981 --> 01:44:00.971
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous job you could ever want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have and I want to be the only one who </v>

2491
01:44:00.971 --> 01:44:04.300
<v Speaker 2>talks for an hour and I want to have my </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice amplified way above everyone </v>

2492
01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:04.920
<v Speaker 2>else's and I want to be lit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2493
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:06.920
<v Speaker 2>that'd be welded as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else is in the dark.</v>

2494
01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:08.690
<v Speaker 2>It's also weird just because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>

2495
01:44:08.691 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I was always the person trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone laugh though.</v>

2496
01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2497
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:18.010
<v Speaker 2>what I love doing is trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>people laugh like at my high school and </v>

2498
01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:18.860
<v Speaker 2>middle school and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of see like class clown,</v>

2499
01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:20.780
<v Speaker 2>comedian type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that also.</v>

2500
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:25.781
<v Speaker 2>It's not where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like trying to take over </v>

2501
01:44:25.781 --> 01:44:26.090
<v Speaker 2>everybody and be on a microphone stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just trying to make people happy.</v>

2502
01:44:26.590 --> 01:44:31.590
<v Speaker 2>It was most certainly a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different types of people that become </v>

2503
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.590
<v Speaker 2>standup Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2504
01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2505
01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:38.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to say that it always comes from </v>

2506
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.121
<v Speaker 2>one place that's not really true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had just never comes from a good </v>

2507
01:44:40.121 --> 01:44:44.321
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know exactly a huge vista of bad places.</v>

2508
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I had always felt for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was something about me that </v>

2509
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:53.081
<v Speaker 2>wasn't legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wasn't a legitimate comment </v>

2510
01:44:53.081 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't the same guy as </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>

2511
01:44:53.421 --> 01:44:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't afraid of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2512
01:44:55.461 --> 01:44:59.210
<v Speaker 2>I grew up doing martial arts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and I went from fighting,</v>

2513
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2514
01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 2>to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was like this weird thing </v>

2515
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:05.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2516
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:07.870
<v Speaker 2>what am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird jock thing that's doing </v>

2517
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.870
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck am I like,</v>

2518
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:08.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is but doesn't just,</v>

2519
01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:10.040
<v Speaker 2>you just life has to suck.</v>

2520
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:15.430
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to make funny out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the suck your life could suck in all </v>

2521
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.430
<v Speaker 2>kinds of weird ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2522
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:16.010
<v Speaker 2>like Nat Geo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pto,</v>

2523
01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Hanson's livestock was his father used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to beat the fuck out of him,</v>

2524

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's is different.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2526
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:28.271
<v Speaker 2>everyone's had their own little weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that you're trying to make up for </v>

2527
01:45:28.271 --> 01:45:29.490
<v Speaker 2>what that exorbitant amount of attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>you request on stage,</v>

2528
01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2529
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:35.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have some fucking weird </v>

2530
01:45:35.890 --> 01:45:35.960
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never really get there.</v>

2531
01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone.</v>

2532
01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I shouldn't say this because of </v>

2533
01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 2>course it's possible for someone to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great comedian with a happy childhood.</v>

2534
01:45:43.401 --> 01:45:44.630
<v Speaker 2>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2535
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:46.640
<v Speaker 2>if you're just really smart and figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>

2536
01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.350
<v Speaker 2>but I've never met that plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>

2537
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

2538
01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.220
<v Speaker 2>my childhood was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2539
01:45:52.221 --> 01:45:57.221
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my biggest problem is bullies and just </v>

2540
01:45:57.221 --> 01:45:57.350
<v Speaker 2>shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even that is a big issue mainly wise</v>

2541
01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why I got into </v>

2542
01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get into martial arts because I</v>

2543
01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.470
<v Speaker 2>wanted to risk my fucking brain cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go out there.</v>

2544
01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified of other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved around a lot when I was a kid </v>

2545
01:46:08.490 --> 01:46:12.671
<v Speaker 2>and we moved at basically every three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years we moved to a new place and I did </v>

2546
01:46:12.671 --> 01:46:13.270
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2547
01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:18.730
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just you don't have a </v>

2548
01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:18.730
<v Speaker 2>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel stable,</v>

2549
01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:19.970
<v Speaker 2>so you feel this need to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself exorbitantly,</v>

2550
01:46:19.971 --> 01:46:24.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get more attention than he </v>

2551
01:46:24.971 --> 01:46:24.971
<v Speaker 2>deserved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2552
01:46:24.971 --> 01:46:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a drunk dad who was also diagnosed</v>

2553
01:46:25.371 --> 01:46:28.390
<v Speaker 2>as borderline personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>

2554
01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I found that when my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told my mom,</v>

2555
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:36.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's been diagnosed with borderline </v>

2556

01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:07.600
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not setting a positive energy in</v>

2644
01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

2645
01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:13.320
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not really thinking about what </v>

2646
01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:13.320
<v Speaker 2>they want and apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous and so culty.</v>

2647
01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.320
<v Speaker 2>But the fascinating thing is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>confirmation bias.</v>

2648
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You're only looking at what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what supports your case,</v>

2649
01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.460
<v Speaker 2>and there's a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and they're saying,</v>

2650
01:50:24.461 --> 01:50:29.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I envisioned it and that's how I became </v>

2651
01:50:29.461 --> 01:50:29.461
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the,</v>

2652
01:50:29.461 --> 01:50:33.150
<v Speaker 2>we're the fucking people that envisioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they're poor as shit right now </v>

2653
01:50:33.150 --> 01:50:33.160
<v Speaker 2>and they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

2654
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

2655
01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're only using the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are successful.</v>

2656
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:42.250
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to show me a dude who's fucking </v>

2657
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:42.310
<v Speaker 2>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you apply it to him and then he</v>

2658
01:50:42.311 --> 01:50:45.490
<v Speaker 2>goes out in the world and then you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in 15 years and go,</v>

2659
01:50:45.491 --> 01:50:45.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2660
01:50:45.971 --> 01:50:48.430
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are successful and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta show me at least.</v>

2661
01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get.</v>

2662
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:52.420
<v Speaker 2>If you take 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to have at least more than 50</v>

2663
01:50:52.421 --> 01:50:57.421
<v Speaker 2>of them succeed or to be know </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistically meaningful out of a </v>

2664
01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 2>thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2665
01:50:58.310 --> 01:51:03.310
<v Speaker 2>and that one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to let you know the secret that </v>

2666
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:06.271
<v Speaker 2>it's all simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've just got to think positive like </v>

2667
01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:08.971
<v Speaker 2>any religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any religion where people want to </v>

2668
01:51:08.971 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 2>believe that they can do something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

2669
01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 2>that will give them power over the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of creation.</v>

2670
01:51:14.730 --> 01:51:16.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of creation is going to somehow</v>

2671
01:51:16.931 --> 01:51:21.931
<v Speaker 2>fall into line with their wishes because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they prayed to God or they sent out </v>

2672
01:51:22.391 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 2>positive energy.</v>

2673
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:26.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fascinating though and it's</v>

2674
01:51:26.261 --> 01:51:31.261
<v Speaker 2>very unfortunate that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this craze is so discredited and so the,</v>

2675
01:51:31.410 --> 01:51:36.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place where they're coming from is </v>

2676
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:37.951
<v Speaker 2>so illogical because the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking healthy and positive is very </v>

2677
01:51:37.951 --> 01:51:42.661
<v Speaker 2>important for formulating a good life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for figuring out how to be connected to </v>

2678
01:51:42.701 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 2>the right kind of people and how to send</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right kind of energy out so that you</v>

2679
01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you foster healthy relationships and </v>

2680
01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:53.840
<v Speaker 2>that you're what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing in life is something that you </v>

2681
01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 2>get motivation out of or rather that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get satisfaction out of feeling poor,</v>

2682
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:58.810
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a positive outlook is healthy.</v>

2683
01:51:58.850 --> 01:52:00.680
<v Speaker 2>It's better for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2684
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:02.350
<v Speaker 2>you know Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2685
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I think living with my first wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
01:52:05.201 --> 01:52:07.480
<v Speaker 2>so it was just negative about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2687
01:52:07.481 --> 01:52:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Everything was negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2688
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2689
01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:10.120
<v Speaker 2>it is horrible for you.</v>

2690
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there.</v>

2691
01:52:11.351 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I've been there many times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships and in friendships.</v>

2692
01:52:13.901 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I've had friendships where the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are negative and you're like,</v>

2693
01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you get away from them and just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're catching your breath.</v>

2694
01:52:18.641 --> 01:52:20.080
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this person doing to me?</v>

2695
01:52:20.081 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're draining.</v>

2696
01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something to me.</v>

2697
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's definitely positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being positive.</v>

2698
01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:25.710
<v Speaker 2>That part is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet.</v>

2699
01:52:25.711 --> 01:52:28.090
<v Speaker 2>And there's even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is science behind that.</v>

2700
01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>

2701
01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Keeping a positive attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2702
01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:35.240
<v Speaker 2>keeps you healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps your immune system functioning </v>

2703
01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:35.240
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2704
01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen positive and negative thinking</v>

2705
01:52:35.951 --> 01:52:38.120
<v Speaker 2>during a dmt trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

2706
01:52:38.121 --> 01:52:39.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during a psychedelic trip,</v>

2707
01:52:39.641 --> 01:52:44.641
<v Speaker 2>I had this weird moment where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking all these negative things </v>

2708
01:52:44.641 --> 01:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>because psychedelic trips are just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of control.</v>

2709
01:52:46.671 --> 01:52:51.260
<v Speaker 2>There's so beyond bizarre and they're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly,</v>

2710
01:52:51.261 --> 01:52:55.160
<v Speaker 2>like a self examined a Tory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's not even a word,</v>

2711
01:52:55.161 --> 01:52:55.670
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2712
01:52:55.671 --> 01:52:56.090
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2713
01:52:56.091 --> 01:52:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you're so introspective.</v>

2714
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of your life,</v>

2715
01:52:59.901 --> 01:53:02.180
<v Speaker 2>like at a million miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can,</v>

2716
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 2>you can get like a negative thought and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can blow away.</v>

2717
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:09.911
<v Speaker 2>And that's where bad trips come from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the middle of this negative </v>

2718
01:53:09.911 --> 01:53:09.911
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2719
01:53:09.911 --> 01:53:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2720
01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:15.360
<v Speaker 2>this like dmt is a very visionary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience and you have a </v>

2721
01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 2>weird black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

2722
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:21.821
<v Speaker 2>fucking nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark green and dark black patterns and </v>

2723
01:53:21.821 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 2>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the middle of it,</v>

2724
01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:27.881
<v Speaker 2>I realized what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a realize that as being negative and I </v>

2725
01:53:27.881 --> 01:53:29.390
<v Speaker 2>took a deep breath and I let go and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>an became positive,</v>

2726
01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:33.860
<v Speaker 2>decided to think positive and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>blossomed like flowers in front of me.</v>

2727
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:38.870
<v Speaker 2>And the colors changed and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>became bright and beautiful and vibrant </v>

2728
01:53:38.961 --> 01:53:41.540
<v Speaker 2>and it became light in the patterns </v>
<v Speaker 2>became beautiful.</v>

2729
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2730
01:53:42.381 --> 01:53:47.381
<v Speaker 2>this is like a lesson I'm learning from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic experience about the real </v>

2731
01:53:47.381 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 2>physical manifestation of negative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive thoughts.</v>

2732
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:52.330
<v Speaker 2>They actually have a real effect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think they say that,</v>

2733
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:57.370
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you just force yourself to </v>

2734
01:53:57.370 --> 01:53:57.370
<v Speaker 2>smile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2735
01:53:57.370 --> 01:53:58.460
<v Speaker 2>you can reduce depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2736
01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Like your depression will fade a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain all the way if you're really </v>

2737
01:54:03.610 --> 01:54:04.190
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can force yourself to smile.</v>

2738
01:54:04.450 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I really like put on a big demo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just keep it there long enough.</v>

2739
01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:11.090
<v Speaker 2>It'll get brain reacts as though you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

2740
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Your brain starts to release the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals it would if you were actually </v>

2741
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:16.570
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like.</v>

2742
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:17.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2743
01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:19.040
<v Speaker 2>the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind,</v>

2744
01:54:19.041 --> 01:54:21.320
<v Speaker 2>body connection is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is real.</v>

2745
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:26.410
<v Speaker 2>What we are is the most fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 2>organic computer that's ever been </v>

2746
01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:31.391
<v Speaker 2>created and we don't have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>single book on how to use the operating </v>

2747
01:54:31.391 --> 01:54:32.730
<v Speaker 2>system currently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now just the Bible Joe's.</v>

2748
01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible.</v>

2749
01:54:34.530 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 2>We are all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are all raised by people who are </v>

2750
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.620
<v Speaker 2>completely clueless as to how to raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

2751
01:54:39.650 --> 01:54:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every one of us.</v>

2752
01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we develop and you can get in </v>

2753
01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:46.120
<v Speaker 2>these patterns of thinking that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents have,</v>

2754
01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2755
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you grow up around like Mrs Rogan has</v>

2756
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:52.400
<v Speaker 2>a very negative parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially her mom.</v>

2757
01:54:52.401 --> 01:54:57.401
<v Speaker 2>Her mom had a very hard life and her mom</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of those that you can't tell her </v>

2758
01:54:57.401 --> 01:55:01.211
<v Speaker 2>a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is just gonna happen and it's </v>

2759
01:55:01.211 --> 01:55:01.580
<v Speaker 2>just going to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens here?</v>

2760
01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens there and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2761
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:05.310
<v Speaker 2>and Jessica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoops,</v>

2762
01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:07.250
<v Speaker 2>was that her name has managed to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2763
01:55:07.610 --> 01:55:09.260
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2764
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:12.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you develop in a,</v>

2765
01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:17.100
<v Speaker 2>in a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a household at a bunch of negative </v>

2766
01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:17.100
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers like that shit can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2767
01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.200
<v Speaker 2>it becomes like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2768
01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.440
<v Speaker 2>like a path that you get on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a track,</v>

2769
01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:22.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on this track.</v>

2770
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a family where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else might actually metal the brothers,</v>

2771
01:55:26.421 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 2>not that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of my family,</v>

2772
01:55:27.651 --> 01:55:28.910
<v Speaker 2>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2773
01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:29.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you do,</v>

2774
01:55:29.781 --> 01:55:31.790
<v Speaker 2>the system is going to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2775
01:55:31.791 --> 01:55:32.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stacked against you.</v>

2776
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.510
<v Speaker 2>You can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2777
01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:35.050
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2778
01:55:35.090 --> 01:55:40.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of that is my mother was </v>

2779
01:55:40.090 --> 01:55:40.700
<v Speaker 2>working class English and that's the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're raised,</v>

2780
01:55:40.730 --> 01:55:42.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

2781
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>well we'll try what you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really</v>

2782
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.120
<v Speaker 1>can't get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2783
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:50.510
<v Speaker 1>it's all stacked against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God damn difficult to manufacture an </v>

2784
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.740
<v Speaker 1>awesome environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2785
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:54.450
<v Speaker 1>it's been one of my main focuses as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a grownup,</v>

2786
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:59.510
<v Speaker 1>as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to try to manufacture the most </v>

2787
01:55:59.510 --> 01:56:03.171
<v Speaker 1>positive atmosphere possible both in </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and friendships and relationships </v>

2788
01:56:03.171 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>in everything that I do try to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>steer it towards the most positive place</v>

2789
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:09.240
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2790
01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life can be really fucking awesome </v>

2791
01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:15.810
<v Speaker 1>if you do that correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can suck real bad if you don't.</v>

2792
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah know.</v>

2793
01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:22.110
<v Speaker 1>But the secret Nazi shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well as well as the,</v>

2794
01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe her that any,</v>

2795
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.690
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes you feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any control over your destiny is an</v>

2796
01:56:27.691 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 1>illusion because then people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2797
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2798
01:56:30.210 --> 01:56:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I make good choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good things happen.</v>

2799
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's still just pure luck because</v>

2800
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:40.700
<v Speaker 1>every single day you are tied up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain reaction of millions of choices </v>

2801
01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:42.390
<v Speaker 1>that are being made all around you every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2802
01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And all it has to be as one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices be someone wants to shoot you in</v>

2803
01:56:46.531 --> 01:56:50.100
<v Speaker 1>the head and that's the choice that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to shape your destiny.</v>

2804
01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And any day that someone doesn't shoot </v>

2805
01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:55.320
<v Speaker 1>you in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2806
01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:58.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just luck or a guy with a vest once</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blow up a cafe where you're writing </v>

2807
01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:02.361
<v Speaker 1>your novel or somebody sneezes while </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving and goes over the curb or Texas </v>

2808
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:05.370
<v Speaker 1>slams into you and you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2809
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:06.180
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2810
01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been considering this idea over the</v>

2811
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.320
<v Speaker 1>last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that the entire life that we </v>

2812
01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:17.541
<v Speaker 1>live is sort of like a mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 1>program and it's like this giant </v>

2813
01:57:17.541 --> 01:57:19.980
<v Speaker 1>algorithm that's far too complex for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to really wrap our heads around it,</v>

2814
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:25.160
<v Speaker 1>but that all these different motions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these emotions and actions and all </v>

2815
01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:25.760
<v Speaker 1>these different things and circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2816
01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:30.770
<v Speaker 1>they're actually literally really like </v>
<v Speaker 1>integers that it's already a part of </v>

2817
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.770
<v Speaker 1>something that's creating something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2818
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like information theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It was the idea that the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but information is just the </v>

2820
01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:40.761
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire universe is just an </v>

2821
01:57:40.761 --> 01:57:41.130
<v Speaker 1>information storage device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

2822
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the direction that </v>

2823
01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:48.981
<v Speaker 1>humanity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as another thing that's absolutely </v>

2824
01:57:48.981 --> 01:57:50.721
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely fascinated with the idea </v>

2825
01:57:50.721 --> 01:57:51.060
<v Speaker 1>of the singularity and with the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2826
01:57:51.061 --> 01:57:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the,</v>

2827
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.870
<v Speaker 1>the idea of end times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

2828
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.620
<v Speaker 1>The idea of an apocalyptic scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2829
01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 1>you look at like what human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2830
01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I equate human beings to be in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird sort of a caterpillar who doesn't </v>

2831
01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.160
<v Speaker 1>know what's going to turn into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>butterfly.</v>

2832
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:08.640
<v Speaker 1>So we are absolutely obsessed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newest,</v>

2833
01:58:08.641 --> 01:58:13.641
<v Speaker 1>greatest technological innovations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually that that's pushing to a </v>

2834
01:58:13.641 --> 01:58:18.111
<v Speaker 1>certain direction and that direction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a redefinition of life as </v>

2835
01:58:18.111 --> 01:58:18.111
<v Speaker 1>we know it.</v>

2836
01:58:18.111 --> 01:58:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was thought that eventually </v>

2837
01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:24.621
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth itself would develop its own </v>

2838
01:58:24.621 --> 01:58:24.621
<v Speaker 1>consciousness if it doesn't already </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

2839
01:58:24.621 --> 01:58:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You may already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's actually a theory called the</v>

2840
01:58:27.271 --> 01:58:32.271
<v Speaker 1>theory of the Noaa Sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the earth is enveloped in </v>

2841
01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:32.271
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2842
01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:34.470
<v Speaker 1>just like the stratosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a noaa sphere,</v>

2843
01:58:34.471 --> 01:58:38.070
<v Speaker 1>which is a sphere of knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2844
01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And that this notice fear exists around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth and that,</v>

2845
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can tap into it.</v>

2846
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2847
01:58:44.501 --> 01:58:46.870
<v Speaker 1>not even just around the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a dimension around you all the</v>

2848
01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:49.000
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of the muse.</v>

2849
01:58:49.001 --> 01:58:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're really doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2850
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:56.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're being completely creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it you are just an antenna to pull in</v>

2851
01:58:56.291 --> 01:58:58.750
<v Speaker 1>all this information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Tesla had said.</v>

2852
01:58:58.900 --> 01:58:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slow.</v>

2853
01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Who's greatest inventor ever was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was believed that he was receiving </v>

2854
01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:07.630
<v Speaker 1>signals from other other life forms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're giving them this information.</v>

2855
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird thing is that a physicists are</v>

2856
01:59:11.471 --> 01:59:13.730
<v Speaker 1>starting to toy with these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2857
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:16.410
<v Speaker 1>the idea of entanglement and idea of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2858
01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.900
<v Speaker 1>The idea of consciousness being nonlocal</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2859
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Know that your entire body is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of some weird sort of an antenna </v>

2860
01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:23.970
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2861
01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:24.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2862
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:29.310
<v Speaker 1>the hormones and adrenaline and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different things and you run it </v>

2863
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:31.660
<v Speaker 1>all the biological instincts that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to keep the physical body alive or</v>

2864
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no more than like maintenance </v>

2865
01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.311
<v Speaker 1>cycles that you have to run on a BMW.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you read about the Princeton did </v>

2866
01:59:38.311 --> 01:59:41.560
<v Speaker 1>this huge multi year study of a mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine interface?</v>

2867
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2868
01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.140
<v Speaker 1>but basically that attention affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines and uh,</v>

2869
01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:52.700
<v Speaker 1>that they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did these studies where they use a </v>

2870
01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:52.700
<v Speaker 1>random number generator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2871
01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I did hear about this and they just had </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2872
01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:58.590
<v Speaker 1>had a random number generator and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had people just focus not anything </v>

2873
01:59:58.590 --> 01:59:59.410
<v Speaker 1>specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just focus on the machine itself.</v>

2874
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>And the more and more people focused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the machine,</v>

2875
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.950
<v Speaker 1>the less random the machine became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became,</v>

2876
02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>it started having nonrandom patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human consciousness is something we,</v>

2877
02:00:10.130 --> 02:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>we completely don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2878
02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2879
02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's energy that comes out of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that is absolutely tangible.</v>

2880
02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>We just don't have a device to measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2881
02:00:18.490 --> 02:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2882
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>the other thing they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set up these random number </v>

2883
02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.161
<v Speaker 1>generators all around the world and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent them all around the world and </v>

2884
02:00:26.161 --> 02:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>then just coincidentally a nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened because they had a theory that </v>

2885
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>if large numbers of people were thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the same event,</v>

2886
02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that that would have a larger impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these machines and they found the </v>

2887
02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:45.451
<v Speaker 1>correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found that at the time of nine </v>

2888
02:00:45.451 --> 02:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 when the towers fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2889
02:00:47.410 --> 02:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>these machines all around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>started generating nonrandom sequences </v>

2890
02:00:52.410 --> 02:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>of numbers.</v>

2891
02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that they don't really.</v>

2892
02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>All they know is this is like the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they said that,</v>

2893
02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>that just the effect of everyone paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the same event a affected </v>

2894
02:01:04.451 --> 02:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>these machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2895
02:01:05.621 --> 02:01:10.621
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is that all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were supposed to be paying </v>

2896
02:01:10.621 --> 02:01:13.981
<v Speaker 1>attention to the machines and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>event of nine slash 11 happened and </v>

2897
02:01:13.981 --> 02:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>because it was such a huge event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people are focusing on this.</v>

2898
02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And then that stopped being random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The event.</v>

2899
02:01:17.711 --> 02:01:22.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that people were all </v>

2900
02:01:22.711 --> 02:01:22.711
<v Speaker 1>focused on the same event affected these</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>

2901
02:01:22.711 --> 02:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2902
02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

2903
02:01:24.551 --> 02:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2904
02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:30.111
<v Speaker 1>And they found it the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also found out at a camp that was </v>

2905
02:01:30.111 --> 02:01:30.111
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister Trudeau,</v>

2906
02:01:30.111 --> 02:01:34.761
<v Speaker 1>his funeral in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when his son was giving the eulogy </v>

2907
02:01:34.761 --> 02:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an effect because you had almost every </v>

2908
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:38.810
<v Speaker 1>single person in Canada listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2909
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2910
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is really fascinating to me.</v>

2911
02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.830
<v Speaker 4>You familiar with ray?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kurt's we'll do,</v>

2912
02:01:45.831 --> 02:01:48.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the clarity is near when you know he's,</v>

2913
02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:53.980
<v Speaker 4>he's the number one proponent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of the intelligent computer </v>

2914
02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:56.450
<v Speaker 4>eventually taking over and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>he deems a singularity to be and what he</v>

2915
02:01:56.451 --> 02:01:58.970
<v Speaker 4>thinks is that what immortality is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

2916
02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:04.210
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be able to download your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness into some sort of a </v>

2917
02:02:04.210 --> 02:02:07.061
<v Speaker 4>computer and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds completely ridiculous until </v>

2918
02:02:07.061 --> 02:02:11.111
<v Speaker 4>you start thinking about the what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is consciousness and what </v>

2919
02:02:11.111 --> 02:02:11.440
<v Speaker 4>if they can recreate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would,</v>

2920
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have,</v>

2921
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:16.901
<v Speaker 4>you can recreate and create an </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial version of consciousness down</v>

2922
02:02:17.181 --> 02:02:22.181
<v Speaker 4>to the point of it being non local down </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point of this computer that </v>

2923
02:02:22.181 --> 02:02:25.310
<v Speaker 4>you've created being an antenna to tune </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this new sort of conscious.</v>

2924
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2925
02:02:26.261 --> 02:02:27.040
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2926
02:02:27.041 --> 02:02:32.041
<v Speaker 3>I remember once talking about computers </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to advance the rate they're </v>

2927
02:02:32.041 --> 02:02:35.191
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember if it was Chris that </v>

2928
02:02:35.191 --> 02:02:35.191
<v Speaker 3>puts for two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that,</v>

2929
02:02:35.191 --> 02:02:38.660
<v Speaker 3>that eventually there'll be a computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful enough to have stored in his </v>

2930
02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:42.931
<v Speaker 3>memory banks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single event that has occurred </v>

2931
02:02:42.931 --> 02:02:47.551
<v Speaker 3>since the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means like every event in every </v>

2932
02:02:47.551 --> 02:02:47.551
<v Speaker 3>human being's life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

2933
02:02:47.551 --> 02:02:52.050
<v Speaker 3>every interaction of matter throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe could be stored on a </v>

2934
02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:53.470
<v Speaker 3>single,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be extrapolated based on the current</v>

2935
02:02:53.471 --> 02:02:58.471
<v Speaker 3>events and his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that the program itself </v>

2936
02:02:58.471 --> 02:02:59.740
<v Speaker 3>would not be able to distinguish itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the original.</v>

2937
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So each of us would be programmed into </v>

2938
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:08.551
<v Speaker 3>this computer's memory bank and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>program of us would not be able to </v>

2939
02:03:09.101 --> 02:03:14.101
<v Speaker 3>distinguish itself from the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that right now we might </v>

2940
02:03:14.711 --> 02:03:17.620
<v Speaker 3>already be that program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A billion years in the future</v>

2941
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:21.380
<v Speaker 4>may very well be some sort of a parallel</v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

2942
02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we may have,</v>

2943
02:03:21.941 --> 02:03:26.941
<v Speaker 3>we may have lived our actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a carbon based life a billion years ago.</v>

2944
02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
<v Speaker 3>And right now we might just be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer program being run a billion </v>

2945
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:33.000
<v Speaker 3>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2946
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.730
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a mind fuck.</v>

2947
02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:39.820
<v Speaker 5>I saw a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a glitch in the matrix the other </v>

2948
02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:39.820
<v Speaker 5>day and this is kind of like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2949
02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:44.191
<v Speaker 5>I was outside in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the moon and there was these </v>

2950
02:03:44.191 --> 02:03:44.191
<v Speaker 5>clouds going over it after a rain storm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2951
02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.430
<v Speaker 5>And have you ever seen like on satellite</v>
<v Speaker 5>TV,</v>

2952
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:49.410
<v Speaker 5>like we're like darker scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like blacks and grays.</v>

2953
02:03:49.411 --> 02:03:51.920
<v Speaker 5>They're not just black or gray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like kinda like blocky,</v>

2954
02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:56.940
<v Speaker 5>like boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was looking at that and it was doing </v>

2955
02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:57.370
<v Speaker 5>that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why am I seeing blocky?</v>

2956
02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:59.990
<v Speaker 5>Like your eyes are programmed to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2957
02:03:59.991 --> 02:04:00.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2958
02:04:00.631 --> 02:04:05.631
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see so much computer and TV that was </v>

2959
02:04:05.631 --> 02:04:07.751
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was really like I was staring at </v>

2960
02:04:07.751 --> 02:04:07.751
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no reason those are squares.</v>

2961
02:04:07.751 --> 02:04:08.750
<v Speaker 5>Those are blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the shadowing was off.</v>

2962
02:04:08.751 --> 02:04:09.710
<v Speaker 5>And I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a second,</v>

2963
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.520
<v Speaker 5>this is some kind of say my friend </v>
<v Speaker 5>Duncan hit</v>

2964
02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:15.760
<v Speaker 4>me with the ultimate mindfuck once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is the theory that,</v>

2965
02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:17.810
<v Speaker 4>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2966
02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:22.860
<v Speaker 4>that your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as the world gets more and more </v>

2967
02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:23.860
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and more and more chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you worry about the future of the world,</v>

2968
02:04:24.070 --> 02:04:26.290
<v Speaker 4>that's really your own mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you're,</v>

2969
02:04:26.291 --> 02:04:27.550
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're tripping on that.</v>

2970
02:04:27.551 --> 02:04:31.030
<v Speaker 4>You have created this entire universe </v>
<v Speaker 4>around you.</v>

2971
02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:32.370
<v Speaker 4>And even though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2972
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:36.010
<v Speaker 4>it seems real because there's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in your life that also seem real.</v>

2973
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:41.310
<v Speaker 4>They in your dream as much as you exist </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there and it's all some sort of a </v>

2974
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:43.480
<v Speaker 4>symbiotic connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that you,</v>

2975
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.850
<v Speaker 4>you live and are reborn constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then every time something happens to</v>

2976
02:04:47.851 --> 02:04:52.851
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's some sort of a car </v>

2977
02:04:52.851 --> 02:04:52.851
<v Speaker 4>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some you know,</v>

2978
02:04:52.851 --> 02:04:52.851
<v Speaker 4>you die in a building,</v>
<v Speaker 4>collapsed.</v>

2979
02:04:52.851 --> 02:04:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Anything that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you immediately forget it,</v>

2980
02:04:56.220 --> 02:05:01.220
<v Speaker 4>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you are transported into another </v>

2981
02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:03.771
<v Speaker 4>situation where you already have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>life going on and you just step in and </v>

2982
02:05:03.771 --> 02:05:03.771
<v Speaker 4>just keep going.</v>

2983
02:05:03.771 --> 02:05:05.700
<v Speaker 4>And that it never ends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there is no death.</v>

2984
02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's just a constant cycle until you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get your shit together,</v>

2985
02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:12.000
<v Speaker 4>until you completely and totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved.</v>

2986
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:16.800
<v Speaker 4>And that this illusion that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>around for 40 years or 50 years,</v>

2987
02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:17.830
<v Speaker 4>it's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2988
02:05:17.831 --> 02:05:20.070
<v Speaker 4>you'd been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've been around forever.</v>

2989
02:05:20.071 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 4>That's the old soul notion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2990
02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:23.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2991
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.280
<v Speaker 4>we have a very limited amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>memories that we can,</v>

2992
02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:28.200
<v Speaker 4>can access about this life that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty sure happened,</v>

2993
02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:33.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and none of them that we can access </v>

2994
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.051
<v Speaker 4>during the sleep time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just imagine if someone came up with a </v>

2995
02:05:36.051 --> 02:05:38.100
<v Speaker 4>drug that would allow you to remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>your sleep and details.</v>

2996
02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Remember your dreams in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely didn't want to see half the </v>

2997

<v Speaker 4>even know that I'm dreaming about.</v>

3002
02:05:50.161 --> 02:05:52.740

<v Speaker 4>So David,</v>

3005
02:05:56.150 --> 02:05:58.620
<v Speaker 4>if anybody wants to go see you perform,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where can they,</v>

3006
02:05:58.650 --> 02:05:59.720
<v Speaker 4>how can they get ahold of you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know your,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've got facebook,</v>

3011
02:06:08.211 --> 02:06:13.211
<v Speaker 3>but that's kind of useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to get a website if </v>

3012
02:06:13.211 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just the twitter and a.</v>

3013
02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 3>and so</v>

3014
02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:17.660
<v Speaker 4>the plan is to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3015
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:21.740
<v Speaker 4>do some gigs to put together a set and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then go to her and then.</v>

3016
02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then actually start playing actual </v>

3017
02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:26.760
<v Speaker 3>comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you ready?</v>

3018
02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:29.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you felt like you did this thing the </v>

3019
02:06:29.731 --> 02:06:29.731
<v Speaker 3>other night?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would it have to go?</v>

3020
02:06:29.731 --> 02:06:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like I under,</v>

3021
02:06:30.431 --> 02:06:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I overestimated the amount of stuff that</v>

3022
02:06:33.101 --> 02:06:38.101
<v Speaker 3>I had in my notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was like about 15 minutes shy when </v>

3023
02:06:38.101 --> 02:06:38.101
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3024
02:06:38.101 --> 02:06:42.811
<v Speaker 3>then it went all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like I just sort of pulled out </v>

3025
02:06:42.811 --> 02:06:45.961
<v Speaker 3>some stuff I've been working okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had like a notes that I hadn't </v>

3026
02:06:45.961 --> 02:06:49.800
<v Speaker 3>timed outside as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is going to be about 45 </v>

3027
02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.940
<v Speaker 3>minutes of stuff in these notes and turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to be half an hour it true.</v>

3028
02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3029
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:53.590
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then,</v>

3030
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:58.820
<v Speaker 3>so then I had to sort of quickly just </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbed and other bits that I hadn't </v>

3031
02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:00.670
<v Speaker 3>planned to do as well as I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember it.</v>

3032
02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:03.070
<v Speaker 3>And then improvise a little digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>recorder set.</v>

3033
02:07:03.370 --> 02:07:03.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3034
02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

3035
02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:07.960
<v Speaker 4>your main motivation initially was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>financial,</v>

3036
02:07:08.050 --> 02:07:09.280
<v Speaker 4>but now you're enjoying it.</v>

3038
02:07:10.221 --> 02:07:13.490
<v Speaker 3>It's feels good to an extent not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a person who,</v>

3039

<v Speaker 3>dark,</v>

<v Speaker 3>horrible year and a half this past year </v>

<v Speaker 1>Standup is making me feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so a huge rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3089
02:08:42.230 --> 02:08:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and great just being on stage and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

3090
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:47.320
<v Speaker 1>remembering the reason I started doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3091
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>the reason that I liked doing it as that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to.</v>

3092
02:08:51.051 --> 02:08:56.051
<v Speaker 1>It's funny and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating positive energy and a </v>

3093
02:08:56.051 --> 02:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>positive environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're giving someone something,</v>

3094
02:08:57.810 --> 02:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you're changing their state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3095
02:08:59.710 --> 02:09:02.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just booked a pilot which is nice.</v>

3096
02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was a show called how to be a gentleman.</v>

3097
02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a good script and funny.</v>

3098
02:09:08.471 --> 02:09:13.471
<v Speaker 1>And so obviously these secret does work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I put out some positive energy </v>

3099
02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and now I got show.</v>

3100
02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining your body is so important.</v>

3101
02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3102
02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:23.330

<v Speaker 1>You and your body can betray you </v>

3103
02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:25.690
<v Speaker 1>whenever there's times of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those chemicals or they think you're</v>

3104
02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:27.520
<v Speaker 1>going to have to fight off a cheetah or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3105
02:09:27.521 --> 02:09:29.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemicals don't realize that,</v>

3106
02:09:29.801 --> 02:09:34.801
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3107
02:09:34.801 --> 02:09:34.801
<v Speaker 1>entanglement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

3108

<v Speaker 1>and I've spent most of my life going,</v>

3145
02:11:08.770 --> 02:11:13.770
<v Speaker 3>No having pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is nothing like having </v>

3146
02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:16.681
<v Speaker 3>children is absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I leave my dogs outside all the </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Can Die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can die now and a and I'll feel bad</v>

<v Speaker 3>suppressing that maternal instinct with </v>

3158
02:11:44.071 --> 02:11:44.590
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have a bunch of fucking cats or</v>
