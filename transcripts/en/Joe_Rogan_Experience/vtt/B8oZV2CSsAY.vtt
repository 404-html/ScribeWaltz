91
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.633
<v Speaker 1>art bell was the first time I heard a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terence McKenna outside of a building </v>

92
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>takes joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Bill Hicks joke.</v>

93
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said Kenneth,</v>

94
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.213
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about five grams of dried</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms or with Terence Mckenna would </v>

95
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>refer to as a heroic dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

96
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:57.791
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

97
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Who's terence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna?</v>

98
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>And I heard transfer can out in the art </v>
<v Speaker 1>bell show live what?</v>

99
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.333
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna had this crazy setup in </v>

100
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.174
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii where he lived in Kona on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain and he was totally off the </v>

101
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but way more than art bell.</v>

102
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.063
<v Speaker 1>He was in the jungle off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have these basins to catch </v>

103
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.523
<v Speaker 1>rainwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had several acres around him which </v>

104
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>was growing psychedelic plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a thousand books.</v>

105
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>He lived totally by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like a generator for power and he</v>

106
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>was completely off the grid and he built</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house there,</v>

107
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.753
<v Speaker 1>dude heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just up there writing and </v>

108
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.424
<v Speaker 1>tripping and then he would leave like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every six months he would take off and </v>

109
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:41.734
<v Speaker 1>leave for six months and just do these </v>
<v Speaker 1>tours where you would do these speaking </v>

110
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>things in like hippie places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>

111
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Texas and Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon and shit like that.</v>

112
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.113
<v Speaker 1>And they would gather around all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to listen to all this stuff and </v>

113
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>if you ever heard psychedelic salon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics salons,</v>

114
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great podcast and I just have.</v>

115
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I've had Lorenzo from psychedelic salon </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

116
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.133
<v Speaker 1>but it's all like old recordings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Timothy leary and Alan Watts are you </v>

117
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>related and I really wished that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to him.</v>

118
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That would be rather nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound and with an English accent,</v>

119
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>but he has all the mckenna recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of them,</v>

120
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>like way back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back through time.</v>

121
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>He plays them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna was W,</v>

122
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 1>which time period as sometimes get </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused with leary.</v>

123
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>He was posts Leery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was there.</v>

124
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 1>He was there during that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he came into prominence post leary.</v>

125
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his main psychedelic experiences</v>

126
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>were in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

127
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.534
<v Speaker 1>he had some really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really crazy mushroom trips with his </v>

128
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>brother Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an amazing guy.</v>

129
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Dennis is alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's alive.</v>

130
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He's been on this podcast several times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

131
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's actually a professor.</v>

132
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And Dennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

133
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.823
<v Speaker 2>like recounts all these tales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one time terence and Dennis went </v>

134
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 2>into the jungle and they took too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and Dennis completely lost his</v>

135
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went away for two weeks,</v>

136
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 2>for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just incoherent rambling.</v>

137
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:16.991
<v Speaker 2>Had some sort of a psychotic event and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like broke down.</v>

138
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 2>The nature of reality itself just went </v>
<v Speaker 2>way too deep.</v>

139
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>It was gone for like two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to watch him to watch over him.</v>

140
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.723
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like he was exposed to such </v>

141
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:28.184
<v Speaker 2>a complicated mathematical equation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it took him that long to figure it out </v>

142
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 2>and it came out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

143
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out.</v>

144
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

145
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:36.524
<v Speaker 2>terrance came up with the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stoned ape theory and it wasn't just </v>

146
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.494
<v Speaker 2>tenant terrence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was terrence along with a lot of </v>

147
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:45.434
<v Speaker 2>other psychedelic researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sort of formulated some of the </v>

148
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.883
<v Speaker 2>parts of this hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the parts of this hypothesis had to </v>

149
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:52.484
<v Speaker 2>deal with human beings evolving from </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower primates because the lower </v>

150
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:56.954
<v Speaker 2>primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're forced to try out new foods </v>

151
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.103
<v Speaker 2>because the rain forest were receding in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grasslands and all these undulate </v>

152
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

153
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 2>We're eating up all the plants as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're growing up.</v>

154
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 2>They were shitting and they were leaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>cow patties and in these cow patties,</v>

155
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 2>the mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we grow,</v>

156
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.750
<v Speaker 2>so these monkey people like things were </v>
<v Speaker 2>us that we're living in the trees.</v>

157
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 2>They were forced to test out new food </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources and it coincides.</v>

158
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:21.704
<v Speaker 2>It's theory coincides with climate data </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we know about changing of the </v>

159
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 2>temperatures back in Africa during that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

160
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.874
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in these particular regions and he </v>

161
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:34.470
<v Speaker 2>thinks that these lower primates started</v>
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with mushrooms.</v>

162
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:35.220
<v Speaker 2>It started eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.053
<v Speaker 2>the flip cow patties all the time to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>beetles and bugs and things along those </v>

164
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:39.434
<v Speaker 2>lines and so they will and they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick these mushrooms out to see if they </v>

165
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 2>could eat them well in low doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mushrooms enhanced visual acuity,</v>

166
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.283
<v Speaker 2>so it would help you be a better hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you more sensitive and it makes </v>

167
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.304
<v Speaker 2>you more horny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would make you more likely to </v>

168
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:55.064
<v Speaker 2>breed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'd be more likely to be a </v>

169
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 2>successful hunter and more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>breed.</v>

170
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.623
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

171
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a triple threat,</v>

172
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

173
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's outside of the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>

174
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:06.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The psychedelic effects of enhancing </v>

175
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 2>community of creative thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things that happen when you do</v>

176
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:11.714
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms in varying doses and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes that mushrooms are responsible </v>

177
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 2>for the doubling of the human brain size</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a period of 2 million years,</v>

178
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.640
<v Speaker 2>which is apparently the biggest mystery </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the fossil record.</v>

179
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so quick,</v>

180
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.243
<v Speaker 2>so it's a total departure and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>organ responsible for the fossil record </v>

181
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

182
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:32.744
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Understanding of what the fossil record </v>

183
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>and the reason why we're writing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff down.</v>

184
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.023
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's because of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will this mind doubled over a period of </v>

185
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:41.234
<v Speaker 2>2 million years and I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think is there's a bunch of </v>

186
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 2>different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

187
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.673
<v Speaker 2>people argue about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's really important to be </v>

188
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 2>balanced about this and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's either or.</v>

189
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a bunch of shit going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

190
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

191
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>If they think it had to do with humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out</v>

192
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.963
<v Speaker 1>fire and how to cook meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think cooking me allowed people to </v>

193
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>get more nutrients which allowed people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be healthier.</v>

194
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you can kill one animal,</v>

195
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:06.174
<v Speaker 1>you'd have more resources to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure things out and start thinking of </v>

196
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>shelters and weapons and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

197
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>various things that lead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

198
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>There's one theory that goes in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

199
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the throwing arm is another one.</v>

200
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we could throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

201
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>we could throw things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could hit shit.</v>

202
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.423
<v Speaker 1>There was nowhere near us like no other </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and then once we figured out </v>

203
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>spears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started like this,</v>

204
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>this ability to do this one thing might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have led us to enough free time to start</v>

205
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.233
<v Speaker 1>innovating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the brain as time went on favored </v>

206
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:36.564
<v Speaker 1>the ones who are more innovative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more more disciplined and more creative </v>

207
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and those are the ones that survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>

208
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously what we're rewarding </v>
<v Speaker 1>people today.</v>

209
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

210
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Fascinate hasn't gone away now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't go away at that totally </v>

211
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:50.960
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

212
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you in general the idea of awareness </v>

213
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>and consciousness as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a metaphor,</v>

214
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.034
<v Speaker 1>it's many people use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just like a computer operating </v>

215
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

216
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

217
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>consciousness experiencing itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely,</v>

218
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:05.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like that's like this form of an </v>

219
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:09.010
<v Speaker 1>operating system and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

220
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 1>We live in a binary of version of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate which,</v>

221
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.300
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of like a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>to them rediscover the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

223
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that that's not true.</v>

224
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.950
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also not true,</v>

225
00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to arrive at the paradox to that,</v>

226
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 1>the answer of the thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a paradox,</v>

227
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good joke.</v>

228
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:31.841
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

229
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're like,</v>

230
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>here's the setup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the punchline.</v>

231
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And so if somewhere when those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things collide in a group of people,</v>

232
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>it will trigger a reaction and if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>

233
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>laughter in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

234
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.113
<v Speaker 1>it's understanding of paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like feeling the effects of a </v>

235
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:52.014
<v Speaker 1>paradox where it actually like a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique moment of crazy thing that like </v>

236
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:57.803
<v Speaker 1>you didn't expect to experience because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so different than everything else </v>

237
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:02.020
<v Speaker 1>you experienced in everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:02.854
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everything and nothing </v>

239
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:04.464
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get that quick because a joe </v>

240
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>kind of does that at least in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

241
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:09.641
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

242
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you feel like it gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone a sense of enlightenment for,</v>

243
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

244
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:16.884
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a joke does it the way a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience that </v>

245
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.663
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like this weird moment when </v>

246
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you're laughing at someone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing.</v>

247
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

248
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you escape from your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shackles of your normal thinking.</v>

249
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.091
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

250
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:29.461
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

251
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:30.440
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you and you,</v>

252
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just a joyfulness because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get this perspective.</v>

253
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:35.484
<v Speaker 1>It's like such a zoomed out perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this thing in such a small incident </v>

254
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>of time that it just said it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on a ride,</v>

255
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're just suddenly there and</v>

256
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:45.524
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like when I've been talking </v>

257
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like that what's going on is</v>

258
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>like a form of hypnosis when a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like killing over a crowd.</v>

259
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.043
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like a form of hypnosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I always feel like when I'm </v>

260
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>watching someone on stage and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>really got me,</v>

261
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really thinking I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll kind of allowing them to think for</v>

262
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm just like sitting down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling and enjoying the ride.</v>

263
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>They take me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing any analyzing myself.</v>

264
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.433
<v Speaker 1>Especially that's like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why it's very important to like </v>

265
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.913
<v Speaker 1>really think carefully about people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention spans and how to get these </v>

266
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>ideas into their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is in a way,</v>

267
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.473
<v Speaker 1>it's like a state of mind that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve on stage that's very similar to </v>

268
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:28.040
<v Speaker 1>hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.003
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people or on Youtube and the idea of </v>

270
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.334
<v Speaker 1>what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the comedian as well because I </v>

271
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.631
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's my job to put all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces together and practice it and just</v>

272
00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:41.074
<v Speaker 1>tweak it and to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I get on stage and it starts </v>

273
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:43.444
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm as much of a passenger </v>

274
00:12:44.851 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 1>as I am the driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

275
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really great description.</v>

276
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that 100 percent.</v>

277
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes I'll say that the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I get on stage if I'm,</v>

279
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making music or even just like riffing </v>

280
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>or whatever is that I feel like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

281
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching the show or I'm actually </v>

282
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:07.330
<v Speaker 1>stepped out of myself and I'm actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of enjoying the show.</v>

283
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.570
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a moment where I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck right.</v>

284
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also doing now snap back in.</v>

285
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.430
<v Speaker 1>But in those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I.</v>

286
00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dig.</v>

287
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.353
<v Speaker 1>I dig that because it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just depends on where your </v>

288
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 1>awareness lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

289
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

290
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.473
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like the dude running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old school movie projector because </v>

291
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:28.774
<v Speaker 1>you're really just kind of turn it on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be there in case </v>

292
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>anything fucks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 1>For the most part it runs on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the movies?</v>

294
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a uh,</v>

295
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an operator.</v>

296
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:40.451
<v Speaker 1>There is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

297
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>there was just someone next to it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in case something fucked up.</v>

298
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when movies fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have to yell out.</v>

299
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember that.</v>

300
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are great.</v>

301
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

302
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck ups,</v>

303
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 1>the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the community.</v>

304
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:57.783
<v Speaker 1>That's a real test of character to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're talking to a movie </v>

305
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

306
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.074
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the kind of people that talk and </v>

307
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:04.744
<v Speaker 1>movie player during a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really know whether or not you </v>

308
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 1>can hang out with someone if they talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a movie.</v>

309
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

310
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if someone starts talking to the</v>

311
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:12.311
<v Speaker 1>movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

312
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're inconsiderate.</v>

313
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh totally.</v>

314
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Or unless like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:18.360
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this little secret that once,</v>

316
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.061
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

317
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:20.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brief comment,</v>

318
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't really mind so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

319
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 1>the secret get really quiet and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to their ear and don't whisper,</v>

320
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:29.990
<v Speaker 1>just speaking kind of a like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

321
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.070
<v Speaker 1>what am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

322
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Because the higher your whisper is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more siblings and everyone can</v>

323
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:37.384
<v Speaker 1>hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whispers are actually allowed to put </v>

324
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.493
<v Speaker 1>a hushed tone anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the people that just start talking </v>

325
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 1>about normal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

326
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 1>totally has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

327
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.103
<v Speaker 1>It'd be called Maki now you asshole.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a tough racket because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

349
00:15:58.761 --> 00:15:59.594
<v Speaker 1>I dunno some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously there are people that </v>

350
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:02.084
<v Speaker 1>have like this weird thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know that hangry thing or </v>

351
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bloodshot u,</v>

352
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 1>so then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of get crazy.</v>

353
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.623
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say for the most part it's about </v>

354
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.343
<v Speaker 1>discipline and the discipline turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>just nature and then you get a better </v>

355
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:19.880
<v Speaker 1>sense of how if you are hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

356
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry and that's fine.</v>

357
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be fine.</v>

358
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be hungry.</v>

359
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I can live for a few days without days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

360
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 1>So a few hours or four hours extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be fine.</v>

361
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about the guy that lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like more than 100 pounds by fasting for</v>

362
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>an entire year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a doctor's monitoring him.</v>

363
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It was all part of some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific experiment and we had to.</v>

364
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.130
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about him with Robb </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf.</v>

365
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.973
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that who was telling us about it or </v>

366
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>was it dom d'agostino?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like in the sixties or something?</v>

367
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

368
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:51.650
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fairly recently,</v>

369
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 1>fairly recently because the doctors were</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring him.</v>

370
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 1>He lost over 100 pounds and here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really crazy.</v>

371
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.880
<v Speaker 1>His skin shrunk with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his body corrected for itself,</v>

372
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.740
<v Speaker 1>which is like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he went into a complete state of</v>

373
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:10.574
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where his body is only fuel was </v>

374
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:13.484
<v Speaker 1>from the actual extra fat in his bio and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when his body started consuming </v>

375
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:18.044
<v Speaker 1>this mean he could have like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre genetics where skin doesn't </v>

376
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.590
<v Speaker 1>stretch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

377
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.573
<v Speaker 1>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

378
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.613
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred 50 pound man faster for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and he lost more than half his </v>

379
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:26.151
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

380
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened in 1965.</v>

381
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Was that the same one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if there's a recent photo,</v>

382
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.263
<v Speaker 1>because if rob lowe was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had all these color photos of </v>

383
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the guy that looked really recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be right,</v>

384
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a recent.</v>

385
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they recreated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what it was,</v>

386
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

387
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.260
<v Speaker 1>all he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

388
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.500
<v Speaker 1>is this the same one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same One.</v>

389
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm all</v>

390
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 3>he did was drink water and his body just</v>
<v Speaker 3>ate it's fat.</v>

391
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it took vitamins or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

392
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 3>He had to take some for some fiber </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they need stuff to go through,</v>

393
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.930
<v Speaker 3>so I wish Rob Wolf was here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure he's the one who told us</v>

394
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:01.764
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think was was the most shocking </v>

395
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 3>was that a skin trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

396
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

397
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

398
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean with weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost like 50,</v>

399
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 3>55 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

400
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started lifting.</v>

401
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:15.774
<v Speaker 3>I got a trainer and started lifting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then basically eating like a </v>

402
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:20.020
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just.</v>

403
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>

404
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.330
<v Speaker 3>they feel better that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

405
00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Way Better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy like crazy food.</v>

406
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Like people sometimes will look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>food that I'm bringing,</v>

407
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 3>which is always pretty much the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

408
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you eating?</v>

409
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for breakfast it's like this what I</v>

410
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 3>call the year or what he calls the Yogi </v>
<v Speaker 3>shake.</v>

411
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.693
<v Speaker 3>My trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has this shake that he that he digs </v>

412
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.900

<v Speaker 3>But the problem is there's a lot of </v>

424
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:15.474
<v Speaker 3>fucking dummies that also eat good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're annoying and for regular people </v>

425
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:19.764
<v Speaker 3>that want to be healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to be that annoying </v>

426
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

427

<v Speaker 3>The gym that's just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just droning on and on about his sets in</v>

428
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 3>his lifts and you start thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>being healthy is for idiots.</v>

429
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

430
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I know it gives it a bad rap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tells me that it's,</v>

431
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that,</v>

432
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:33.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

433
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 3>my favorite thing that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning,</v>

434
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 3>like lifting and sometimes they go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gold's on Saturday,</v>

435
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:39.894
<v Speaker 3>like as a treat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like we go to Gold's in Venice and </v>

436
00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 3>it's what I love about anything that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>get involved with is just observing like</v>

437
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.180
<v Speaker 3>how the system works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

438
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.970

<v Speaker 3>the community,</v>

439
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:53.760

<v Speaker 3>like what are they focused on,</v>

440
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 3>those types of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing I really dig about lifting</v>

441
00:19:56.821 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 3>is that it's not what you think.</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>

464
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.080
<v Speaker 3>You got to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

465
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 3>what would I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't do it.</v>

466
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.633
<v Speaker 3>There's guys that just have this idea in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their head that they need to absolutely </v>

467
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 3>tell you their knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

468
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.620
<v Speaker 3>it must come out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

469
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.510
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any can tell the difference because like</v>

470
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.353
<v Speaker 3>if someone's like giving you a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of corrective advice for an </v>

471
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.960
<v Speaker 3>exercise that you're doing in the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>or that you're doing.</v>

472
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.823
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a critique of the exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's more like I'm looking at you </v>

473
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:18.850
<v Speaker 3>doing this exercise and here's a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece that might make it more efficient,</v>

474
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.413
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better use of your movement or whatever </v>

475
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

476
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can get that right away.</v>

477
00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:25.871
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

478
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 3>that's dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try that.</v>

479
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 3>And if it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>

480
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:28.720
<v Speaker 3>If it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

481
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.583
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when someone's like going off on </v>

482
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:33.150
<v Speaker 3>these giant concepts like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

483
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.653
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just things that are too large to give </v>

484
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:40.500
<v Speaker 3>to someone that you don't know and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just start firing it out at you.</v>

485
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these physiological words.</v>

486
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

487
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know what the word I'm not.</v>

488
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to look stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

489
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

490
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.201
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

491
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

492
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

493
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:57.040
<v Speaker 3>sure man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks man.</v>

494
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that isolated my scapula reporting,</v>

495
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 3>but my superspinatus and all these words</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

496
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.660
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing here?</v>

497
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:06.503
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like you're jerking off on </v>
<v Speaker 3>me or tricking off on me with your </v>

498
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 3>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge jerking.</v>

499
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.893
<v Speaker 3>There is knowledge jerking right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure that they definitely </v>

500
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

501
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:16.774
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it gets grouped in with </v>

502
00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 3>mansplaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is like another form of.</v>

503
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 3>It's too generalized general human term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard he pete?</v>

504
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

505
00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:26.634
<v Speaker 3>it's that he peed is when a woman says </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and everybody ignores it and </v>

506
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:30.670
<v Speaker 3>the man says the exact same thing.</v>

507
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great idea.</v>

508
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

509
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I know what that is and that's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not like that.</v>

510
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.720
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Morris here loving.</v>

511
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Let me capitalize on an idea that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really delivered in the right timing</v>

512
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:47.681
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

513
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:49.520
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just going to claim </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

514
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Don't say debbie just had a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

515
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

516
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

517
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 3>A county person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

518
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Debbie just had a good idea as a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

519
00:22:57.341 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Hey everybody who had a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bad guys like.</v>

520
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

521
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.670
<v Speaker 3>And Debbie's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

522
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Thought?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Debbie doesn't know what to do.</v>

523
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.030
<v Speaker 3>This fucking job sucked yet totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

524
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.150
<v Speaker 3>I knew this guy was an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my proof.</v>

525
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.103
<v Speaker 3>That culture of like not like being in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate world and like one person is </v>

526
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:17.470
<v Speaker 3>the boss and the other people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to kiss his ass on the boss,</v>

527
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:20.400
<v Speaker 3>but then the boss has a boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regional boss was coming by,</v>

528
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 3>everybody tighten up and he's got to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tie on.</v>

529
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.373
<v Speaker 3>Know I know the only time that system </v>
<v Speaker 3>works is if the boss is a really good </v>

530
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 3>person and being a boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only time which is very,</v>

531
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:38.764
<v Speaker 3>very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super rare because they're playing </v>

532
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 3>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening.</v>

533
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to exist.</v>

534
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 3>You have to exist by while ignoring</v>

535
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.220
<v Speaker 1>all the trappings of bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

536
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.711
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

537
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:51.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just looking at like just from</v>

538
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.363
<v Speaker 1>a rational logistic like efficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>making mindset like you want you want </v>

539
00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 1>you want and what the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency also relates to the happiness</v>

540
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:03.560
<v Speaker 1>of the workers and their wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Coddling too much,</v>

541
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 1>but providing just the just the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of things,</v>

542
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:10.950
<v Speaker 1>plus a little bit extra to give it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grease that it needs to feel good.</v>

543
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Finding people to fill your team that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are likeminded or willing to like kind </v>

544
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:19.790
<v Speaker 1>of think that way where everybody kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of works together almost as a family.</v>

545
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

546
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.883
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure those jobs exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've talked to people who love </v>

547
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's people like that that are</v>

548
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 1>putting it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

549
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are companies and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>not there are moments when companies are</v>

550
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:31.064
<v Speaker 1>like that because everything changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it might not be sustainable if we </v>

551
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

552
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like to look at the worst aspects</v>

553
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:40.910
<v Speaker 1>of any point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

554
00:24:40.911 --> 00:24:45.911
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's climate change or a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential situation or race relations</v>

555
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.084
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always look at the worst aspects of </v>

556
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:49.334
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think overall it's pretty </v>

557
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:55.811
<v Speaker 1>undeniable this is the best time ever to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be alive in terms of healthcare,</v>

558
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:56.983
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the science behind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping people alive in terms of your </v>

559
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:01.574
<v Speaker 1>ability to get information in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to communicate with each </v>

560
00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:07.100
<v Speaker 1>other and bullshit to get through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To us.</v>

561
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It's way less likely to bullshit gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>through to people today.</v>

562
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Then the propaganda they could spew just</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like the 19 sixties.</v>

563
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get over on us.</v>

564
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 1>That's been the Gulf of Tonkin thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole thing,</v>

565
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.653
<v Speaker 1>the whole reason why we got into war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just think that if we can keep it </v>

566
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 1>together and we can keep going.</v>

567
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I think 40 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years from now that's going to.</v>

568
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.143
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to realize that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be the norm and that they're </v>

569
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>really healthy communities is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the norm and all these things.</v>

570
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:35.860
<v Speaker 1>This is like almost like a aberrations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

571
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:36.723
<v Speaker 1>when we look back in time and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who were kings and they had </v>

572
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:42.330
<v Speaker 1>people under them and they executed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at their own whim and that,</v>

573
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that only exists in a few places today.</v>

574
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like North Korea and like maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple other places.</v>

575
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in the future we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to move towards it.</v>

576
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard to see while we're in it,</v>

577
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 1>we're all moving towards a better way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

578
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

579
00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:57.644
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

580
00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.863
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go back to that I'm like the </v>

582
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:07.100
<v Speaker 1>reality awareness issue or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>

583
00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are multi verses and that every </v>

584
00:26:09.861 --> 00:26:12.170
<v Speaker 1>choice splits off and makes another </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice to make another choice.</v>

585
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:15.120
<v Speaker 1>So in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if just to,</v>

586
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 1>in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything is possible,</v>

587
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

588
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.483
<v Speaker 1>if the amount of realities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that exists are infinite </v>

589
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.210
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're perceiving one point,</v>

590
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

591
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:30.140
<v Speaker 1>whatever consciousness has experiment or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

592
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.183
<v Speaker 1>but as your point of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you move and every choice that you </v>

593
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:34.334
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually steer yourself to the </v>

594
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:36.860
<v Speaker 1>reality that you want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

595
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's,</v>

596
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 1>there's something great about seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory of what you just</v>

597
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 3>described and moving towards that </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

598
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 3>but being proactive in the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

599
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think really the.</v>

600
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 3>I think the thing that's really gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>help all of that is energy.</v>

601
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.573
<v Speaker 3>Like if we can figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribute energy so that it's more </v>

602
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 3>equal amongst all human beings on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet creating something.</v>

603
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:06.460
<v Speaker 3>You mean energy in terms of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual power,</v>

604
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.650
<v Speaker 3>electrical power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrical power.</v>

605
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would feel like there's a lot of </v>

606
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:11.874
<v Speaker 3>places in the earth that would benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>from some super advanced form of solar </v>

607
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 3>energy because if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

608
00:27:18.181 --> 00:27:19.014
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why even ever have power plants the why </v>

609
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>have any of that stuff can all be </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent and we don't totally rely on</v>

610
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 3>a grid either this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

611
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:26.851
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

612
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 3>It's distributed power is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the best power,</v>

613
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 3>especially if it is connected because </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have.</v>

614
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.810
<v Speaker 3>It can manage itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even if like,</v>

615
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and things like </v>

616
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:37.194
<v Speaker 3>that or just really good programming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just optimizes constantly in real </v>

617
00:27:40.961 --> 00:27:43.410
<v Speaker 3>time based on a sensor array when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

618
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:44.244
<v Speaker 3>they use really good back country solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>panels to charge batteries for cameras </v>

619
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.200
<v Speaker 3>and phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

620
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.970
<v Speaker 3>My friend Adam was in Montana and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Colorado,</v>

621
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idaho and Wyoming went on this epic back</v>

622
00:27:58.941 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 3>country hunt and one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he did is he brought this solar thing to</v>

623
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:03.624
<v Speaker 3>charge his phone every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do instastories from the top of the </v>

624
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:06.961
<v Speaker 3>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

625
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing stuff.</v>

626
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:10.770
<v Speaker 3>But that you couldn't do that just a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

627
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.783
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't the kind of solar power </v>

628
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:13.584
<v Speaker 3>that you could pack up and a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and stuff into your backpack and </v>

629
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:16.930
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

630
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was telling,</v>

631
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I was checking out.</v>

632
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a company out of Australia that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes these solar generators and they're</v>

633
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 3>like 17 grand or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe even.</v>

634
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the money would be more like 30 grand or</v>

635
00:28:26.411 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

636
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 3>it's this like fairly lightweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

637
00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:33.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like a master system that has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>base and um,</v>

638
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.850
<v Speaker 3>and a solar array and it tracks the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

639
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 3>so moves automatically with the sun and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it accounts,</v>

640
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:41.094
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also has some other preprogrammed </v>

641
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Speaker 3>weather data that's also integrated into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it either real time or stored.</v>

642
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 3>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

643
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 3>But it's able to produce like a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>decent amount of electricity.</v>

644
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:52.464
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was definitely way more than a </v>

645
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:56.180
<v Speaker 3>trickle charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

646
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.053
<v Speaker 3>you could almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could run a refrigeration system on </v>

647
00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:00.264
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a small refrigerator so you can </v>

648
00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:03.440
<v Speaker 3>keep food from perishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

649
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even get some air conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>going or something.</v>

650
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with a storage battery 20 years </v>

651
00:29:08.341 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 3>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows this shit.</v>

652
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:11.600
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

653
00:29:11.601 --> 00:29:13.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I just got done seeing that,</v>

654
00:29:13.901 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the documentary,</v>

655
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

656
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.263
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a kind of kind of conspiracy </v>

657
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fairly recent one.</v>

658
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:25.344
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fairly.</v>

659
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Steven Greer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

660
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sure it's on a,</v>

661
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.740
<v Speaker 3>it's on itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is featured on itunes.</v>

662
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can find it.</v>

663
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Like the unknown or some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

664
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems right.</v>

665
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And acknowledged it.</v>

666
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.610
<v Speaker 3>There's art belly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's asked.</v>

667
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.820
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of our belly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually our belly,</v>

668
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.170
<v Speaker 3>those are tough shows for me to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it makes sense,</v>

669
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 3>like some of the stuff that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

670
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.883
<v Speaker 3>And then that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my theory is that the level of </v>

671
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:05.260
<v Speaker 3>organization that they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really exist.</v>

672
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not that tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

673
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of messy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

674
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.073
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just look at kids on a playground </v>

675
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.253
<v Speaker 3>and see how they organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>socially and then just expand that with </v>

676
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more complexity or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity.</v>

677
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 3>And you have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of like the secrecy,</v>

678
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:26.100
<v Speaker 3>the structure of secrecy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

679
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

680
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 3>ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

681
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cults that have now risen,</v>

682
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rosa crucial ones and a masons and the </v>

683
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Illuminati in those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those types of things.</v>

684
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

685
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.030
<v Speaker 3>like that sort of thing does exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't exist in the tight,</v>

686
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 3>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled version.</v>

687
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's messier than that.</v>

688
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it's people trying to influence </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people using a bunch of tactics.</v>

689
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.150
<v Speaker 3>But I think that you can't have control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have that much control as,</v>

690
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.050
<v Speaker 3>as much control as they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

691
00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:05.884
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way that would work is if the </v>

692
00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:10.220
<v Speaker 3>government was different than people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they,</v>

693
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.770
<v Speaker 3>if they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't made,</v>

694
00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:16.120
<v Speaker 3>if people got totally wasn't people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were so smart that they weren't,</v>

695
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.920
<v Speaker 2>then that could be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But obviously that's not the case.</v>

696
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.843
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump is the fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have proof that the government is </v>

697
00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:27.740
<v Speaker 2>filled with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a person.</v>

698
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.530
<v Speaker 2>So person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no person has ever been able to pull off</v>

699
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.890
<v Speaker 2>that level of conspiracy for any length </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

700
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:42.090
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that you could hide somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication with aliens and the aliens</v>

701
00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:44.810
<v Speaker 2>would choose the government of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

702
00:31:44.811 --> 00:31:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Why would the aliens give a fuck who we </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked a popularity contest.</v>

703
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.603
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the representative that gets to </v>

704
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:53.360
<v Speaker 2>speak to Zeta reticular the fuck outta </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

705
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.830
<v Speaker 2>They talked to whoever they want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and check when we visit a bee colony.</v>

706
00:31:57.831 --> 00:32:02.831
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick on fucking secret contact.</v>

707
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Just suck some bees out with a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When to take them to a lab to test them.</v>

708
00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.073
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to go back to the need to go </v>

709
00:32:11.271 --> 00:32:12.104
<v Speaker 2>to the king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He imagined some fucking dudes sitting </v>

710
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:15.480
<v Speaker 2>in the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

711
00:32:15.481 --> 00:32:16.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Oval Office.</v>

712
00:32:16.891 --> 00:32:17.724
<v Speaker 2>And the alien walks in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the representative of the 19 </v>

713
00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.040
<v Speaker 2>forties movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

714
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

715
00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought,</v>

716
00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in like so many things.</v>

717
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So many infinite things can exist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are possible.</v>

718
00:32:33.141 --> 00:32:35.000
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are things that are just like,</v>

719
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.680
<v Speaker 2>it just makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

720
00:32:36.681 --> 00:32:39.170
<v Speaker 2>it intuitively you can feel some </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>

721
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.123
<v Speaker 2>It real like,</v>

722
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.113
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll leave a 10 percent margin of </v>

723
00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 3>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 3>like something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the ideas where I'm like I can't,</v>

725
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

726
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.710
<v Speaker 3>it could be real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen nothing that compels me to</v>

727
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 3>believe that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it could be real.</v>

728
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:54.254
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely not saying there are no </v>

729
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:57.620
<v Speaker 3>aliens with the government hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>contacted by aliens.</v>

730
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Aliens haven't visited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

731
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean why not do it?</v>

732
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

733
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's impossible.</v>

734
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:05.323
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not in to the extent at </v>

735
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 3>which when you compress all the data and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like formulate a story about it,</v>

736
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:14.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really unlikely.</v>

737
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

738
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.943
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

739
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.980
<v Speaker 3>it seems you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of have to do that.</v>

740
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:23.981
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't talk about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also seems super likely to me that in</v>

741
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 3>the future we won't send biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>entities into these places that have all</v>

742
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:31.160
<v Speaker 3>these limitations as far as what we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

743
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.620
<v Speaker 3>We'll send some sort of an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>

744
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those gray things,</v>

745
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 3>the big black eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe those are robots.</v>

746
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense.</v>

747
00:33:40.191 --> 00:33:41.024
<v Speaker 3>Within the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is my theory is that the whole </v>

748
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.050
<v Speaker 3>propulsion or compulsion to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

749
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.203
<v Speaker 3>to constantly be making technology is </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on our desire to make or build </v>

750
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 3>ourselves outside of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

751
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 3>So without the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the normal biological means,</v>

752
00:33:58.611 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like we're fascinated at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're fascinated at simulating ourselves</v>

753
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 3>outside of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in essence,</v>

754
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:08.710
<v Speaker 3>we could just be that already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

755
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.613
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like we're just like on this </v>

756
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:15.650
<v Speaker 3>constant carrot chasing a propulsion </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

757
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that when they </v>

758
00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 3>look at the image of the alien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

759
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:20.774
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at that image and they say </v>

760
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:22.754
<v Speaker 3>that it's entirely preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's someone who would achieve or </v>

761
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:26.234
<v Speaker 3>something would achieve a humanoid shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the massive amounts of </v>

762
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 3>different shapes that we have on earth.</v>

763
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to be mobile,</v>

764
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 3>that's not the only way to be mobile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>know we know how ours came to be that we</v>

765
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 3>used to be crawling and then we started </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up.</v>

766
00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we have all these issues with</v>

767
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:44.174
<v Speaker 3>our spine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spine wasn't entirely designed to </v>

768
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 3>support upper body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

769
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

770
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:50.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

771
00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.554
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is it's one of my pet </v>
<v Speaker 3>peeves and just putting this into the </v>

772
00:34:55.461 --> 00:34:58.490
<v Speaker 3>spectrum of science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

773
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 3>every celestial body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every planet,</v>

774
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>every moon had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all have different gravity's.</v>

775
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's going to be different types </v>

776
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:07.550
<v Speaker 3>of creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

777
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:08.384
<v Speaker 3>but when they come to our planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is going to need a really strong </v>

778
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.963
<v Speaker 3>exoskeleton suit or they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>so incredibly strong that it wouldn't </v>

779
00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:16.190
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

780
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.720
<v Speaker 3>atmospheric gases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all you know,</v>

781
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.450
<v Speaker 3>like how they produce energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

782
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.373
<v Speaker 3>There's such a vast complexity that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is the way that it is now because </v>

783
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:28.274
<v Speaker 3>of all of the elements that were present</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the Times that they were present in </v>

784
00:35:31.581 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 3>our reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

785
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.270
<v Speaker 3>and even if you take it on a software </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

786
00:35:35.271 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 3>like something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was that game spore,</v>

787
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was like,</v>

788
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.560
<v Speaker 3>it was built on like generative entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>university and they would and they would</v>

789
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:45.864
<v Speaker 3>kind of create on their own based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>like your light touch and it would be </v>

790
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:49.620
<v Speaker 3>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

791
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:51.840
<v Speaker 3>didn't you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That got boring though,</v>

792
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 3>because there's really nothing happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these infinite.</v>

793
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a no,</v>

794
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no man's sky.</v>

795
00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.491
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

796
00:35:58.491 --> 00:35:58.771
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

797
00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>No Man's sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So similar idea.</v>

798
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

799
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:03.440
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to really,</v>

800
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with those things is,</v>

801
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I know we're jumping around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

802
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.890
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole show is the show.</v>

803
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We jump around and were like,</v>

804
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.163
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when should we start talking about </v>

805
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:14.911
<v Speaker 3>whatever?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

806
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 3>totally good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

807
00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 3>There's ain't no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>

808
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is what is this?</v>

809
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>These are creatures just came out like </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 10,</v>

810
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just dope.</v>

811
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.513
<v Speaker 3>It starts super small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little one celled organisms and works </v>

812
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:29.454
<v Speaker 3>all the way up to a organism getting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>land and then you're really running a </v>

813
00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 3>whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when these,</v>

814
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 3>these things are happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these little fuckers evolve.</v>

815
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 3>They evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can design,</v>

816
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 3>you can design them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

817
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 3>And what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are your tasks?</v>

818
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.483
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to fight and survive or </v>

819
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.123
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you can get lost in these fucking </v>

820
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.470
<v Speaker 3>puddings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

821
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Then you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now there's like tribal culture with</v>

822
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:53.184
<v Speaker 3>a hierarchical leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now are these other things you're </v>

823
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.573
<v Speaker 3>interacting with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Artificial or the other humans playing </v>

824
00:36:59.050 --> 00:36:59.670
<v Speaker 3>games all.</v>

825
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was multiplayer online stuff.</v>

826
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:04.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so basically you have all the way to </v>

827
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:07.980
<v Speaker 3>space fairing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so cool looking.</v>

828
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 3>They beat the fuck out of each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>with sticks though.</v>

829
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get past that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

830
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

831
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.103
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

832
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.080
<v Speaker 3>See that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about that makes us,</v>

833
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.320
<v Speaker 3>that's what I call human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human race simulation species.</v>

834
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we do,</v>

835
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:22.914
<v Speaker 3>we generate our ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all based on like our </v>

836
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:29.280
<v Speaker 3>observation of the world around us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then utilizing that in some way for our,</v>

837
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 3>for ourselves and so like know design of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

838
00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:37.620
<v Speaker 3>why we color things the way they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain chemicals or why things are,</v>

839
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look the way they look or the shape,</v>

840
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:44.700
<v Speaker 3>the way they're shaped all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I see a game about simulation,</v>

841
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 3>of course we're going to make simulation</v>
<v Speaker 3>a game about simulations,</v>

842
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:54.030
<v Speaker 3>arguably a like children playing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolls and figures and stuff like that.</v>

843
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.863
<v Speaker 3>It's another form of simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of like having the </v>

844
00:37:56.821 --> 00:37:57.654
<v Speaker 3>awareness of another reality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>projecting the idea that you want more </v>

845
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 3>with bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess some more control.</v>

846
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:07.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having control over representation </v>

847
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:12.980
<v Speaker 3>of your idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a desired reality is crazy.</v>

848
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.330
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like,</v>

849
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 3>that's like simulation within </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulation,</v>

850
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.020
<v Speaker 3>within simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within.</v>

851
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.860
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally a,</v>

852
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice piece of evidence for that.</v>

853
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to get better at it </v>

854
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.770
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to get into certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

855
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:25.703
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be able to put some </v>
<v Speaker 3>headphones on and they're going to plug </v>

856
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:29.460
<v Speaker 3>some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe put some,</v>

857
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.600
<v Speaker 3>some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

858
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.470
<v Speaker 3>greasy pads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some wires,</v>

859
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 3>some wetware yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to stuff connected</v>

860
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>to your head and all these various </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

861
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.290
<v Speaker 1>They're going to hook you up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine and you're going to go somewhere</v>

862
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 1>that's so much cooler than reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be like,</v>

863
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 1>fuck reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

864
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.460
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna,</v>

865
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go and do your stupid job at home depot.</v>

866
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this job.</v>

867
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna come home and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put that thing on.</v>

868
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I have to figure out a way to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

869
00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Stay in the world like surrogate tron </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

870
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 1>What surrogates recut the movie a Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 1>Willis.</v>

871
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

872
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

873
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.890
<v Speaker 1>It was all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all about telepresence.</v>

874
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 1>So people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in pods,</v>

875
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's Kinda like a robot bottom.</v>

876
00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were people like jumping off </v>

877
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 1>of buildings and shit because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

878
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 1>There were no consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they looked like underneath.</v>

879
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

880
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freaky surrogate robot.</v>

881
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Willis was younger.</v>

882
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.420
<v Speaker 1>There was like one of the first uses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>CGI to,</v>

883
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>to make someone younger in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

884
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

885
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.080
<v Speaker 1>look how beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His skin looked.</v>

886
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Very smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super smooth.</v>

887
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.000
<v Speaker 1>They just did that recently with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

888
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.040
<v Speaker 1>guardians of the galaxy two with who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Russell Kurt.</v>

889
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Russell is the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

890
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feet of the one time that I noticed </v>

891
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the most was Tron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neutral.</v>

892
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

893
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I remember that being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>espouses this breakthrough to.</v>

894
00:40:01.721 --> 00:40:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean Benjamin Button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fake,</v>

895
00:40:03.661 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 1>just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked fake as fuck.</v>

896
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:06.544
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a simulation in the fact that </v>

897
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A video game still looks fake within the</v>

898
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

899
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looked amazing.</v>

900
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Simple dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked perfect.</v>

901
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked really good.</v>

902
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

903
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:21.220
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks.</v>

904
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.270
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a 35 year old Kurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell was fucking incredible.</v>

905
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.990
<v Speaker 1>It looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is really good.</v>

906
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.960
<v Speaker 1>And the movie's Funny Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

907
00:40:28.961 --> 00:40:30.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about too.</v>

908
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

909
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that really pissed me off </v>

910
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 1>was that baby groot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate when they put baby characters.</v>

911
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't stand it.</v>

912
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.580
<v Speaker 1>It's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an obvious play.</v>

913
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

914
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 1>remember it is obvious when mark and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindy,</v>

915
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:50.680
<v Speaker 1>when they add a Jonathan winters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

916
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't afraid of obvious things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are awesome,</v>

917
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.470
<v Speaker 1>like big tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worked once.</v>

918
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different thing,</v>

919
00:40:58.361 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different thing,</v>

920
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but obvious things that are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

921
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 1>there's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that little baby groot was cute.</v>

922
00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I could not stand that opening sequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like the,</v>

923
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.860
<v Speaker 1>he's like being casual and he's taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>out all the bad guys and I'm like,</v>

924
00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought when I was singing.</v>

925
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with the,</v>

926
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the opening sequence.</v>

927
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a long joke.</v>

972
00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 3>It takes like seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The setup,</v>

973
00:43:02.001 --> 00:43:02.834
<v Speaker 3>it's just him talking about how he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked with Angley and at the end of </v>

974
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 3>this interview he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ang Lee,</v>

975
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.180
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't like me when I'm Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something actually not getting it.</v>

976
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.823
<v Speaker 3>And then him explaining the whole lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>up back to that again and then not </v>

977
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.180
<v Speaker 3>getting it and explaining it again and </v>

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

979
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm remembering it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's just brilliant man.</v>

980
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:34.943
<v Speaker 3>It's such an abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird slice of a way to get to a </v>

981
00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 3>punchline and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perfect.</v>

982
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.983
<v Speaker 3>A Hog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a punchline that's a hulk of arguably </v>

983
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:44.630
<v Speaker 3>the worst hulk movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

984
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

985
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:49.430
<v Speaker 3>The West Eric Bana one who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved him in chopper,</v>

986
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't love them as Bruce Banner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

987
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:52.814
<v Speaker 3>Even though it was last name was banner </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought that's pretty close to </v>

988
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 3>banner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't do it.</v>

989
00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.130
<v Speaker 3>You know why terrible Bonnie on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

990
00:43:58.131 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 3>I went to see it high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you see high movies,</v>

991
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 3>bad movies just like or offensive when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're high.</v>

992
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you make believe?</v>

993
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.490
<v Speaker 3>But I know I'm aware of the illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're casting wizard.</v>

994
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>

995
00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they had hot dogs in that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

996
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't service it was like three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or two headed dogs.</v>

997
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Was that two headed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was a dog.</v>

998
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it had more than one head.</v>

999
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I think because it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nick nolte,</v>

1000
00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:28.630
<v Speaker 3>his dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the dad.</v>

1001
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Remember he was a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad?</v>

1002
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:31.154
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1003
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.240
<v Speaker 3>They turn into a jellyfish</v>

1004
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.630
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one returning to jellyfish.</v>

1005
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.900
<v Speaker 1>At the end he had jellyfish dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>

1006
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1007
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they weren't holding down poodle in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel pistol.</v>

1008
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird look at them.</v>

1009
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.333
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a strange thing going to be facing </v>

1010
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.640
<v Speaker 1>down poodle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>

1011
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1012
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that happened.</v>

1013
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:59.070
<v Speaker 1>It essentially turned into the hulk </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus a hog dog,</v>

1014
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:00.083
<v Speaker 1>so when the dogs would get fired up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing would happen to them as </v>

1015
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 1>happened to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hulk dogs get bigger.</v>

1017
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.983
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bite them on the back and didn't he get </v>

1018
00:45:08.191 --> 00:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>bigger depending upon how much fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit was happening in his life.</v>

1019
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:13.933
<v Speaker 1>Like he shot him with bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept getting bigger and bigger and </v>

1020
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1021
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1022
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:19.194
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1023
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:19.871
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1024
00:45:19.871 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 1>because he just keeps absorbing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

1025
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in the nuclear plant matter,</v>

1026
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.010
<v Speaker 1>it just kept getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1027
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Could you fucking imagine like of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the superpowers,</v>

1028
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that I think so appeals </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kids like me when I was young,</v>

1029
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I was little and worried about the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nervous and you know,</v>

1030
00:45:40.451 --> 00:45:41.284
<v Speaker 1>you get picked on you like how cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be to just be able to just get </v>

1031
00:45:45.001 --> 00:45:45.834
<v Speaker 1>angry and all of a sudden become this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof thing that can leak through </v>

1032
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most.</v>

1033
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was so corny,</v>

1035
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.890
<v Speaker 1>like the words that he would say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1036
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.650
<v Speaker 1>You could only read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1037
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:04.290
<v Speaker 1>It as a comic book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're reading a comic book,</v>

1038
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:09.350
<v Speaker 1>it's different than when you hear people</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking like the avengers when he takes</v>

1039
00:46:09.661 --> 00:46:10.220
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1040
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Loci loci pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck out of him.</v>

1041
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 1>He knew human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1042
00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.553
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1043
00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1044
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you saw the 19 seventies hulk,</v>

1045
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Lou ferrigno just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean comic,</v>

1046
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.680
<v Speaker 1>like just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's beating the fuck out of Blokey</v>

1047
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.933
<v Speaker 1>bloke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like,</v>

1048
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.223
<v Speaker 1>like kind of fucked up and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because just being emotionless and said </v>

1049
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:35.430
<v Speaker 1>that you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1050
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.353
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say that he would definitely </v>

1051
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:38.700
<v Speaker 1>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's cool.</v>

1052
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that you could </v>

1053
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 1>only read people saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.590
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Annie Cap.</v>

1055
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one says,</v>

1056
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Capp.</v>

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a blast from the past.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is there any more cartoons?</v>

1059
00:46:56.761 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Are there any more dilbert's out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world?</v>

1060
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean like hand drawn comic </v>
<v Speaker 1>strips?</v>

1061
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 1>They're big ones that people like look </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to everyday.</v>

1062
00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.600

<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1066
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:12.003
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who the fuck reads newspapers </v>

1067
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:14.430

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1069
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and online publications,</v>

1070
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 1>unless it's The new yorker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you usually don't do,</v>

1071
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic strips.</v>

1072
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.843
<v Speaker 1>It's just the articles and if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably like a one off by an </v>

1073
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Speaker 1>artist rather than a series like Andy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Capp or Dilbert or,</v>

1074
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1075
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.153
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe a one off with Obama and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump standing next to each other </v>

1076
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:35.780
<v Speaker 1>talking or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1078
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like playboy style picture.</v>

1079
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 1>The punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joke underneath.</v>

1080
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:42.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember those playboy ones where </v>

1081
00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1082
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a little kid.</v>

1083
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Get Ahold of them and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck am I reading right now?</v>

1084
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.203
<v Speaker 1>General,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tits popping out and the guys </v>

1085
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 1>trying to grab her and it's humor.</v>

1086
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Adult humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adult humor,</v>

1087
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.664
<v Speaker 1>but today it's totally rape culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of shit that was in playboy </v>

1088
00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:01.354
<v Speaker 1>magazine and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ads that if you saw or those </v>

1089
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:06.160
<v Speaker 1>cartoons rather than as you saw today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1090
00:48:06.161 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you can't print this because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking way.</v>

1091
00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.650
<v Speaker 1>No way is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

1092
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it as bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1093
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1094
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I was just gonna say this is as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey Rooney in breakfast at Tiffany's.</v>

1095
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1096
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 1>that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean watch it,</v>

1097
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as Mickey Rooney's character</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes on,</v>

1098
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which doesn't really know.</v>

1099
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.524
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breakfast at tiffany's is like one of </v>

1100
00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>those movies you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about all the time,</v>

1101
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but you may not ever see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 1>That might be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1103
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.293
<v Speaker 1>I might not have ever seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember trying to see it and I </v>

1104
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.240
<v Speaker 1>couldn't.</v>

1105
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't finish it because of Mickey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rooney.</v>

1106
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.420
<v Speaker 1>He plays a Chinese man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1107
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.570
<v Speaker 1>That's running Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese is Japanese stores.</v>

1108
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.490
<v Speaker 1>You wearing a Japanese thing saying he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese says Mr.</v>

1109
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Jeff [inaudible] Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least I thought I was going to get</v>

1111
00:49:05.711 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 1>really terrible with like mixing Asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>

1112
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.163
<v Speaker 1>but apparently you remember when Katie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Perry had apologized for wearing a </v>

1113
00:49:13.991 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 1>kimono because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1114
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.533
<v Speaker 1>people felt like it was offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese people that she was culturally </v>

1115
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:20.410
<v Speaker 1>appropriating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1116
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 1>had this big sit down with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about her.</v>

1117
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:27.183
<v Speaker 1>One of her album covers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a different time when it was </v>

1118
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:30.281
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1119
00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1120
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1121
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Last grandmother died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1122
00:49:34.851 --> 00:49:35.684
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1123
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 1>she had apologized and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was apologizing,</v>

1124
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.750
<v Speaker 1>remember she made this video that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>make your fucking brain hurt.</v>

1125
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.570
<v Speaker 1>She's sitting there with a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say,</v>

1126
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Maxon from black lives matter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sitting on a couch,</v>

1127
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:51.730
<v Speaker 1>cross legged with their shoes off.</v>

1128
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows.</v>

1129
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.883
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you sit down that like that with </v>

1130
00:49:55.661 --> 00:49:56.051
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1131
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing here?</v>

1132
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:58.463
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's trying to be comfortable with it </v>

1133
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.140
<v Speaker 1>looks weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible setup.</v>

1134
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.003
<v Speaker 1>How about we just give us a comfy chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit here and talk to each other like </v>

1135
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.023
<v Speaker 1>fucking humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be different if they were on </v>

1136
00:50:06.961 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>like kind of organic looking furniture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were dressed more as like human</v>

1137
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1138
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1139
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was addressing other hair.</v>

1140
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 1>This was the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a dress her hair because she did</v>

1141
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:20.434
<v Speaker 1>something where she had braids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were getting mad at her because </v>

1142
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:25.450
<v Speaker 1>she culturally appropriate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she also addressed her,</v>

1143
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>her idea of dressing like a</v>

1144
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.873
<v Speaker 2>geisha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the problem is when they went over </v>

1145
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and talked to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geishas are from,</v>

1146
00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.120
<v Speaker 3>we're geishas from.</v>

1147
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Why don't want to say China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

1148
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Japan is Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1149
00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like the thing that people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

1150
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.823
<v Speaker 2>So they went over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the braids and she had </v>

1151
00:50:48.421 --> 00:50:50.880
<v Speaker 2>apologized for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's her Katy Perry.</v>

1152
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked good.</v>

1153
00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.200
<v Speaker 2>She's no good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1154
00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:59.340
<v Speaker 2>so they went over to Japan to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these folks and they universally,</v>

1155
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.233
<v Speaker 2>we're saying when the interviewed people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the street that they're happy that </v>

1156
00:51:01.741 --> 00:51:02.574
<v Speaker 2>someone is expressing Japanese culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they're aware of Japanese </v>

1157
00:51:04.921 --> 00:51:05.754
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they thought it was a very good </v>

1158
00:51:06.751 --> 00:51:08.400
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't think it was interesting,</v>

1159
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:09.343
<v Speaker 2>like they don't have the same feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>about cultural appropriation as some </v>

1160
00:51:11.821 --> 00:51:13.950
<v Speaker 2>people do with fucking braids.</v>

1161
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:51:16.001 --> 00:51:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1163
00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1164
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.860
<v Speaker 3>We're sending it over super sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've gotten very expensive.</v>

1165
00:51:20.861 --> 00:51:21.694
<v Speaker 3>You know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all comes from a litigious culture </v>

1166
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1167
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.063
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you can get sued for </v>

1168
00:51:28.451 --> 00:51:30.450
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can sue you at anytime.</v>

1169
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.170
<v Speaker 3>That's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's American culture.</v>

1170
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.430
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1171
00:51:33.431 --> 00:51:34.264
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pissed off someone like enough you </v>

1172
00:51:36.971 --> 00:51:39.520
<v Speaker 3>can sue them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a lot of like swimming,</v>

1173
00:51:39.521 --> 00:51:40.354
<v Speaker 3>swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming and enough successful cases </v>

1174
00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:43.720
<v Speaker 3>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of,</v>

1175
00:51:43.721 --> 00:51:48.430
<v Speaker 3>it's like a fear based operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calling people on Shit.</v>

1176
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they didn't even think was bad </v>

1177
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:51.783
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a combination of like someone like </v>

1178
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a good service to be able to sue </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone if you need it to.</v>

1179
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.770
<v Speaker 3>However it's abused of the hanging and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's professional lawyers.</v>

1180
00:51:59.771 --> 00:52:00.910
<v Speaker 3>They have billboards everywhere.</v>

1181
00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.920
<v Speaker 3>But do you think Katy Perry was worried </v>
<v Speaker 3>about being sued?</v>

1182
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.083
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that I'm saying that the </v>

1183
00:52:05.081 --> 00:52:08.320
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity is like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why we're so,</v>

1184
00:52:08.321 --> 00:52:12.520
<v Speaker 3>what American culture is so pc at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

1185
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.730
<v Speaker 3>because there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of goes hand in hand.</v>

1186
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1187
00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.081
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1188
00:52:19.081 --> 00:52:20.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm at a loss and a little bit to stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1189
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.873
<v Speaker 3>but I will say it's it having that </v>
<v Speaker 3>litigious fear based kind of motivator </v>

1190
00:52:26.951 --> 00:52:31.870
<v Speaker 3>or it causes people to want to correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like to course correct,</v>

1191
00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:32.733
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1192
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.600
<v Speaker 3>to a form of something that works for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone to avoid being sued too.</v>

1193
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not directly,</v>

1194
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.380
<v Speaker 3>not directly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that thought process.</v>

1195
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mindset.</v>

1196
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mindset.</v>

1197
00:52:43.391 --> 00:52:45.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that's because it's about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1198
00:52:45.551 --> 00:52:49.060
<v Speaker 3>well how can we make this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to include everybody on this,</v>

1199
00:52:49.061 --> 00:52:51.910
<v Speaker 3>which I believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but absolutely.</v>

1200
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.013
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1201
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think it should be done out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of empathy,</v>

1202
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:57.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not to say that,</v>

1203
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:58.690
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1204
00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:59.583
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people fighting for rights to have </v>

1205
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:03.250
<v Speaker 3>handicap parking in the front of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

1206
00:53:03.251 --> 00:53:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a great idea.</v>

1207
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:09.700
<v Speaker 3>But like I'm just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what we were kind of referring to,</v>

1208
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.863
<v Speaker 3>that sensitivity come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from that where someone's like </v>

1209
00:53:13.031 --> 00:53:13.864
<v Speaker 3>afraid of doing something wrong and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just starts feeding back and feeding </v>

1210
00:53:16.751 --> 00:53:17.531
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding back,</v>

1211
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:20.800
<v Speaker 3>and then you get people so fearful of </v>
<v Speaker 3>any choice that they're making.</v>

1212
00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1213
00:53:22.901 --> 00:53:24.730
<v Speaker 3>every time I walk into a grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1214
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 3>this entire store</v>

1215
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:30.120
<v Speaker 1>could be reduced to five percent the </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume that it,</v>

1216
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.013
<v Speaker 1>that it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the amount of people in that store </v>

1217
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:35.840
<v Speaker 1>would have all the products they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1218
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So the inundation of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

1219
00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:40.381
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

1220
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 1>choice and fear of doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1221
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's because I love to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect or I want to look perfect,</v>

1222
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:49.043
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all mix that all together and it's </v>

1223
00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>a recipe for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fabulous for sure.</v>

1224
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.153
<v Speaker 1>I think another factor though is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get to complain and that people </v>

1225
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:04.110
<v Speaker 1>don't like when people are mad at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a giant group of people</v>

1226
00:54:04.111 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 1>that can communicate instantaneously </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1227
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.643
<v Speaker 1>with anybody at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get more prevalence of </v>

1228
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:12.984
<v Speaker 1>complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same percentage of people are </v>

1229
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 1>complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't able to access everyone</v>

1230
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 1>as they were to get to Katy Perry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch about her wearing braids.</v>

1231
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the past,</v>

1232
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:25.980
<v Speaker 1>like in the low derek days and bowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derek wore braids and 10,</v>

1233
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.190
<v Speaker 1>which is really for that was that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody was wearing those,</v>

1234
00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 1>seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on that level.</v>

1235
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean was that a thing in black culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then and the Bo Derek days?</v>

1236
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like braids?</v>

1237
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Cornrows thinks since I think the slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1238
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Some days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1239
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.410
<v Speaker 1>But brands have also been in almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>every culture braids for sure.</v>

1240
00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:49.920
<v Speaker 1>But those crazy cornrows like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those that,</v>

1241
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 1>that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1242
00:54:51.631 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 1>that was a direct reference I think to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Lord,</v>

1243
00:54:53.941 --> 00:54:58.941
<v Speaker 1>she was Caribbean spooky hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ruined your life.</v>

1244
00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 1>She was next door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

1245
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.603
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't get anything done if you </v>

1246
00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:04.284
<v Speaker 1>were banging her very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you would have to like keep </v>

1247
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:07.374
<v Speaker 1>an eye on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are All the time were you going to stay </v>

1248
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 1>put?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1249
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:11.873
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time if you learn to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely confident next to someone </v>

1250
00:55:15.241 --> 00:55:17.220
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean come on.</v>

1251
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:22.250
<v Speaker 1>That's like Max good fucking luck when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't pull it off.</v>

1252
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't hold it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1253
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have no problem.</v>

1254
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:28.913
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to not want to fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to like be married and happy </v>

1255
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 1>and successful and not want to fuck her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like really just be comfortable</v>

1256
00:55:37.441 --> 00:55:38.274
<v Speaker 1>being around her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think just because you want to </v>

1257
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:40.344
<v Speaker 1>have sex on that possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility to fuck someone that's </v>

1258
00:55:44.371 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 1>that hot is always a problem for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially back then.</v>

1259
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1260
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think the initial making a move</v>

1261
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:54.624
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think like obviously if you get </v>

1262
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 1>used to someone and their personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1263
00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.610
<v Speaker 1>it starts to calibrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1264
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just a better person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better person to go around her.</v>

1265
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could,</v>

1266
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 1>if she were great it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1267
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:07.460
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could.</v>

1268
00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.200
<v Speaker 1>If she had a great attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a positive person.</v>

1269
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You just want her to like you more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

1270
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1271
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:14.620
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

1272
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:15.503
<v Speaker 1>I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1273
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I've just said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying,</v>

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.040
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

1275
00:56:20.041 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I take that as a personal challenge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1276
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:22.411
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1277
00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:26.270
<v Speaker 1>How can I be confident around her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set it up,</v>

1278
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust me.</v>

1279
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that,</v>

1280
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.770
<v Speaker 1>that this complaining thing is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

1281
00:56:34.771 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 1>So nobody likes to have people mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1282
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people get mad at people.</v>

1283
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 1>This is why people get mad at people </v>
<v Speaker 1>over nothing.</v>

1284
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 1>They love to find someone who fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get mad.</v>

1285
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

1286
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:50.071
<v Speaker 1>the Anthony Bordain casual response that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had at the airport by TMZ that became</v>

1287
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 1>this huge thing where they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a serve dinner to Kim Jong Un</v>

1288
00:56:54.461 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 1>and Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you serve?</v>

1289
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemlock.</v>

1290
00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And they walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>

1291
00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Every time it's a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>

1292
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I was reading all the responses</v>
<v Speaker 1>on tmz about,</v>

1293
00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:08.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1294
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.540
<v Speaker 1>get the secret service on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's threatening Podesta,</v>

1295
00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1296
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really where we,</v>

1297
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.113
<v Speaker 1>it's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are really offended by that </v>

1298
00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.253
<v Speaker 1>really offends you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were a such a monumental pussy </v>

1299
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.833
<v Speaker 1>that you deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't deserve to have an opinion on </v>

1300
00:57:24.581 --> 00:57:25.414
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that really bothered you to your </v>

1301
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:30.190
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he's threatening potus.</v>

1302
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.173
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are such a fucking baby that you </v>

1303
00:57:33.581 --> 00:57:35.260
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be allowed to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1304
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't get in,</v>

1305
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.400
<v Speaker 1>can't get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed.</v>

1306
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And there was hundreds of those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were commenting on the TMZ thing.</v>

1307
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:43.803
<v Speaker 1>And I realized like this is just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of people being able to </v>

1308
00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 1>communicate openly better.</v>

1309
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.313
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting so many moments that </v>

1310
00:57:52.231 --> 00:57:54.630
<v Speaker 1>they're feeling it and you're getting so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people's opinions,</v>

1311
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.473
<v Speaker 1>just you don't care for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to hear you don't </v>

1312
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.930
<v Speaker 1>appreciate or respect their intellect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their spouting out nonsense.</v>

1313
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a person who has to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1314
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:05.254
<v Speaker 1>it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read something that's saying </v>

1315
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Speaker 1>someone's saying really mean Shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Katy Perry and her hair,</v>

1316
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:10.444
<v Speaker 1>this fucking bitch thinks she's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate black culture and this and </v>

1317
00:58:12.861 --> 00:58:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you hoe.</v>

1318
00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.373
<v Speaker 1>And she starts reading that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panic that sets in thinking that </v>

1319
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:19.083
<v Speaker 1>poor Katy Perry this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bodyguards and fucking machine </v>

1320
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 1>guns looking out the windows and Katy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Perry's in her beverly hills mansion and</v>

1321
00:58:25.091 --> 00:58:26.650
<v Speaker 1>all these girls that I'll fucking cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1322
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:27.401
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1323
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:28.910
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna cut me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1324
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 1>She's like a little water balloon </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around her.</v>

1325
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Her Beverly Hills Mansion where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>soft soft body worried that.</v>

1326
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:39.023
<v Speaker 1>That's tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking bitch thinks she can take </v>

1327
00:58:40.781 --> 00:58:42.180
<v Speaker 1>our hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

1328
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.043
<v Speaker 1>As she said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said that she's worried about that </v>

1329
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:46.180
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1330
00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:51.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm just making the scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the drama.</v>

1331
00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

1332
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read almost.</v>

1333
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:58.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost all tweets like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's not that many actually </v>

1334
00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 1>in mentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1335
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:04.770
<v Speaker 1>So you read almost all the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to you.</v>

1336
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 1>You should never said that you've get </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up son.</v>

1337
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1338
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:09.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1339
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told people that before.</v>

1340
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not responding to all of them</v>

1341
00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and I might not get everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying in general,</v>

1342
00:59:18.281 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like I can,</v>

1343
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I can actually read through a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always interesting,</v>

1344
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:27.180
<v Speaker 1>like if someone brings up a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they'll,</v>

1345
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 1>they'll attack it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really hostile angle.</v>

1346
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Like at first they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1347
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1348
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:33.591
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1349
00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1350
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.791
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1351
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll be like,</v>

1352
00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:37.203
<v Speaker 1>so I'll either do two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll either answer it in an interesting </v>

1353
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:43.370
<v Speaker 1>way that kind of addresses their point </v>
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>

1354
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 1>or I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1355
00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 1>why do you feel this way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then talk about it and through a few</v>

1356
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:51.680
<v Speaker 1>exchanges and oftentimes at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it someone's like,</v>

1357
00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:52.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for taking the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's all I like.</v>

1361
00:59:57.321 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I like criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind criticism.</v>

1362
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be like if I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty show and someone was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1365
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that great and which I love,</v>

1366
01:00:08.781 --> 01:00:09.614
<v Speaker 1>I love like having that dialogue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just being like either open some things </v>

1367
01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1368
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 1>if it has a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1371
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll go for it.</v>

1372
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the ability to communicate with </v>

1373
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>people has its pros and cons for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1374
01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>It just does a lot of pros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to,</v>

1375
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you got to moderate yourself </v>

1376
01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:30.494
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to create some like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some filters and like understand like </v>

1377
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>how to just process something very </v>

<v Speaker 1>She certainly is a talented singer and </v>

<v Speaker 1>cultural relevance.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like how famous she is right now.</v>

1435
01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.523
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel for people that base their </v>

1436
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:05.050
<v Speaker 3>careers on that because there is a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can always transition for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>she made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was responsible for what she was </v>

1442

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1492
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:32.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1493
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.700
<v Speaker 3>what was the thing that happened with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart recently where he just got,</v>

1494
01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>he just got in in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just got in front of it,</v>

1495
01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:39.004
<v Speaker 3>like there was a woman that he ended up </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting together with one night in Las </v>

1496
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Vegas and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1497
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.024
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of a team,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of cat fished a little bit </v>

1498
01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they got a tape of him or something</v>

1499
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.040
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1500
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.650

<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1501
01:05:53.651 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 3>So this is how informed I am.</v>

1502
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 3>But I will say the point is they tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to extort him.</v>

1503
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 3>He just immediately this morning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>told everybody,</v>

1504
01:06:03.071 --> 01:06:03.611
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1505
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>

1506
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.150
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as he comes back to me,</v>

1507
01:06:07.151 --> 01:06:07.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it,</v>

1508
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:08.640
<v Speaker 3>makes feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1509
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally paraphrasing everything but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

1510
01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:12.613
<v Speaker 3>what for her it's like he didn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fascinating is it that there's </v>

1511
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:20.670
<v Speaker 3>people that would like to target him as </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an opportunity?</v>

1512
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Like he's sort of wholesome in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also a funny,</v>

1513
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1514
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:25.923
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1515
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:26.840
<v Speaker 3>What's so funny gaming,</v>

1516
01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:28.763
<v Speaker 4>they're going after MBA players and </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes and nfl players just like that </v>

1517
01:06:31.531 --> 01:06:32.364
<v Speaker 4>to targeting them and like looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>their instagram account now where </v>

1518
01:06:34.651 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be.</v>

1519
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:36.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just treat it as like a business </v>

1520
01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.390
<v Speaker 3>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like ransomware,</v>

1521
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's the human hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird time where time.</v>

1522
01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:47.540
<v Speaker 3>It is a weird time for stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1523
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:49.183
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird time for just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to enter the interaction that we </v>

1524
01:06:52.911 --> 01:06:54.590
<v Speaker 3>all have with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just very strange.</v>

1525
01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.230
<v Speaker 2>You just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all like the possibilities of where</v>

1526
01:06:57.231 --> 01:06:58.064
<v Speaker 2>this go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to seem like I kind of saw how </v>

1527
01:07:00.741 --> 01:07:01.574
<v Speaker 2>the world was going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I remember like being a kid and </v>

1528
01:07:03.531 --> 01:07:06.080
<v Speaker 2>being worried about the war with Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

1529
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember like always being </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried that felt good.</v>

1530
01:07:08.381 --> 01:07:10.790
<v Speaker 2>It was a good kind of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felt good.</v>

1531
01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:14.780
<v Speaker 2>It was an established logic now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once that sort of dissolved,</v>

1532
01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:15.883
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I kind of had a sense at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least in some rough form of what the </v>

1533
01:07:20.571 --> 01:07:22.940
<v Speaker 2>future was going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going to get better,</v>

1534
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.570
<v Speaker 2>people are going to get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is going to advance and then all of</v>

1535
01:07:26.571 --> 01:07:31.040
<v Speaker 2>a sudden the internet came along and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then any ideas that I had had about what</v>

1536
01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 2>the future was going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now like,</v>

1537
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fucking.</v>

1538
01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it kept getting more.</v>

1539
01:07:35.811 --> 01:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And more who knows,</v>

1540
01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.850
<v Speaker 2>who knows that I'm at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1541
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.830
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is this going?</v>

1542
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:44.743
<v Speaker 2>I really think it's going to some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality thing that people are </v>

1543
01:07:47.181 --> 01:07:49.280
<v Speaker 2>going to plug into and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than live.</v>

1544
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1545
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1546
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.280
<v Speaker 3>we're designing a better interface for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all the time,</v>

1547
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Speaker 3>but right now we're limited to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>little glowing rectangles.</v>

1548
01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:58.563
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the kids that are super into video </v>

1549
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:00.814
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're essentially experiencing it </v>

1550
01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:02.404
<v Speaker 3>right now just in a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like right in front of the </v>

1551
01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:07.420
<v Speaker 3>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like playing games.</v>

1552
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you do that all the time?</v>

1553
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

1554
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.770
<v Speaker 3>an issue for a few years with quake </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

1555
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just really fun.</v>

1556
01:08:16.581 --> 01:08:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Multiplayer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1557
01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:20.050
<v Speaker 3>I shy away from computer games now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

1558
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Too immersive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Man,</v>

1559
01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at.</v>

1560
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:27.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at not doing things I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

1561
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Well my thing is I like for me it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like short stories,</v>

1562
01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:34.240
<v Speaker 3>so like binge watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll,</v>

1563
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:39.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll choose the easiest setting and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>just play a game though where you're not</v>

1564
01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:41.080
<v Speaker 3>interacting with other people online.</v>

1565
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:41.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing by myself or co op that my </v>

1566
01:08:44.751 --> 01:08:46.610
<v Speaker 3>thing is like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think games.</v>

1567
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 3>This is something when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like where's it going?</v>

1568
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:49.693
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what will help and what I think </v>

1569
01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:52.994
<v Speaker 3>people really dig is I think people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get tired of this first person </v>

1570
01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:57.370
<v Speaker 3>shooters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's always like shooters.</v>

1571
01:08:57.371 --> 01:08:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot,</v>

1572
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.480
<v Speaker 3>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot,</v>

1573
01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.151
<v Speaker 3>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explode,</v>

1574
01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:02.270
<v Speaker 3>explode suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind necessarily doing that.</v>

1575
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I like it when it's more cartoony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm a fan of borderlands.</v>

1576
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like this cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a cel shaded.</v>

1577
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 3>It looks like you're playing a comic </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

1578
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:12.310
<v Speaker 3>puzzle solving and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1579
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 3>it's a first person shooter with lots of</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns,</v>

1580
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:15.194
<v Speaker 3>lots of explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything is like cartoony and mad </v>

1581
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:20.710
<v Speaker 3>maxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like crazy cartoony,</v>

1582
01:09:20.711 --> 01:09:23.170
<v Speaker 3>like just like comic book cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1583
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:24.143
<v Speaker 3>So there's like this cool joyfulness to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of video that I'd love to see </v>

1584
01:09:27.321 --> 01:09:27.890
<v Speaker 3>what that looks like.</v>

1585
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Tickets in borderlands two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a picture.</v>

1586
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Ads I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1587
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.633
<v Speaker 3>at the mall when you walk by the video </v>
<v Speaker 3>games it kind of looks like a Mad Max </v>

1588
01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always like some guy with a gun,</v>

1589
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:39.703
<v Speaker 3>he's got his fingers to his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's blowing his brains out and </v>

1590
01:09:41.331 --> 01:09:43.280
<v Speaker 3>then there's like some graphic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there you go.</v>

1591
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dudes wearing a gas mask.</v>

1592

<v Speaker 3>Cvs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the video yet.</v>

1593
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:49.063
<v Speaker 3>See what this looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really fun game and you can pull </v>

1594
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.940
<v Speaker 3>this sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1595
01:09:52.941 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1596
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.493
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1597
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing divinity to right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

1598
01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:00.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that this is dope.</v>

1599
01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.980
<v Speaker 3>This is what it looks like when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing it.</v>

1600
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:05.563
<v Speaker 3>Someone playing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is live at the top thing that </v>

1601
01:10:07.151 --> 01:10:09.080
<v Speaker 3>popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1602
01:10:09.081 --> 01:10:11.030
<v Speaker 3>so we're watching someone live on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitch,</v>

1603
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:11.864
<v Speaker 3>but what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it so compelling and it is </v>

1604
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:15.884
<v Speaker 3>compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why is it so compelling watching </v>

1605
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:18.170
<v Speaker 3>people play games?</v>

1606
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because,</v>

1607
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:21.561
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1608
01:10:21.561 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1609
01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's simulates real time action.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1611
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.150
<v Speaker 3>the first person point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's kind of exciting.</v>

1612
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever see Hardcore Henry?</v>

1613
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:35.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>heard it was awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's some of the best fight stunt work </v>

1616
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.013

<v Speaker 3>The choreography is insane and super </v>

1617
01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:46.440
<v Speaker 3>compelling.</v>

1618
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:49.250
<v Speaker 3>like if I take my seven year old to a </v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel like that like you're talking </v>

1621
01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:54.180
<v Speaker 3>about hardcore Henry.</v>

1623
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 3>But I'm able.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just staring at this by now.</v>

1624
01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is also a weird level.</v>

1625
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:02.240
<v Speaker 3>This is like some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like extra thing.</v>

1626
01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the game because the game </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks even more like deserty cartoony.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.043
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

1633
01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:19.584
<v Speaker 5>about this game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a new game that's gotten really </v>

<v Speaker 5>popular,</v>

1635
01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:23.450
<v Speaker 5>They're a player in nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>battle grounds,</v>

1636
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 5>popular using twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1637
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:28.050
<v Speaker 5>So this is a battle royale games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're like the hunger games if you've</v>

1638
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:32.580
<v Speaker 5>seen that for combat supply.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like what can you.</v>

1639
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:33.510
<v Speaker 5>Survival.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

1640
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:34.363
<v Speaker 5>what can you use?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can use a gun or you drop 100 </v>

1641
01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:39.180
<v Speaker 5>players drop into a map.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an island,</v>

1642
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.030
<v Speaker 5>it's about five square miles encroaches </v>
<v Speaker 5>overtime,</v>

1643
01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.273
<v Speaker 5>circled comes in and starts killing you </v>
<v Speaker 5>as you come in to have to find </v>

1644
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:50.790
<v Speaker 5>solicitor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's moving all of the guns and anything</v>

1645
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:51.624
<v Speaker 5>you find in the map,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it randomly placed around the map so </v>

1646
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 5>you're starting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone starts this scratch with just a</v>

1647
01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:59.670
<v Speaker 5>fist and your goal is to survive or play</v>
<v Speaker 5>hide and seek.</v>

1648
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:03.930
<v Speaker 5>So either you become the bad ass that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kills everyone or jacked or are you just</v>

1649
01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:04.764
<v Speaker 5>hide and just survive to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile people are watching this </v>

1650
01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:10.080
<v Speaker 5>on twitch also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a popular thing to watch on</v>

1651
01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:10.914
<v Speaker 5>there too.</v>

1652
01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.620
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense though because like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing all these.</v>

1653
01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching a gladiator match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1654
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:17.040
<v Speaker 3>but hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're watching on</v>

1655
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:17.963
<v Speaker 5>which can someone have a chat in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other screen where the person is </v>

1656
01:12:20.371 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 5>playing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can read the chat where people are.</v>

1657
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:26.340
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing that recently and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can talk to me while I'm playing.</v>

1658
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:27.203
<v Speaker 5>They get a tip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I'll miss something like I'll </v>

1659
01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.000
<v Speaker 5>just skip a scope and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1660
01:12:30.001 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 5>you missed the scope or you missed that </v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome gun.</v>

1661
01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:33.810
<v Speaker 5>Go back and get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my question is,</v>

1662
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:34.644
<v Speaker 5>is it possible for them to also be </v>
<v Speaker 5>monitoring the other people in the game </v>

1663
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 5>and tell you where those people are?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

1664
01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:40.374
<v Speaker 5>That's called stream sniping and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>a cheating thing that's being handled </v>

1665
01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's this being handled?</v>

1666
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:45.834
<v Speaker 5>You can delay your stream a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can hide different things that give </v>

1667
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:51.780
<v Speaker 5>away your location on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's a setting that you can have.</v>

1668
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:52.614
<v Speaker 5>Can you have a problem with people being</v>
<v Speaker 5>able to chat with each other a little </v>

1669
01:12:57.361 --> 01:12:58.194
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like mighty mouse is actually doing </v>

1670
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:01.500
<v Speaker 5>this too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he did a custom game with all of his</v>

1671
01:13:01.501 --> 01:13:04.290
<v Speaker 5>fans and 100 people that were just </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching him.</v>

1672
01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:08.450
<v Speaker 5>I jumped into we're all playing and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you'll just.</v>

1673
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.293
<v Speaker 5>People end up going to attack them </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they wouldn't be the guy that </v>

1674
01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:13.230
<v Speaker 5>killed mighty mouse in the game or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is.</v>

1675
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:14.064
<v Speaker 5>But like</v>

1676
01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I want to be the one to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1677
01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:18.920
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1678
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.540
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like co op games so I like fighting ai</v>

1679
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:24.930
<v Speaker 3>with other humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>coming because what I discovered when I </v>

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.113
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hugely popular game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was playing it and it's one of </v>

1692
01:13:49.611 --> 01:13:54.611
<v Speaker 3>those like massive multiplayer games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like every time it starts,</v>

1693
01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:57.890
<v Speaker 3>like there's all these people running </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and you don't know anybody.</v>

1694
01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.160

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard they're there.</v>

1733
01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't,</v>

1734
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 3>wasn't there a place that was doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality in Utah?</v>

1735
01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't like in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1736
01:15:32.911 --> 01:15:34.290
<v Speaker 3>you think it's Salt Lake City?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Toy?</v>

1737
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:35.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're setting up a whole like </v>

1738
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:38.200
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1739
01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:39.810
<v Speaker 3>they have one set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1740
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:40.683
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did the ghostbusters thing at </v>

1741
01:15:41.861 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Madame tussauds wax museum in New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the ghostbusters.</v>

1742
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:47.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.990
<v Speaker 3>The future of virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's magazine.</v>

1744
01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:50.853
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you wear a backpack is a backpack </v>

1745
01:15:52.241 --> 01:15:53.074
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your wireless and then they have </v>

1746
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:57.250
<v Speaker 3>custom goggles that they fit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at this shit and,</v>

1747
01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.190
<v Speaker 3>and all of this is mapped in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1748
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.400
<v Speaker 3>So you're holding the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look down,</v>

1749
01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 3>you see the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gun moves when you move it.</v>

1750
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 3>So these people are walking through </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentencing environment.</v>

1751
01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 3>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:12.130
<v Speaker 3>So that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's mapped.</v>

1753
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:15.760
<v Speaker 3>So this is what you're seeing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain and so certain things,</v>

1754
01:16:15.761 --> 01:16:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how one to one.</v>

1755
01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that in the future with real time</v>

1756
01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.280
<v Speaker 3>data capture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with cloud capture,</v>

1757
01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:25.503
<v Speaker 3>you'll be able to pick up objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it'll actually be able to track of </v>

1758
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.960
<v Speaker 3>teddy bear and you reach out and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>teddy bears there.</v>

1759
01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 3>It's lined up well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can naturalists grab it,</v>

1760
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 3>you squeeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in real time,</v>

1761
01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:37.740
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1762
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.863
<v Speaker 3>the system is reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's actually puppeting all the </v>

1763
01:16:41.381 --> 01:16:43.600
<v Speaker 3>objects in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1764
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:45.940
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the floor rumbles,</v>

1765
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.120
<v Speaker 3>their steam that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1766
01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.860
<v Speaker 3>kind of like a wide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you are the visual component year to</v>

1767
01:16:51.861 --> 01:16:54.120
<v Speaker 3>hijack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right now is just ghostbusters.</v>

1768
01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ghostbusters and the void?</v>

1769
01:16:56.650 --> 01:16:59.170
<v Speaker 3>The void is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's public.</v>

1770
01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can go there.</v>

1771
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.781
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1772
01:17:01.781 --> 01:17:02.614
<v Speaker 3>So the void,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a place that's opening up </v>

1773
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.090
<v Speaker 3>hopefully in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Los Angeles,</v>

1774
01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:08.590
<v Speaker 3>which is totally right for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1775
01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:11.210
<v Speaker 3>There's a huge community here that Santa</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monica.</v>

1776
01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1777
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:15.110
<v Speaker 3>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least like five major players,</v>

1779
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in like Santa Monica area,</v>

1780
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.053
<v Speaker 3>major players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by major player people </v>

1781
01:17:21.741 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 3>as humans are the time players like </v>
<v Speaker 3>weaver?</v>

1782
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1783
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.690
<v Speaker 3>they have stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1784
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have titles that they're working on</v>

1785
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.480
<v Speaker 3>and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have experiences,</v>

1786
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what some people call simulations </v>

1787
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactive experiences,</v>

1788
01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just like puzzles or whatever.</v>

1789
01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People innovating for Vr.</v>

1790
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.094
<v Speaker 3>So their company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their production companies that make </v>

1791
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:47.150
<v Speaker 3>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think in code,</v>

1792
01:17:47.151 --> 01:17:48.830
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they code,</v>

1793
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:52.550
<v Speaker 3>they create software or they're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at capturing.</v>

1794
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:53.383
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1795
01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Adi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which does like spherical capture,</v>

1796
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or uh,</v>

1797
01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.330
<v Speaker 3>or volumetric capture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called.</v>

1798
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot,</v>

1799
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.653
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the technology is here and it's </v>

1800
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:05.684
<v Speaker 3>always being innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but warehouse scale is the perfect </v>

1801
01:18:08.031 --> 01:18:08.864
<v Speaker 3>marriage for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in La who liked to be active </v>

1802
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:16.370
<v Speaker 3>and might feel weird about sitting down </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a chair and just staring at a screen,</v>

1803
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:17.303
<v Speaker 3>the controller in their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can understand naturalistic </v>

1804
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:19.994
<v Speaker 3>movement and you can in warehouse scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can actually see the size of the </v>

1805
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:24.194
<v Speaker 3>room and feel the breadth of the space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that particular video it seemed </v>

1806
01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:32.000
<v Speaker 3>like they had chairs and tables and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything like that,</v>

1807
01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 3>but the actual textures on those chip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was all added later.</v>

1808
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the objects were real.</v>

1809
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they look some of the projects,</v>

1810
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:42.980
<v Speaker 3>some of the objects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the major obstacles are there.</v>

1811
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The table share was crazy because they </v>

1812
01:18:45.591 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 3>have a chair in the video game that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed to me to be very different.</v>

1813
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Like the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

1814
01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1815
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not one to one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1816
01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:57.410
<v Speaker 3>it's just a basic representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but saying in the future you'll actually</v>

1817
01:18:57.411 --> 01:19:01.550
<v Speaker 3>be able to just have like a movie set </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the system will be able to.</v>

1818
01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.640
<v Speaker 3>We will already have a preloaded pre </v>
<v Speaker 3>scanned sized version of that room,</v>

1819
01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:07.784
<v Speaker 3>but then there'll be sensors that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>real time calibrating it to make sure </v>

1820
01:19:10.071 --> 01:19:12.410
<v Speaker 3>that it's rock solid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you reach out you're like,</v>

1821
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:13.603
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I had to move my hand </v>

1822
01:19:14.361 --> 01:19:15.194
<v Speaker 3>a little higher to grab this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just reach out and it's right </v>

1823
01:19:16.851 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 3>there and it's a one for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

1824
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that the chair is very low </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ground?</v>

1825
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:22.243
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at these people walking through </v>

1826
01:19:22.851 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas this,</v>

1827
01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 3>if they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1828
01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:28.970
<v Speaker 3>this was called Vr studio vr arcade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This might've been a.</v>

1829
01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ferk iteration and yeah,</v>

1830
01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:34.610
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking insane in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1831
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:37.040
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird.</v>

1832
01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be so weird.</v>

1833
01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.093
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine like if the mapping becomes so </v>

1834
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:46.130
<v Speaker 3>like rock solid that you could reliably </v>
<v Speaker 3>run up a flight of stairs.</v>

1835
01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so crazy.</v>

1836
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean that sounds like sounds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like it's not.</v>

1837
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:55.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once it comes becomes wireless.</v>

1838
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:57.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean remember when the only way to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>internet,</v>

1839
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:58.723
<v Speaker 3>the only way to get to the Internet was </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have an Ethernet cable connected to </v>

1840
01:20:00.741 --> 01:20:01.760
<v Speaker 3>your device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1841
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:04.130
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have anything to cable anywhere.</v>

1842
01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where to get one.</v>

1843
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:05.880
<v Speaker 3>The only.</v>

1844
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.713
<v Speaker 3>The only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only problem with Vr is that the </v>

1845
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:10.740
<v Speaker 3>processing power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for awhile it had to be tethered to a</v>

1846
01:20:10.741 --> 01:20:13.140
<v Speaker 3>PC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they have pc backpacks.</v>

1847
01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Well now I guarantee you what they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have is a like one of those,</v>

1848
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get one of those five charge battery</v>

1849
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:20.094
<v Speaker 3>packs for a phone where you can recharge</v>
<v Speaker 3>your totally going to get one of those </v>

1850
01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:23.694
<v Speaker 3>bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to hook up to your phone and </v>

1851
01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:26.054
<v Speaker 3>everything is going to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the processing is going to be on </v>

1852
01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a bluetooth headset</v>

1853
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to be able to go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a park and do this.</v>

1854
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 3>It'll be like Bluetooth five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 point.</v>

1855
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you and your friends.</v>

1856
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 3>You'll just have to walk across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>park.</v>

1857
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 3>Like you remember when you first got an </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone and you had to do the fingerprint</v>

1858
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:44.484
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of times.</v>

1859
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I can also do sorts of different ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>the side of the front and the back.</v>

1860
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what you'll have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1861
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:49.914
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>define your parameters are out in the </v>

1862
01:20:51.241 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 3>park and everybody will walk to the park</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and criss cross.</v>

1863
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:56.400
<v Speaker 3>And then once the computer has enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>data,</v>

1864
01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:57.234
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1865
01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:02.390
<v Speaker 3>processing the game begins in 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then your Avatar just transforms.</v>

1866
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1867
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:06.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1868
01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.141
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1869
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:07.974
<v Speaker 3>you have augmented reality and virtual </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and augmented reality is </v>

1870
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:13.420
<v Speaker 3>interesting with Microsoft's Hololens </v>
<v Speaker 3>uses this real time.</v>

1871
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:16.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically can see the environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>around it,</v>

1872
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:21.290
<v Speaker 3>wrapping it so it stereoscopically maps </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it creates a really quick texture</v>

1873
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:26.601
<v Speaker 3>map of the environment that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that mixed with like the idea</v>

1874
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.150
<v Speaker 3>behind the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the name of the project,</v>

1875
01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.520
<v Speaker 3>but it was a early Microsoft project </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it took,</v>

1876
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:37.080
<v Speaker 3>it's basically scraped all relevant </v>
<v Speaker 3>types of photos and stitch them together</v>

1877
01:21:37.081 --> 01:21:37.914
<v Speaker 3>and created a virtual three d </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments of locations based on </v>

1878
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:45.000
<v Speaker 3>photographs that are everywhere on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet so it could recreate a plaza in</v>

1879
01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:45.834
<v Speaker 3>Italy.</v>

1880
01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:46.803
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then using like kind of </v>

1881
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:48.774
<v Speaker 3>interpolation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the AI software kind of stitching </v>

1882
01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:51.391
<v Speaker 3>it together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1883
01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:52.224
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that existing already just </v>

1884
01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:56.790
<v Speaker 3>because people are passing by with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones.</v>

1885
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:58.540
<v Speaker 3>They're taking pictures or taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

1886
01:21:58.541 --> 01:21:59.374
<v Speaker 3>So all of that data is now president </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to the location that you're </v>

1887
01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:02.994
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mixed with headsets that are able to </v>

1888
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 3>scan in real time collectively that also</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets processed and stitch together,</v>

1889
01:22:09.241 --> 01:22:14.100
<v Speaker 3>cross together so that instantaneously </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have a mapped almost one for one</v>

1890
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 3>game zone and a giant park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like pretty quick.</v>

1891
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.353
<v Speaker 3>And just like how you described it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like using things that are in the </v>

1892
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:22.704
<v Speaker 3>headset that are tracking in real time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then transmitting it or at that are </v>

1893
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:26.783
<v Speaker 3>completely internal to the headset and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then also networked intelligence to </v>

1894
01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:29.994
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also probably some fake stuff </v>

1895
01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:34.560
<v Speaker 3>that they can create visually.</v>

1896
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:38.440
<v Speaker 3>And with three d sound totally see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1897
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:41.200
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing an Avatar game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the dragons flying overhead,</v>

1898
01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:44.040
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the Hololens does that.</v>

1899
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.010
<v Speaker 3>It's got these two little slits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even like regular speakers.</v>

1900
01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Their slips that are above your ears </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are pointed down.</v>

1901
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:51.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like a almost like hypersonic </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound,</v>

1902
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sound.</v>

1903
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:52.914
<v Speaker 3>That can be basically paper thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I move the access you can't hear </v>

1904
01:22:55.951 --> 01:22:58.170
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if I move it back on access and</v>

1905
01:22:58.171 --> 01:22:59.004
<v Speaker 3>you haven't moved your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hear it specifically in one tiny </v>

1906
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 3>slice of audio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it has to be very precise.</v>

1907
01:23:06.491 --> 01:23:07.324
<v Speaker 3>So it's a form of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just pointing down and they </v>

1908
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:10.204
<v Speaker 3>can simulate dolby five point one by </v>
<v Speaker 3>normally just saying think about house </v>

1909
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.280
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your,</v>

1910
01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:18.340
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your earplugs are right.</v>

1911
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like look at this little tiny ass </v>

1912
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:20.690
<v Speaker 3>speaker.</v>

1913
01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:21.523
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's little tiny ass speaker when </v>

1914
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:25.870
<v Speaker 3>it's in your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can get too loud.</v>

1915
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:27.303
<v Speaker 3>Like if I listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I listen to music sometimes it can </v>

1916
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:30.424
<v Speaker 3>get too loud with these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I got to get you better had </v>

1917
01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are great.</v>

1918
01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.210
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're good.</v>

1919
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:35.103
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones that come with the </v>

1920
01:23:36.841 --> 01:23:37.860
<v Speaker 3>iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:38.890
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're okay.</v>

1922
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of high end which is not</v>

1923
01:23:41.411 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 3>good for your hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1924
01:23:42.761 --> 01:23:45.370
<v Speaker 3>not good for your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like things that are soft on my ears,</v>

1925
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 3>but I can hear clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about what?</v>

1926
01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Precision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this fuck this?</v>

1927
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:51.200
<v Speaker 3>Fuck your ears up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say like.</v>

1928
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:52.303
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1929
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:55.370
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what you're using for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ear pods.</v>

1930
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.760
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] actually sounded really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking great.</v>

1931
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I like the ear pods are better.</v>

1932
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 3>I like them better than the headphones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that come standard.</v>

1933
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Anytime headphones are included,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1934
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:05.500
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're okay,</v>

1935
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.393
<v Speaker 3>but they're not great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean on an apple standard better than </v>

1936
01:24:09.221 --> 01:24:10.670
<v Speaker 3>most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1937
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:14.350
<v Speaker 3>the earpods or more precise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earpods just sound natural.</v>

1938
01:24:14.351 --> 01:24:18.490
<v Speaker 3>They'd sound like I'm really surprised </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm prepared for them not to sound good.</v>

1939
01:24:18.491 --> 01:24:19.324
<v Speaker 3>Almost every time they use them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they sound great because they're </v>

1940
01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:23.920
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't seal the ear,</v>

1941
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.370
<v Speaker 3>they sit in the ear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the design is so ingenious that even</v>

1942
01:24:27.371 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 3>when I'm working out I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like on the bench,</v>

1943
01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 3>getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping around.</v>

1944
01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 3>They're still not falling out and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound great.</v>

1945
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:37.180
<v Speaker 3>The bass sounds all natural and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it in like a high end pair.</v>

1946
01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:38.014
<v Speaker 3>I have like a crazy amount of headphones</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll put in some like crazy </v>

1947
01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 3>headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some odd days,</v>

1948
01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:48.280
<v Speaker 3>whatever plan or magnetic blah bullshits</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little tiny ones that don't require</v>

1949
01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:51.940
<v Speaker 3>much power of phone would power it fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I put those in and I'm like,</v>

1950
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds really small.</v>

1951
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I have to adjust to its detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the IPODS,</v>

1952
01:24:57.671 --> 01:24:58.960
<v Speaker 3>like as soon as I put them in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1953
01:24:58.961 --> 01:24:59.794
<v Speaker 3>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like a nice perfect frequency </v>

1954
01:25:01.211 --> 01:25:03.220
<v Speaker 3>curve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feels very flat in real.</v>

1955
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a strong endorsement.</v>

1956
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:07.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really.</v>

1958
01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very impressed with them.</v>

1959
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.500
<v Speaker 3>I bought them and I never opened the </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

1960
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.573
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're easy to pair man and it's cool </v>

1961
01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:16.630
<v Speaker 3>because I just had them in my jeans all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1962
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1963
01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.190
<v Speaker 3>A little easier to handle in this wire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wire gets fucked up.</v>

1964
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just like,</v>

1965
01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I just pulled it out and it's so fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the way it snaps closed and open</v>

1966
01:25:26.051 --> 01:25:27.430
<v Speaker 3>magnetically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So satisfying.</v>

1967
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 3>How long is the battery?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life lasts a little suckers.</v>

1968
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I think it's eight hours real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with the case.</v>

1969
01:25:32.411 --> 01:25:36.360
<v Speaker 3>The charge case recharges right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether their parents,</v>

1970
01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:37.203
<v Speaker 3>the Apple Watch.</v>

1973
01:25:44.651 --> 01:25:45.550
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's better?</v>

1974
01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Lte now you can leave your phone at </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

1975

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just take your watch.</v>

1976
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comfortable enough with your life to do </v>

1977
01:25:50.831 --> 01:25:51.664
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I'm going to a concert or </v>

1978
01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

1979
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1980
01:25:57.251 --> 01:26:00.730
<v Speaker 3>I think what's great about this and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw people talking about like,</v>

1981
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.150
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about the Apple Watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they first announced it,</v>

1982
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:05.630
<v Speaker 3>there was so many people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so stupid.</v>

1983
01:26:05.631 --> 01:26:07.810
<v Speaker 3>You already have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need a,</v>

1984
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does your watch needs to be a phone?</v>

1985
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.200
<v Speaker 3>And they're saying all these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>related to that.</v>

1986
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:12.861
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1987
01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:13.694
<v Speaker 3>you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about having to not manage a </v>

1988
01:26:17.301 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 3>physical object.</v>

1989
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:23.090
<v Speaker 3>It's the watch is on your wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just stays on your wrist the whole,</v>

1990
01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:23.973
<v Speaker 3>the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean unless you take it off or </v>

1991
01:26:24.831 --> 01:26:25.664
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time you just leave it </v>

1992
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 3>on the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's always there.</v>

1993
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.940
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to make a call,</v>

1994
01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:33.410
<v Speaker 3>you make a call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to take call,</v>

1995
01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:34.490
<v Speaker 3>you know you have your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pods,</v>

1996
01:26:34.491 --> 01:26:37.880
<v Speaker 3>you can do a phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can listen to your music on it.</v>

1997
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:40.470
<v Speaker 3>How much power battery wise is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing have?</v>

1998
01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I think on Lte,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

1999
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Like six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five hours,</v>

2000
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.360
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you live in a half a day.</v>

2001
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.560
<v Speaker 3>You get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that thing works better.</v>

2002
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like all lte bit.</v>

2003
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:56.450
<v Speaker 3>But realistically you're not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>on lte all the time,</v>

2004
01:26:56.451 --> 01:26:59.420
<v Speaker 3>so depending on your usage it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

2005
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:00.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it'll last.</v>

2006
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean is that five hours of talking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of yet lte,</v>

2007
01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:08.590
<v Speaker 3>like talking or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think for me I'm like around 67,</v>

2008
01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.020
<v Speaker 3>74 percent every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really at the end of every day.</v>

2009
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:14.420
<v Speaker 3>So I can go a couple days without </v>
<v Speaker 3>charging it actually.</v>

2010
01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

2011
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.350
<v Speaker 3>Move though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I liked it.</v>

2012
01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Feel like a rebel,</v>

2013
01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:19.963
<v Speaker 3>like pushing it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no wireless pads are going to be </v>

2014
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:23.174
<v Speaker 3>everywhere soon enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're using it on my phone or the watch </v>

2015
01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:27.554
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got the eight plus and just set </v>

2016
01:27:29.841 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 3>it right on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to get the 10 as well.</v>

2017
01:27:31.701 --> 01:27:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Are you a hedonist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy person.</v>

2018

<v Speaker 3>I have like almost every top phone </v>

2024
01:27:47.871 --> 01:27:50.230

<v Speaker 3>because they're too,</v>

2025
01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.450
<v Speaker 3>they're too divergent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're very similar.</v>

2026
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.470
<v Speaker 3>I like to check out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>doesn't do that.</v>

2029
01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.570
<v Speaker 3>That's frustrating that this doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2030
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:00.550
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2031
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:04.580
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for airdrop airdrops kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of keeping me on board,</v>

2032
01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 3>like I realized how much I liked that </v>
<v Speaker 3>once I tried the Google Pixel,</v>

2033
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 3>which I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2034
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:10.274
<v Speaker 3>that's a great fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great phone and the Pixel two supposed </v>

2035
01:28:12.331 --> 01:28:13.320
<v Speaker 3>to be even better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2036
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 3>the Samsung Galaxy note eight might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best phone in the world.</v>

2037
01:28:16.821 --> 01:28:17.511
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2038
01:28:17.511 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>I have the eight of the eight plus it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very beautiful note plus as a.</v>

2039
01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.291
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2040
01:28:23.291 --> 01:28:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2041
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:25.760
<v Speaker 3>galaxy eight plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 3>But the note is a similar same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's got the obviously the style and</v>

2043
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple other features.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the cameras the same,</v>

2044
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:38.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's just got a couple extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>features.</v>

2045
01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 3>So I just stick with the smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about it?</v>

2046
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Plus the eight plus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2047
01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The screen is gorgeous.</v>

2048
01:28:43.941 --> 01:28:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2049
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.010
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

2050
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.930
<v Speaker 3>The colors are just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really beautiful.</v>

2051
01:28:48.931 --> 01:28:51.050
<v Speaker 3>And once you have no bevel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2052
01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:52.530
<v Speaker 3>You look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Is it basil?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basil.</v>

2054
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:54.853
<v Speaker 3>Why don't say bevel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might've said something you grew </v>

2055
01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.310
<v Speaker 3>because it's soft enough of a v.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2056
01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 3>he said Bezel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just sounded weird through.</v>

2057
01:29:01.411 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 3>I call myself</v>

2058
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 1>out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good job man.</v>

2059
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 1>But that he did so much more beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>than seeing that edge.</v>

2060
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:07.884
<v Speaker 1>That edge is like the obvious edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the iphone where your </v>

2061
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:10.644
<v Speaker 1>fingerprint scanner goes and the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the iphone where the speaker is the </v>

2062
01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:14.580
<v Speaker 1>chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks clunky.</v>

2063
01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally clunky and it's,</v>

2064
01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2065
01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:18.483
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the next step before a augmented </v>

2066
01:29:21.751 --> 01:29:25.380
<v Speaker 1>reality glasses so that your phones or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone or your glasses.</v>

2067
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 1>When I look at the note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight red band as the note eight,</v>

2068
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.390
<v Speaker 1>it looks like minority report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at this.</v>

2069
01:29:30.391 --> 01:29:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2070
01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole screen.</v>

2071
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're holding the screen.</v>

2072
01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's all screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the future.</v>

2073
01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2074
01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 1>It legitimately feels to me like a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>step up from like a regular phone.</v>

2075
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I look at that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2076
01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:43.910
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2077
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2078
01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:47.004
<v Speaker 1>I got the essential phone too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to see what that display was like </v>

2079
01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:51.630
<v Speaker 1>to kind of get a preview for the iphone </v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

2080
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Iphone 10 is going to be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to blow it all.</v>

2081
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks great.</v>

2082
01:29:56.601 --> 01:29:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean I will say that their product </v>
<v Speaker 1>design has been like,</v>

2083
01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.180
<v Speaker 1>there was a period where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2084
01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:01.403
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of like their last few </v>

2085
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:04.240
<v Speaker 1>iterations of computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2086
01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.093
<v Speaker 1>I always get the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the new everything from apple </v>

2087
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:07.343
<v Speaker 1>pretty much and then just either sell or</v>
<v Speaker 1>like find like someone who needs a </v>

2088
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 1>computer or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just give it to them.</v>

2089
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.240
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I cycled through a lot of technology.</v>

2090
01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just for awhile they know the,</v>

2091
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 1>the laptops were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were cool,</v>

2092
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:22.680
<v Speaker 1>they were like some nice improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I like the,</v>

2093
01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the macbook pro design is pretty cool.</v>

2094
01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I like the Strip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was going to be a gimmick.</v>

2095
01:30:27.361 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 1>The strip becomes an issue with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have fat fingers and sometimes</v>

2096
01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2097
01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just stable secrets for,</v>

2098
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the laptop now.</v>

2099
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:37.344
<v Speaker 1>But I did too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't matter when you hit the </v>

2100
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:43.731
<v Speaker 1>button and release a series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm talking about.</v>

2101
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>

2102
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right there.</v>

2103
01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:52.080
<v Speaker 1>It's right there where the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>delete key.</v>

2104
01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:54.980
<v Speaker 1>His finger slips and goes up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2105
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It falls in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2106
01:30:56.671 --> 01:31:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to enable Siri know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bench seats cancel?</v>

2107
01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just learn.</v>

2108
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:03.443
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just I didn't want me to technology to </v>

2109
01:31:04.741 --> 01:31:06.720
<v Speaker 1>learn better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not learning very well.</v>

2110
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:08.003
<v Speaker 1>The thing about being able to switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows on the bar is kind of </v>

2111
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:10.914
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but quite honestly I never used it </v>

2112
01:31:12.151 --> 01:31:12.480
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2113
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.313
<v Speaker 1>Never used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer mechanical buttons for </v>

2114
01:31:14.941 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 1>sound too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

2115
01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I it's way faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way faster.</v>

2116
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:21.263
<v Speaker 1>You have to press it once and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to press it again and then just </v>

2117
01:31:23.521 --> 01:31:25.120
<v Speaker 1>said just the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't have it?</v>

2118
01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:25.973
<v Speaker 1>Just a process of mine is like normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's probably a keyboard </v>

2119
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.290
<v Speaker 1>combine you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's our command,</v>

2120
01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:32.124
<v Speaker 1>apple or plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only other complaint that I would </v>

2121
01:31:33.841 --> 01:31:34.674
<v Speaker 1>have is I really like a tactile </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical feeling keyboard when I </v>

2122
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:39.340
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2123
01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>particular bigger keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bigger key.</v>

2124
01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:43.980
<v Speaker 1>A throw traveling like this one because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2125
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:45.043
<v Speaker 1>I liked this new Mac book pro better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the last Mac book pro because the </v>

2126
01:31:48.051 --> 01:31:51.590
<v Speaker 1>last one was kind of mushy a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this one is more like it.</v>

2127
01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It seems like real positive feedback </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it clicks and what I really like is</v>

2128
01:31:56.191 --> 01:32:00.610
<v Speaker 1>the Lenovo thinkpads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they amazing keyboard</v>

2129
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 3>that works like you feel where the keys </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2130
01:32:03.911 --> 01:32:07.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like I type faster with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just feels like more surgery.</v>

2131
01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:08.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fingers just can communicate with it </v>

2132
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:10.781
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2133
01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:13.530
<v Speaker 3>These are like flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like flat rectangle.</v>

2134
01:32:13.531 --> 01:32:15.230
<v Speaker 3>They're not very high off the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>

2135
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:18.370
<v Speaker 3>so because of the fact they're not very </v>
<v Speaker 3>high off of the rest of the keyboard.</v>

2136
01:32:18.371 --> 01:32:19.204
<v Speaker 3>You're not sure what you're touching </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes socially if you have calluses </v>

2137
01:32:22.031 --> 01:32:23.910
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fingers.</v>

2138
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:24.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to just understand the </v>

2139
01:32:26.321 --> 01:32:27.154
<v Speaker 3>spacing of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost like they're preparing </v>

2140
01:32:29.111 --> 01:32:33.570
<v Speaker 3>you for typing on a glass screen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way you type on your iphone and and</v>

2141
01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.900
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of that.</v>

2142
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I think we should be able to speak to </v>
<v Speaker 3>our computers and they go,</v>

2143
01:32:38.251 --> 01:32:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just get a keyboard.</v>

2144
01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you touch to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2145
01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that.</v>

2146
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:43.253
<v Speaker 3>I wanted this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the whole thing for a laptop in </v>

2147
01:32:44.861 --> 01:32:47.260
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally sent me a screen and a keyboard.</v>

2148
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:48.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

2149
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I though,</v>

2150
01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.393
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have an echo or any of those </v>

2151
01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:52.181
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I got an echo of never set it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't use it,</v>

2153
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 3>so gave it to me as a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

2154
01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:00.610
<v Speaker 3>but just sitting there and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally get that.</v>

2155
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 3>But I will say I use it for my lights in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my house is really nice.</v>

2156
01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.393
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as I'm going to bed I'll just fit </v>

<v Speaker 3>Can you say shut the lights off bitch?</v>

2159

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2160
01:33:13.601 --> 01:33:15.100
<v Speaker 3>See it needs to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2161
01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 3>I need to be able to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to get there.</v>

2162
01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming.</v>

2163
01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:20.460
<v Speaker 3>These lights and then you can set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>

2164
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:21.363
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying like you can speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it super fast so I can say like I'm </v>

2165
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:25.930
<v Speaker 3>in the living room and I want the lights</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll just say computer a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn the living room lights off and just</v>

2167
01:33:30.101 --> 01:33:33.130
<v Speaker 3>walk away and he gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like immediately on,</v>

2168
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:34.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2169
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:35.770
<v Speaker 3>it hears that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that prompt.</v>

2170
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:36.963
<v Speaker 3>It's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying the sentence </v>

2171
01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:39.400
<v Speaker 3>naturalistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying,</v>

2172
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Siri.</v>

2173
01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:41.523
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2174
01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:47.340
<v Speaker 3>How many times have I gone to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bathroom today?</v>

2175
01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.073
<v Speaker 6>Did it?</v>

2176
01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.280
<v Speaker 3>You've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

2177
01:33:52.281 --> 01:33:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that long.</v>

2178
01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:58.120
<v Speaker 3>It's that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would I buy the I?</v>

2179
01:33:58.130 --> 01:33:58.963
<v Speaker 3>There's just no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason for me to use </v>

2180
01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:03.020
<v Speaker 3>something that takes that fucking long </v>
<v Speaker 3>to process.</v>

2181
01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.670
<v Speaker 3>It's faster to do voice dictation in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a google APP,</v>

2182
01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you're gonna get.</v>

2183
01:34:09.021 --> 01:34:10.190
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a combo.</v>

2184
01:34:10.191 --> 01:34:13.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like the voice did better in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Google apps.</v>

2185
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is better.</v>

2186
01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.173
<v Speaker 3>It said their algorithms are better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the artificial intelligence is a </v>

2187
01:34:18.701 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 3>little bit better note keeping and stuff</v>

<v Speaker 3>assistant than you can with Siri also.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't want to like get it.</v>

2194
01:34:36.710 --> 01:34:38.270
<v Speaker 3>I like Cortana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's great.</v>

2195
01:34:38.271 --> 01:34:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I love Halo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

2196
01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to be a computer and I want to</v>

2197
01:34:43.251 --> 01:34:45.770
<v Speaker 3>just do what I'd like it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to hear like,</v>

2199
01:34:47.271 --> 01:34:48.104

2201
01:34:52.851 --> 01:34:53.684

<v Speaker 3>dig and just kind of do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:02.684
<v Speaker 3>there should be an option for whether or</v>
<v Speaker 3>not you want it to behave like a corny </v>

<v Speaker 5>That's what I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have 40 minutes of your audio,</v>

2236
01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.880
<v Speaker 5>they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They basically have you</v>

2237
01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.060
<v Speaker 3>demo stuff I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does Donald Trump's voice here?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

2240
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Love Him.</v>

2241
01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:30.900
<v Speaker 7>H is considering in addition to other </v>
<v Speaker 7>options,</v>

2242
01:36:30.901 --> 01:36:34.020
<v Speaker 7>stopping all trade with any country </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing business with North Korea.</v>

2243
01:36:34.690 --> 01:36:36.180
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>

2244
01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:37.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know,</v>

2245
01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.780
<v Speaker 3>you know that it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell it's synthesized,</v>

2246
01:36:39.810 --> 01:36:42.600
<v Speaker 3>but you know that attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds amazing though.</v>

2247
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.753
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty great</v>

2248
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.033
<v Speaker 7>meeting General Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>General Maddis and other military </v>

2249
01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:50.540
<v Speaker 7>leaders at the White House to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 7>North Korea,</v>

2250
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:53.320
<v Speaker 3>but the middle section was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The front of the</v>

2251
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:54.560
<v Speaker 5>backward not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2252
01:36:54.561 --> 01:36:57.350
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they're adding that </v>
<v Speaker 5>reverberation.</v>

2253
01:36:57.351 --> 01:36:59.990
<v Speaker 5>That weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it thinks that's part of the audio,</v>

2254
01:36:59.991 --> 01:37:00.824
<v Speaker 5>like the quality of the water from </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing that on purpose because </v>

2255
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.823
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about the president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like can you do an audio version of the </v>

2256
01:37:06.471 --> 01:37:07.304
<v Speaker 5>president and pretend like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you might get in real trouble </v>

2257
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:10.363
<v Speaker 5>because that audio could be used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if he never actually said that </v>

2258
01:37:12.231 --> 01:37:14.240
<v Speaker 5>about not doing business with North </v>
<v Speaker 5>Korea.</v>

2259
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:16.640
<v Speaker 5>If they didn't make an obviously fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>version.</v>

2260
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.230
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty fun.</v>

2261
01:37:18.231 --> 01:37:19.340
<v Speaker 5>Another language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another person.</v>

2262
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:20.850
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna.</v>

2263
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Run to the restroom real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2264
01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:25.340
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go play me some Broccoli.</v>

2265
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:28.850
<v Speaker 5>I think they're taking tweets and </v>
<v Speaker 5>putting that through it.</v>

2266
01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.713
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2267
01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:31.083
<v Speaker 5>Let's hear it.</v>

2268
01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Thank you to all the first responders </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people helping each other out.</v>

2269
01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.000
<v Speaker 3>It sounds terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do as Americans,</v>

2270
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.160
<v Speaker 5>why is it sounds so terrible to on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a.</v>

2271
01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 5>The way they have it set up like if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and me did it today,</v>

2272
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:43.993
<v Speaker 5>they have specific sentences that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>would need to read to hit the syllables </v>

2273
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:49.760
<v Speaker 5>and I think they're taking speeches and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they probably tried to find the words as</v>

2274
01:37:49.761 --> 01:37:50.594
<v Speaker 5>opposed to going directly into their </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer program which was built for </v>

2275
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:54.583
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only issue though is it doesn't </v>

2276
01:37:55.261 --> 01:37:57.630
<v Speaker 5>sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those don't because they didn't actually</v>

2277
01:37:57.631 --> 01:38:00.820
<v Speaker 5>have Obama reading specifically for them</v>
<v Speaker 5>into their car.</v>

2278
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 5>They just took speeches probably and </v>
<v Speaker 5>found the words that matter,</v>

2279
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.493
<v Speaker 5>but even if they took speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds so much shittier than the </v>

2280
01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:07.254
<v Speaker 5>actual speech itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to close my friend who </v>

2281
01:38:09.961 --> 01:38:11.910
<v Speaker 5>showed it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he did it himself and got really</v>

2282
01:38:11.911 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 5>surprised that he just typed a sentence </v>
<v Speaker 5>then and was like,</v>

2283
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:16.050
<v Speaker 5>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sounds like me.</v>

2284
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be able to have people </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying all kinds of crazy things.</v>

2285
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:20.963
<v Speaker 5>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not the Adobe Photoshop when </v>

2286
01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 5>this is I think a small company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're probably going to.</v>

2287
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Adobe's got a better make people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>feuds with people by saying a little.</v>

2288
01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.653
<v Speaker 5>You hear what you said about your man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was with this pretty fucked up and </v>

2289
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:33.271
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2290
01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:34.104
<v Speaker 5>We'll fuck him and then that guy says </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck him and so some crazy shit about </v>

2291
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:38.940
<v Speaker 5>him and the next thing you know the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality,</v>

2292
01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:39.774
<v Speaker 5>a TV show editing trick rich just said </v>
<v Speaker 5>off camera and you show somebody as </v>

2293
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:45.180
<v Speaker 5>reaction to what they heard and can send</v>
<v Speaker 5>that to your friend and be like,</v>

2294
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.440
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking pissed at you.</v>

2295
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:51.210
<v Speaker 5>And then just really easily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That could be an APP on your phone.</v>

2296
01:38:51.211 --> 01:38:54.450
<v Speaker 5>Just like that app where you put a puppy</v>
<v Speaker 5>dog nose on it.</v>

2297
01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:58.860
<v Speaker 5>How's it any different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as someone gives the green light</v>

2298
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.270
<v Speaker 5>to put that on the apple store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Google play store,</v>

2299
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:03.203
<v Speaker 5>someone's going to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>to use that to make weird copies of </v>

2300
01:39:06.421 --> 01:39:08.140
<v Speaker 5>people do have ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2301
01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.721
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's ethics.</v>

2302
01:39:09.721 --> 01:39:11.730
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out of here with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethics.</v>

2303
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.110
<v Speaker 5>Shut up once you pee in the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not extracting that stuff out and</v>

2304
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:18.150
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or at least they have samples.</v>

2305
01:39:18.151 --> 01:39:20.870
<v Speaker 5>They released a public awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 5>First,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to raise public awareness,</v>

2307
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:23.604
<v Speaker 5>to make people realize that technology </v>
<v Speaker 5>exists by releasing audio samples from </v>

2308
01:39:26.071 --> 01:39:28.500
<v Speaker 5>the digital voices of Donald Trump and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Barack Obama.</v>

2309
01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:29.543
<v Speaker 5>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to ensure that your digital </v>

2310
01:39:30.391 --> 01:39:33.630
<v Speaker 5>voice is yours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are the stewards of your voice,</v>

2311
01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:34.464
<v Speaker 5>but you control its usage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one can use it without your explicit </v>

2312
01:39:37.231 --> 01:39:37.940
<v Speaker 5>consent.</v>

2313
01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Shut your whole shy or whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying,</v>

2314
01:39:41.451 --> 01:39:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I can hold my breath forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

2315
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:46.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

2316
01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:47.503
<v Speaker 1>You can't control that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some wonky as website where </v>

2317
01:39:49.641 --> 01:39:50.474
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to pretend like they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>control the digital voice that gets </v>

2318
01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:56.660
<v Speaker 1>printed using their app like the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can this,</v>

2319
01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:57.613
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you've made some technology like </v>

2320
01:39:59.151 --> 01:40:01.970
<v Speaker 1>this is all your silly words that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing down,</v>

2321
01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.510
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're what are you going to violate?</v>

2322
01:40:05.511 --> 01:40:06.344
<v Speaker 1>All the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the known laws of technological </v>

2323
01:40:08.091 --> 01:40:11.210
<v Speaker 1>progression with your disclaimer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>

2324
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not really possible because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2326
01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.500
<v Speaker 1>They can tell through an analysis that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

2327
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:18.403
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like you were in that part </v>

2328
01:40:20.451 --> 01:40:21.780
<v Speaker 1>of the synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2329
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:24.410
<v Speaker 1>that's the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best it can do right now.</v>

2330
01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.273
<v Speaker 1>For now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure it's going to get better and </v>

2331
01:40:27.471 --> 01:40:28.910
<v Speaker 1>for sure they're not going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control it.</v>

2332
01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Like once it's gotten to that stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that crazy.</v>

2333
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:33.403
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a matter of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we have no idea what the fuck is </v>

2334
01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:39.530
<v Speaker 1>real and it's not at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not just hire an Obama impersonator?</v>

2335
01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as good because it Obama </v>

2336
01:40:41.781 --> 01:40:42.614
<v Speaker 1>impersonator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the best Obama impersonators just </v>

2337
01:40:44.361 --> 01:40:45.860
<v Speaker 1>affects similarly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2338
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.220
<v Speaker 1>there's such a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that the.</v>

2339
01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.180
<v Speaker 1>But the computer has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2340
01:40:50.181 --> 01:40:52.550
<v Speaker 1>unless it's just audio being played </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

2341
01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like simulating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you mean like a physical video?</v>

2342
01:40:56.591 --> 01:40:58.280
<v Speaker 1>That'll be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll definitely video.</v>

2343
01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.193
<v Speaker 1>They've already done it with video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me screaming over </v>

2344
01:41:02.171 --> 01:41:02.520
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

2345
01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.353
<v Speaker 4>Bottom of the site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had this little disclaimer </v>

2346
01:41:04.951 --> 01:41:05.784
<v Speaker 4>agreement regarding biometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I collect it and right here it's how we </v>

2347
01:41:07.981 --> 01:41:08.814
<v Speaker 4>disclose biometric data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We may also disclose biometric data in </v>

<v Speaker 1>They got their fingerprints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2356
01:41:33.490 --> 01:41:37.330
<v Speaker 1>your fingerprints off your phone data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast data.</v>

2357
01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.880
<v Speaker 1>They're collecting DNA from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens.</v>

2358
01:41:39.881 --> 01:41:43.990
<v Speaker 1>When you turn your phone and data is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being stored on a third party server,</v>

2359
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:45.460
<v Speaker 1>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says it right.</v>

2361
01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.090
<v Speaker 1>All that data's going to get scooped up </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Russians.</v>

2362
01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.610
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are going to have all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk and shit.</v>

2363
01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.373
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have heads of industry </v>

2364
01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 1>talking shit about Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening to kill him.</v>

2365
01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump's going to get crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid because he doesn't read.</v>

01:42:14.711 --> 01:42:16.480
<v Speaker 1>assassinate him because he wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

2371
01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vote for Zuckerberg.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When they say facebook know facebook,</v>

2375
01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:30.843
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still a little but not so </v>

2376
01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:33.274
<v Speaker 1>much as like someone who might be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>band and they break up and they make a </v>

2377
01:42:36.641 --> 01:42:38.640
<v Speaker 1>song and that was kind of based on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>riffs,</v>

2378
01:42:38.641 --> 01:42:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone was say.</v>

2379
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.733
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2380
01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.100
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he steal it?</v>

2381
01:42:42.101 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 1>A little like Chris Walks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ex wife steals money from him.</v>

2382
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Do that by just going to court and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing it just publicly.</v>

2383
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they do.</v>

2384
01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.300
<v Speaker 1>You get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2385

2388
01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

2389
01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy would definitely talk about</v>

2390
01:43:01.391 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 1>that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2391
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:03.274
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Murphy was talking about with </v>

2392
01:43:03.491 --> 01:43:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Carson.</v>

2393
01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:04.923
<v Speaker 1>Remember Johnny Carson and give up like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions dollars to some </v>

2394
01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:12.080
<v Speaker 1>chick he was briefly having sex with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2395
01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.490
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be.</v>

2396
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean not briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his entire life.</v>

2397
01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.180
<v Speaker 1>He to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that meant.</v>

2398
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Equally tell fucking single joke wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>an even deal.</v>

2399
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:25.220
<v Speaker 1>But that stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing,</v>

2400
01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:27.370
<v Speaker 1>stealing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did he steal in that way?</v>

2401
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Let Johnny Carson's wife still not May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2402
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:31.143
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2403
01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that he just had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had an idea of what to do with it so.</v>

2404
01:43:34.331 --> 01:43:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that he's necessarily.</v>

2405
01:43:37.331 --> 01:43:38.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean that can be proven wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he's necessarily an </v>

2406
01:43:40.391 --> 01:43:45.391
<v Speaker 1>innovator in any way at the key refined </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that was pretty obvious right in</v>

2407
01:43:46.601 --> 01:43:47.980
<v Speaker 1>my space had already existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2408
01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So people would register.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck used friendster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2410
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was one of the top dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love France.</v>

2411
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Shamiana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friendster tee shirt were everywhere.</v>

2412
01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.130

<v Speaker 1>It's so sad.</v>

2413
01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:58.993
<v Speaker 1>It's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2414
01:43:59.240 --> 01:43:59.811
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2415
01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 1>it's still there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's owned by somebody might spill.</v>

2416

<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence.</v>

2495
01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:39.340

<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2496
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:40.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>screen.</v>

2502
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:58.160
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if you went somewhere to</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch a hologram?</v>

2503
01:47:58.161 --> 01:48:00.650

2506
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:11.390
<v Speaker 5>unless it's someone who doesn't live </v>

<v Speaker 5>lay off the weights for a couple years </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to play Tupac.</v>

2532
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:07.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't think they would've been</v>

2533
01:49:07.221 --> 01:49:10.100
<v Speaker 5>able to track his performance in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nineties.</v>

2534
01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:11.053
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy who they used the body that </v>

2535
01:49:11.931 --> 01:49:12.764
<v Speaker 5>will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got overzealous because he's way </v>

2536
01:49:13.761 --> 01:49:16.640
<v Speaker 5>too big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's like 20 pounds heavier.</v>

2537
01:49:16.641 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

2538
01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:22.060
<v Speaker 5>I think he was wired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was wired with this guy.</v>

2539
01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.473
<v Speaker 5>This guy's Jack an MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's pulling tyron woodley almost </v>

2540
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:30.420
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a side by side.</v>

2541
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:32.300
<v Speaker 5>This captain Jack?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2542
01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:35.150
<v Speaker 5>he's getting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's built like George St Pierre.</v>

2543
01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:37.580
<v Speaker 5>Like that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good comparison.</v>

2544
01:49:37.581 --> 01:49:41.090
<v Speaker 5>Not Quite tyron woodley levels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but pretty fucking jacked.</v>

2545
01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:44.210
<v Speaker 5>You got a side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have one.</v>

2546
01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:47.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to ponder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fate just came up,</v>

2547
01:49:47.150 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>said it wasn't actually</v>

2548
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.350
<v Speaker 1>a Hologram and I'm trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2549
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means,</v>

2550
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 1>what CGI generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then special effects studio made it.</v>

2551
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expensive CGI.</v>

2552
01:49:56.650 --> 01:49:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's what I was saying.</v>

2553
01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they used a body double the </v>
<v Speaker 1>track,</v>

2554
01:49:59.681 --> 01:50:00.514
<v Speaker 1>the movements and then they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>overzealous when they went to give him </v>

2555
01:50:02.051 --> 01:50:06.060
<v Speaker 1>six packs and packs and just like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a star,</v>

2556
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:08.740
<v Speaker 1>a star wars figurines or like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>

2557
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:10.300
<v Speaker 1>They're all super muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2558
01:50:10.301 --> 01:50:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you skywalker's jagged?</v>

2559
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like it was like late nineties </v>

2560
01:50:15.161 --> 01:50:18.090
<v Speaker 1>star wars or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:20.643
<v Speaker 1>It's like super hero bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people wanted superhero bullshit </v>

2562
01:50:23.621 --> 01:50:24.454
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you tried to put out a figurine </v>

2563
01:50:26.471 --> 01:50:29.390
<v Speaker 1>of someone who wasn't jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people used to superhero figurines,</v>

2564
01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.720
<v Speaker 1>so it's just so dumb though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2565
01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I want something that looks like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2566
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking cheat because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it looks cheap.</v>

2567
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:37.750
<v Speaker 1>It looks lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Lazy.</v>

2569
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:43.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2570
01:50:45.011 --> 01:50:48.040
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have his shirt off his shirt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show the thug life tattoo.</v>

2591
01:51:27.011 --> 01:51:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Chicken breast,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Retics.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight in real life and we got to watch </v>

2607
01:51:59.531 --> 01:52:00.364
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess either way the fuck I am man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make me look more muscular than I </v>

2609
01:52:04.601 --> 01:52:06.100
<v Speaker 1>really am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more immersive.</v>

2610
01:52:06.210 --> 01:52:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the EA video game,</v>

2611
01:52:07.511 --> 01:52:10.870
<v Speaker 1>that's my actual body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took fucking hundreds of pictures.</v>

2612
01:52:10.871 --> 01:52:14.080
<v Speaker 1>They have you stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rotate around you with a camera.</v>

2613
01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:15.213
<v Speaker 1>They have this thing that spins around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and takes photos of all these </v>

2614
01:52:18.161 --> 01:52:19.270
<v Speaker 1>different precise angles.</v>

2615
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:21.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to do all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things with your body.</v>

2616
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.930
<v Speaker 1>You have to do things with your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to stand with your hands up,</v>

2617
01:52:23.931 --> 01:52:24.764
<v Speaker 1>you have to extend your fists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the doing the doing the </v>

2618
01:52:26.441 --> 01:52:29.500
<v Speaker 1>combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volumetric capture and optical capture.</v>

2619
01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they skin you.</v>

2620
01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:34.650
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The skin they put,</v>

2621
01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:39.460
<v Speaker 1>they basically skinny up the optical </v>
<v Speaker 1>information mixed stitched with a little</v>

2622
01:52:39.461 --> 01:52:40.390
<v Speaker 1>bit of CGI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2623
01:52:40.391 --> 01:52:42.040
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see that.</v>

2624
01:52:42.041 --> 01:52:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a person,</v>

2625
01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:46.080
<v Speaker 1>a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of person looks like.</v>

2626
01:52:46.081 --> 01:52:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean your face does look a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncanny valley,</v>

2627
01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:50.693
<v Speaker 1>but a video game character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are about five years away from </v>

2628
01:52:53.991 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not existing anymore.</v>

2629
01:52:55.131 --> 01:52:55.964
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five years away from just freaking the </v>

2630
01:52:57.261 --> 01:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>fuck out with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like avatar did a great job.</v>

2631
01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That CGI was like,</v>

2632
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of it was the actor's face.</v>

2633
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the rest of it,</v>

2634
01:53:05.391 --> 01:53:06.224
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looked very natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really cool is that they </v>

2635
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:09.343
<v Speaker 1>immediately for a movie like avatars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can have something that's not </v>

2636
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:14.090
<v Speaker 1>a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's really challenging?</v>

2637
01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a CGI of a real thing.</v>

2638
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:17.343
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or game of thrones do with wolves and </v>

2639
01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:23.930
<v Speaker 1>they have to be real careful about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shoot it like I am legend with will</v>

2640
01:53:23.931 --> 01:53:24.764
<v Speaker 1>Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did it with lions and it was kind </v>

2641
01:53:25.481 --> 01:53:26.390
<v Speaker 1>of clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2643
01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:27.943
<v Speaker 1>No that no zombies and I am legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That worked perfect because they this </v>

2644
01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:31.890
<v Speaker 1>thing a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2645

<v Speaker 1>It's just like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2646
01:53:32.841 --> 01:53:34.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a fantasy creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a point of reference.</v>

2647
01:53:34.971 --> 01:53:35.804
<v Speaker 1>What is this James</v>

2648
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:36.833
<v Speaker 5>from Logan that digitally did his face </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like almost all of these action </v>

2649
01:53:39.901 --> 01:53:42.630
<v Speaker 5>scenes because I don't know whether he </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't do it or not,</v>

2650
01:53:42.631 --> 01:53:43.464
<v Speaker 5>but a little piece just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it just came out this </v>

2651
01:53:45.630 --> 01:53:46.860
<v Speaker 5>week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just saw it the other day.</v>

2652
01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:48.083
<v Speaker 5>It's a really cool little three minute </v>
<v Speaker 5>piece about the digital doubles where </v>

2653
01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:52.740
<v Speaker 5>it's called of Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody wants to watch that.</v>

2654
01:53:52.890 --> 01:53:54.870
<v Speaker 5>I try to put up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that the stunt guy?</v>

2655
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the stunt guy and then they kind</v>

2656
01:53:56.331 --> 01:53:58.680
<v Speaker 5>of show the break though that that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the actual clip and they'll show you the</v>

2657
01:53:58.681 --> 01:54:01.090
<v Speaker 5>breakdown now of how they like added.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2658
01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:02.123
<v Speaker 5>Each little piece to it to make what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw from the little camera angles and </v>

2659
01:54:06.541 --> 01:54:08.340
<v Speaker 5>then lead shield.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is incredible.</v>

2660
01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:09.900
<v Speaker 5>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2661
01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:11.003
<v Speaker 5>that's so the dude just got a God this </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then this thing later here in a </v>

2662
01:54:17.491 --> 01:54:22.491
<v Speaker 5>second and show you how all the cameras </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they use to get his actual face.</v>

2663
01:54:22.710 --> 01:54:25.310
<v Speaker 5>So this was CGI.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2664
01:54:25.530 --> 01:54:26.940
<v Speaker 5>That scene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that whole scene.</v>

2665
01:54:28.110 --> 01:54:29.250
<v Speaker 5>These scenes where CGI.</v>

2666
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:35.180
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

2667
01:54:35.970 --> 01:54:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's fucked up?</v>

2668
01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:38.023
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still made it as obvious as a real </v>

2669
01:54:42.861 --> 01:54:47.120
<v Speaker 1>fight scene with actors and stuntmen </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't movement is real,</v>

2670
01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.640
<v Speaker 1>but it looks very obvious that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>

2671
01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:50.451
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2672
01:54:50.451 --> 01:54:51.280
<v Speaker 1>now it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.610
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the movie,</v>

2674
01:54:52.611 --> 01:54:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I mean.</v>

2675
01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:54.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks very obvious that it's a fake </v>

2676
01:54:56.271 --> 01:54:57.500
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

2677
01:54:57.530 --> 01:54:58.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks great.</v>

2678
01:54:58.770 --> 01:54:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2679
01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't actually have a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>punched the guy.</v>

2680
01:55:02.331 --> 01:55:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't actually have the guy shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>him first,</v>

2681
01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he absorbs the bullet and keeps </v>

2682
01:55:07.491 --> 01:55:09.570
<v Speaker 1>going and cuts the guy's head off with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2683
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 1>with his claws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they could have done something along</v>

2684
01:55:13.341 --> 01:55:14.210
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2685
01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.053
<v Speaker 1>they choreographed it like they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>choreograph like a fight scene and a </v>

2686
01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 1>$6,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>man episode.</v>

2687
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:21.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2688
01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna Punch you.</v>

2689
01:55:22.161 --> 01:55:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stabbed me first,</v>

2690
01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to shoot you long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Cut.</v>

2691
01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:25.971
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2692
01:55:25.971 --> 01:55:26.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2693
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 1>that's my thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a tactical scenes and fight scenes.</v>

2694
01:55:31.490 --> 01:55:33.410
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it,</v>

2695
01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.273
<v Speaker 1>it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to balance the </v>

2696
01:55:35.871 --> 01:55:36.704
<v Speaker 1>believability level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's kind of cartoony acts like </v>

2697
01:55:40.161 --> 01:55:40.994
<v Speaker 1>violence or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then make sure that the physics flow </v>

2698
01:55:43.381 --> 01:55:44.020
<v Speaker 1>together really</v>

2699
01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.590
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like captain America winter soldier,</v>

2700
01:55:46.591 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2701
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:52.050
<v Speaker 3>of the marvel movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the fight scenes are incredible.</v>

2702
01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 3>They really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really well done and pretty bad ass.</v>

2703
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:55.433
<v Speaker 3>Pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when fucking winter soldier gets </v>

2704
01:55:56.581 --> 01:55:58.680
<v Speaker 3>hit and he likes slides backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2705
01:55:58.681 --> 01:55:59.514
<v Speaker 3>there's always that thing where a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets hit and he slides backwards and </v>

2706
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:03.930
<v Speaker 3>pavement gets torn up and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>holding a stance.</v>

2707
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.230
<v Speaker 3>But the physics on it looked really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2708
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:08.431
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2709
01:56:08.431 --> 01:56:09.264
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were just paying attention to </v>

2710
01:56:10.031 --> 01:56:10.864
<v Speaker 3>all these little subtle physics details </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what makes me appreciate the </v>

2711
01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:19.490
<v Speaker 3>fighting or like seeing Gina Carano a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight like fake fight in movies.</v>

2712
01:56:19.491 --> 01:56:20.820
<v Speaker 3>She knows how to take a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2713
01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:23.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when she gets hit,</v>

2714
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.320
<v Speaker 3>she knows what it looks like when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get hit,</v>

2715
01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:26.293
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certain way or certain angle or </v>

2716
01:56:27.301 --> 01:56:29.910
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not saying that she's the best best,</v>

2717
01:56:29.911 --> 01:56:30.744
<v Speaker 3>but just as an example of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually does make contact or has had </v>

2718
01:56:33.931 --> 01:56:34.764
<v Speaker 3>experience in that the reactions are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more believable and also </v>

2719
01:56:38.911 --> 01:56:42.570
<v Speaker 3>they're probably more willing to let </v>
<v Speaker 3>people get close closer I'm sure.</v>

2720
01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:45.270
<v Speaker 3>And also you don't feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>being treated like a fool.</v>

2721
01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm,</v>

2722
01:56:46.650 --> 01:56:47.483
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm talking about because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's otherwise it's just like let you </v>

2723
01:56:50.461 --> 01:56:53.270
<v Speaker 3>see the people waiting for the next hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see this,</v>

2724
01:56:53.271 --> 01:56:54.104
<v Speaker 3>those fight scenes were people standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>around in a circle and one guy goes in </v>

2725
01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.000
<v Speaker 3>and then everyone else is waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would not work like that,</v>

2726
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:00.740
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2727
01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.370
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's just going to wait.</v>

2728
01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just one guy at a time.</v>

2729
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the next.</v>

2730
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you try it,</v>

2731
01:57:06.901 --> 01:57:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

2732
01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:09.420
<v Speaker 3>He's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2733
01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Walter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.453
<v Speaker 3>It has to be some like that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I've found almost yearly </v>

2735
01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:19.950
<v Speaker 3>impressive about John Wick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Wick is preposterous.</v>

2736
01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:22.620
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2737
01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:23.573
<v Speaker 3>They balanced that shit so when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>it out because you see it as </v>

2738
01:57:25.951 --> 01:57:26.784
<v Speaker 3>choreography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so fucking tactically and </v>

2739
01:57:30.391 --> 01:57:35.040
<v Speaker 3>imaginatively thought out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stylistically gorgeous and all the,</v>

2740
01:57:35.041 --> 01:57:37.180
<v Speaker 3>all the ingredients go together and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see those,</v>

2741
01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:38.530
<v Speaker 3>that footage of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2742
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:39.383
<v Speaker 3>running three gun training or these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking rock and through those courses </v>

2743
01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:45.070
<v Speaker 3>for real because he's using live rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2744
01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:47.190
<v Speaker 3>and so when I see that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2745
01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:48.053
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys know what the fuck they're </v>

2746
01:57:49.291 --> 01:57:49.650
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2747
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:50.483
<v Speaker 3>They're not fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like using special forces guys </v>

2748
01:57:53.071 --> 01:57:53.904
<v Speaker 3>for training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're using a specialized team of </v>

2749
01:57:56.190 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 3>martial artists to create a customized </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of martial arts.</v>

2750
01:57:59.761 --> 01:58:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Just for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend,</v>

2751
01:58:01.171 --> 01:58:05.210
<v Speaker 3>he and Machado did a lot of the Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>choreographed choreography for it.</v>

2752
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:06.660
<v Speaker 3>That's who I was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2753
01:58:06.661 --> 01:58:09.150
<v Speaker 3>And I love their whole fucking take on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and their approach.</v>

2754
01:58:09.151 --> 01:58:12.000
<v Speaker 3>It's artistry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what it is.</v>

2755
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:14.790
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything that he did woodwork,</v>

2756
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.133
<v Speaker 3>there was no jump up and kick two dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the head at the same time and shoot </v>

2757
01:58:18.301 --> 01:58:20.970
<v Speaker 3>through a window and shoot a guy a mile </v>
<v Speaker 3>away and the head no,</v>

2758
01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:21.661
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2759
01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:21.931
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2760
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:22.764
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you trained really well and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that situation presented itself the way </v>

2761
01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:29.550
<v Speaker 3>that it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do that.</v>

2762
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:31.680
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2763
01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:33.930
<v Speaker 3>but it was also very cartoony to </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

2764
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what,</v>

2765
01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.820
<v Speaker 3>that's what that was so great about it.</v>

2766
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:36.653
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this perfect because the whole </v>

2767
01:58:37.651 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 3>world was heightened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2768
01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:42.940
<v Speaker 3>like the whole hotel thing and assassins</v>
<v Speaker 3>having like great grants and the courts.</v>

2769
01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:47.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's already in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just need to create efficiency,</v>

2770
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in all it is,</v>

2771
01:58:48.761 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 3>is just like lethal efficiency with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a kiss of artistry.</v>

2772
01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:56.200
<v Speaker 3>And there's a uniformity and John Wick's</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

2773
01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2774
01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 3>so Samurai that you believe that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do all this and not be affected by</v>

2775
01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:03.000
<v Speaker 3>killing all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2776
01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it's like.</v>

2777
01:59:04.481 --> 01:59:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's killing our.</v>

2778
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Our our players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2779
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:09.460
<v Speaker 3>They're all players in the game and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve it.</v>

2780
01:59:09.461 --> 01:59:10.294
<v Speaker 3>They killed his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It killed his dog and anybody who gets </v>

2781
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:14.200
<v Speaker 3>in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that it's their fault,</v>

2782
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:18.040
<v Speaker 3>but if they decide to take him on then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he just has to.</v>

2783
01:59:18.041 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just professional.</v>

2784
01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:21.500
<v Speaker 3>He's a professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in his revenge,</v>

2785
01:59:21.501 --> 01:59:22.061
<v Speaker 3>she's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2786
01:59:22.061 --> 01:59:22.894
<v Speaker 3>except for the part where it shoots the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude in the hotel and gets </v>

2787
01:59:24.671 --> 01:59:26.080
<v Speaker 3>excommunicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other than that,</v>

2788
01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just love that character so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

2789
01:59:30.161 --> 01:59:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I love the stunt driving and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>CGI.</v>

2790
01:59:32.201 --> 01:59:33.034
<v Speaker 3>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's as a 51 year old man fucking </v>

2791
01:59:35.621 --> 01:59:38.050
<v Speaker 3>destroying it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2792
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:39.033
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you like that type of stuff or </v>

2793
01:59:41.201 --> 01:59:43.450
<v Speaker 3>if you don't like that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just watch a scene.</v>

2794
01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Look at the artistry of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>choreography.</v>

2795
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Think about how old he is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardy,</v>

2796
01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.153
<v Speaker 3>train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then try to have someone who's </v>

2797
01:59:49.651 --> 01:59:51.310
<v Speaker 3>sitting on the couch going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't lose.</v>

2798
01:59:51.670 --> 01:59:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I can't lose that 30 pounds without.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm talking about someone who has</v>

2799
01:59:56.711 --> 01:59:58.240
<v Speaker 3>no help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just them alone,</v>

2800
01:59:58.241 --> 01:59:59.074
<v Speaker 3>just going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2801
01:59:59.290 --> 02:00:00.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2802
02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:03.520
<v Speaker 3>it anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any anything is possible.</v>

2803
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.250
<v Speaker 3>You just have to fucking do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2804
02:00:06.251 --> 02:00:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that movie is like,</v>

2805
02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.533
<v Speaker 3>it's a masterpiece of that genre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of those style movies are </v>

2806
02:00:15.761 --> 02:00:17.680
<v Speaker 3>fun and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2807
02:00:17.681 --> 02:00:20.500
<v Speaker 3>I think what John Wick movies did is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they took that.</v>

2808
02:00:20.501 --> 02:00:23.350
<v Speaker 3>They boiled down the story too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's no.</v>

2809
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 3>There's no ambiguity as to whether or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not there's bad people and good people.</v>

2810
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not I should kill all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking goofball.</v>

2811
02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should kill them all.</v>

2812
02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:33.250
<v Speaker 3>He's absolutely going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

2813
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:35.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's okay because it's a game.</v>

2814
02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:36.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2815
02:00:36.281 --> 02:00:38.440
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so brilliant about it.</v>

2816
02:00:38.441 --> 02:00:39.274
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it allows stunt men tactical expert </v>

2817
02:00:42.881 --> 02:00:46.720
<v Speaker 3>forward moviemaking because it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

2818
02:00:46.721 --> 02:00:50.080
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly that the stair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story kind of takes you along and an</v>

2819
02:00:50.081 --> 02:00:52.000
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a pretty narrow pathway.</v>

2820
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.863
<v Speaker 3>The rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the apocalypse now of like shoot </v>

2821
02:00:56.201 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 3>'em off of tactical thrillers or </v>
<v Speaker 3>tactical,</v>

2822
02:00:58.781 --> 02:01:00.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever you call them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you would call those.</v>

2823
02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:02.560
<v Speaker 3>The masterpiece of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2824
02:01:02.561 --> 02:01:04.150
<v Speaker 3>if you get a chance,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2826
02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:07.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a cinemax show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2827
02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.250
<v Speaker 3>to show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2828
02:01:09.251 --> 02:01:11.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cinemax was real anymore.</v>

2829
02:01:11.670 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Too many networks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know skinemax people started.</v>

2830
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I remember that back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Softcore porn and be like,</v>

2831
02:01:19.181 --> 02:01:22.330
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

2832
02:01:22.331 --> 02:01:23.164
<v Speaker 3>They would lie down on the bed and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lady's leg and naked Lakewood drape </v>

2833
02:01:25.961 --> 02:01:27.820
<v Speaker 3>around the man's body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you knew what was going on.</v>

2834
02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

02:06:59.371 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 3>Montana at the time because I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers and sisters and I just happened</v>

<v Speaker 3>Christmas.</v>

2981
02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:07.253

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:33.360
<v Speaker 3>the thing is people used to think it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>high fat.</v>

2992
02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Did you read that thing in the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>Times about where</v>

2993
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.813
<v Speaker 2>that all came from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why people think saturated </v>

2994
02:07:38.381 --> 02:07:40.190
<v Speaker 2>fat is bad for you yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2995
02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:41.033
<v Speaker 2>I know that certain amounts of fats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain fats are awesome for you on </v>

2996
02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:46.960
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all came from the New York Times.</v>

2997
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all came from the sugar industry.</v>

2998
02:07:49.150 --> 02:07:49.983
<v Speaker 2>The sugar industry bribed all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists and they didn't even have to </v>

2999
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:53.320
<v Speaker 2>pay him much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3000
02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it was only like $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bribed these scientists to study,</v>

3001
02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:02.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to report some bogus findings,</v>

3002
02:08:02.770 --> 02:08:05.740
<v Speaker 2>pushing the blame away from sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto saturated fat.</v>

3003
02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

3004
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To this day,</v>

3005
02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>people think saturated fat is bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3006
02:08:11.111 --> 02:08:11.944
<v Speaker 2>There's something that I tweeted earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>today that I was reading about </v>

3007
02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:17.500
<v Speaker 2>saturated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to even cholesterol.</v>

3008
02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Cholesterol is the precursor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what you need.</v>

3009
02:08:20.741 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a substrate for hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

3010
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:23.411
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3011
02:08:23.411 --> 02:08:24.930
<v Speaker 2>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just saying like,</v>

3012
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:27.430
<v Speaker 2>there's so much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much.</v>

3013
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Dietary cholesterol is not even a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dire.</v>

3014
02:08:29.610 --> 02:08:30.443
<v Speaker 2>Taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terry cholesterol apparently doesn't </v>

3015
02:08:31.421 --> 02:08:33.850
<v Speaker 2>even move your blood lipids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's genetic.</v>

3016
02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:35.013
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have high cholesterol has to do with </v>

3017
02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:40.270
<v Speaker 2>your lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a sedentary,</v>

3018
02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:41.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3019
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:42.633
<v Speaker 2>A lot of sugar and carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I posted earlier </v>

3020
02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:47.253
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fat when fat people or rather when </v>

3021
02:08:48.311 --> 02:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>people eat saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risk of stroke drops.</v>

3022
02:08:51.250 --> 02:08:54.130
<v Speaker 2>If they're also avoiding refined </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>

3023
02:08:54.131 --> 02:08:54.964
<v Speaker 2>their triglycerides also come down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what they're saying is that when </v>

3024
02:08:58.691 --> 02:08:59.524
<v Speaker 2>people eat saturated fat in conjunction </v>
<v Speaker 2>with eating a lot of refined </v>

3025
02:09:04.001 --> 02:09:06.490
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates like white flour and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

3026
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:11.820
<v Speaker 2>it's not good for you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the that that saturated fat is bad is</v>

3027
02:09:12.461 --> 02:09:13.294
<v Speaker 2>the wrong culprit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like saturated fat might be bad for you </v>

3028
02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:18.280
<v Speaker 2>if you had refined carbohydrates because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like.</v>

3029
02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:19.990
<v Speaker 2>You're just fucking your whole system </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

3030
02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:23.290
<v Speaker 2>but if you can remove the refined </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>

3031
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:24.303
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat consumers have a lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk of stroke and their triglycerides </v>

3032
02:09:29.171 --> 02:09:29.860
<v Speaker 2>come down to the.</v>

3033
02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:33.940
<v Speaker 2>You actually get healthier by eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>saturated fat without carbohydrates.</v>

3034
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.980
<v Speaker 2>That's totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does make sense,</v>

3035
02:09:35.981 --> 02:09:38.170
<v Speaker 2>but this is all new shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3036
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:39.483
<v Speaker 2>These separated it that they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like they just kind of finally </v>

3037
02:09:41.921 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 2>went like it's kind of true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only true in combination.</v>

3038
02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:46.293
<v Speaker 2>It's only true in combination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you extract the one that we know to </v>

3039
02:09:48.521 --> 02:09:49.354
<v Speaker 2>be bad because there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many studies right now showing that low </v>

3040
02:09:51.101 --> 02:09:51.934
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate diets are beneficial for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different total health </v>

3041
02:09:54.131 --> 02:09:54.964
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you take out these refined </v>

3042
02:09:57.071 --> 02:09:57.904
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out the saturated fat is good </v>

3043
02:09:59.381 --> 02:10:00.480
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't been.</v>

3044
02:10:00.481 --> 02:10:02.290
<v Speaker 2>We've known them for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean carbs.</v>

3045
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Refined carbs are not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3046
02:10:05.141 --> 02:10:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't know how bad they were.</v>

3047
02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're realizing now more how bad</v>

3048
02:10:09.731 --> 02:10:10.564
<v Speaker 2>they are and how important saturated fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and unsaturated fats are and there's a </v>

3049
02:10:13.991 --> 02:10:16.630
<v Speaker 2>lot of saturated fats even for plant </v>
<v Speaker 2>based folks.</v>

3050
02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 2>You get a certain percentage of it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Avocados,</v>

3051
02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I think you can get a little bit of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from coconut oil,</v>

3052
02:10:21.970 --> 02:10:23.670
<v Speaker 2>certain percentage of it from coconut </v>
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>

3053
02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's they're saying coconut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>

3054
02:10:26.081 --> 02:10:28.390
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of a thing was widely </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized by signing.</v>

3055
02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.780
<v Speaker 2>That was the hardest association wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they.</v>

3056
02:10:31.781 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>These all these scientists got together </v>
<v Speaker 2>in on.</v>

3057
02:10:33.921 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

3058
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:34.873
<v Speaker 1>actually published an article about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we sent essentially the American </v>

3059
02:10:37.461 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>heart association is kind of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like their research is kind of Shitty,</v>

3060
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:46.160
<v Speaker 1>like too bad there are behind the times </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it makes sense.</v>

3061
02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:49.340
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the cutting edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>

3062
02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:50.174
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's so confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's constantly revolving around the </v>

3063
02:10:53.211 --> 02:10:54.044
<v Speaker 1>latest science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're not using the latest </v>

3064
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>science cutting edge new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not using the latest cutting edge</v>

3065
02:10:58.161 --> 02:10:58.994
<v Speaker 1>in nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're talking about some shit </v>

3066
02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:00.764
<v Speaker 1>that they discovered the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of possibility that you </v>

3067
02:11:04.551 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>might be wrong is tainted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3068
02:11:06.771 --> 02:11:07.604
<v Speaker 1>I mean that totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's something that I tend to </v>

3069
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:11.660
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3070
02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:14.780
<v Speaker 1>my thing is like I just try to eat like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what would a diabetic do,</v>

3071
02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:17.030
<v Speaker 1>like that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good starting place.</v>

3072
02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplicity,</v>

3073
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

3074
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken breast,</v>

3075
02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:24.080
<v Speaker 1>lean fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snapper,</v>

3076
02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:25.700
<v Speaker 1>brown rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oatmeal,</v>

3077
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:26.920
<v Speaker 1>steam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli,</v>

3078
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:30.220
<v Speaker 1>steamed Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm egg whites,</v>

3079
02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.220
<v Speaker 1>egg white protein.</v>

3080
02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>But even egg whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>egg whites are not nearly as healthy for</v>

3081
02:11:34.131 --> 02:11:34.964
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Egg yolks?</v>

3082
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:36.283
<v Speaker 1>Yolks are actually better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It yolks have more protein in them </v>

3083
02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:39.231
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3084
02:11:39.231 --> 02:11:41.150
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of vitamins that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get an egg,</v>

3085
02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:43.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about the powder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:11:43.631 --> 02:11:44.464
<v Speaker 1>like the more protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a good percentage of the protein I </v>

3087
02:11:46.071 --> 02:11:47.510
<v Speaker 1>should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more cholesterol.</v>

3088
02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.180
<v Speaker 1>The cholesterol is really the thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3089
02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Like Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Jay Robb,</v>

3090
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:52.341
<v Speaker 1>egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white protein,</v>

3091
02:11:52.341 --> 02:11:53.174
<v Speaker 1>that stuff is so fucking crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great and it mixes really well if </v>

3092
02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:57.380
<v Speaker 1>they think they could put the yolk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3093
02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever use plant based protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pea protein is really good.</v>

3094
02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Pump protein if you have from a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>source.</v>

3095
02:12:03.650 --> 02:12:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've used all of those things.</v>

3096
02:12:05.031 --> 02:12:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess egg white is like the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily one of the most easily absorbed,</v>

3097
02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:10.940
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3098
02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:12.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's just kind of simple.</v>

3099
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:16.450
<v Speaker 1>What I like about is that it's simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just comes from an unrefined ish,</v>

3100
02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refined to get it to a powder.</v>

3101
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I would say the issue is</v>

3102
02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:23.660
<v Speaker 1>in the dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydration process.</v>

3103
02:12:23.661 --> 02:12:24.494
<v Speaker 1>It's so different than with hamp where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially just getting the </v>

3104
02:12:26.871 --> 02:12:31.190
<v Speaker 1>plant fiber grind to get down to a fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>powder and then you eat it.</v>

3105
02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's super easy to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>

3106
02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:34.553
<v Speaker 1>like squeezed juice except for it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dried plant versus a dehydrated liquid </v>

3107
02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:42.450
<v Speaker 1>product to kind of liquidy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3108
02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:42.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3109
02:12:42.811 --> 02:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of.</v>

3110
02:12:43.810 --> 02:12:44.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3111
02:12:44.541 --> 02:12:45.374
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

3112
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:46.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they are,</v>

3113
02:12:46.221 --> 02:12:48.980
<v Speaker 1>they start that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you cook them or.</v>

3114
02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could have them raw.</v>

3115
02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Well you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got,</v>

3116
02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:52.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source apparently catching </v>

3117
02:12:54.570 --> 02:12:56.390
<v Speaker 1>salmonella though from backyard </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens.</v>

3118
02:12:56.570 --> 02:12:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

3119
02:12:57.561 --> 02:12:59.390
<v Speaker 1>that is an issue now there's some far.</v>

3120
02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3121
02:13:00.351 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was that huge movement.</v>

3122
02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like urban movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people who are closer together,</v>

3123
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:07.190
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

3124
02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on.</v>

3125
02:13:08.541 --> 02:13:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat it raw.</v>

3126
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:10.723
<v Speaker 1>Just because you've got it in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard does not necessarily mean it's </v>

3127
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:15.800
<v Speaker 1>100 percent safety role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3128
02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:16.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3129
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my thing is like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I do like salmon.</v>

3134
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:28.640

<v Speaker 1>which is really good if you can.</v>

3135
02:13:28.670 --> 02:13:29.503
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Hamachi how much he is just a </v>

<v Speaker 1>I know you used to in Montana and grew </v>

3140
02:13:44.611 --> 02:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>up in Montana.</v>

3141

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3142
02:13:47.311 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 1>not fly fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like boat fish,</v>

3143
02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.590
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Forget that.</v>

3147
02:13:56.431 --> 02:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to a rainbow lake.</v>

3148
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I think rainbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flat head sometimes.</v>

3149
02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:05.550
<v Speaker 1>We went to Bozeman last summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family,</v>

3150
02:14:05.551 --> 02:14:07.980
<v Speaker 1>and we went whitewater rafting down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gallatin.</v>

3151
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:09.420
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3152
02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.120
<v Speaker 1>You get soaked though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the shade,</v>

3153
02:14:12.121 --> 02:14:16.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to freeze your dick off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was glacial runoff.</v>

3154
02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:20.490
<v Speaker 1>The only one of the few times I noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a shadow and not shadow.</v>

3155
02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the sun,</v>

3156
02:14:21.601 --> 02:14:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

3157
02:14:22.050 --> 02:14:23.070
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll dry off.</v>

3158
02:14:23.071 --> 02:14:23.904
<v Speaker 1>I'll be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in the cold in the water </v>

3159
02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>is cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3160
02:14:28.271 --> 02:14:29.104
<v Speaker 1>You're so fucked and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take one step into the sunlight and </v>

3161
02:14:31.141 --> 02:14:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like breathing.</v>

3162
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:34.583
<v Speaker 1>That Galton's weird because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that fly fish in that </v>

3163
02:14:37.891 --> 02:14:38.724
<v Speaker 1>gallatin river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost everybody releases the fish </v>

3164
02:14:41.551 --> 02:14:42.384
<v Speaker 1>that they catch.</v>

3165
02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:44.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3166
02:14:44.411 --> 02:14:45.244
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got you.</v>

3167
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like the sportsman.</v>

3168
02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on it.</v>

3169
02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Rather than just you just tricking this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish sticking out,</v>

3170
02:14:51.590 --> 02:14:55.080
<v Speaker 1>hook in his head and then you're pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to shore and then let it go.</v>

3171
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Letting it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many times,</v>

3172
02:14:57.001 --> 02:15:00.900
<v Speaker 1>if this is like a stream or a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on this river,</v>

3173
02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:01.853
<v Speaker 1>if a lot of people fly fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds that a fish gets </v>

3174
02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:09.870
<v Speaker 1>caught and released?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like several times and it's life man.</v>

3175
02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:10.913
<v Speaker 1>That'd be something to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're getting a hook Jesus again </v>

3176
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:16.890
<v Speaker 1>or maybe like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3177
02:15:16.891 --> 02:15:18.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it because I'm still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3178
02:15:20.730 --> 02:15:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3179
02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:24.180
<v Speaker 1>don't think that they have nerve </v>
<v Speaker 1>endings.</v>

3180
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:28.120
<v Speaker 1>The in their mouth the way I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

3181
02:15:28.170 --> 02:15:31.200
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the tissue in their mouth other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than their throat is like,</v>

3182
02:15:31.201 --> 02:15:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost like a fingernail.</v>

3183
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the way I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3184
02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:36.440
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3185
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean because that was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>

3186
02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I love fish but I'm a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussy about killing,</v>

3187
02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:42.913
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I have to Kinda like get into a </v>

3188
02:15:44.551 --> 02:15:45.690
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3189
02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:47.280
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I could,</v>

3190
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I could do it if I needed to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to cut.</v>

3191
02:15:48.970 --> 02:15:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with that.</v>

3192
02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:52.890
<v Speaker 1>What about an ugly fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a flounder?</v>

3193
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:54.143
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the kid trying to not step on </v>

3194
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:58.820
<v Speaker 1>ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3195
02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:00.510
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like very much.</v>

3196
02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:01.373
<v Speaker 1>Even though I do eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I will say I'm really stoked </v>

3197
02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:05.250
<v Speaker 1>about Memphis meats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memphis meats.</v>

3198
02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memphis meats.</v>

3199
02:16:06.241 --> 02:16:10.290
<v Speaker 1>They're out of San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're growing steaks and chicken.</v>

3200
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.293
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that actual steak and actual chicken </v>

3201
02:16:13.591 --> 02:16:15.510
<v Speaker 1>or is it a Vegan alternative from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells?</v>

3202
02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:18.110
<v Speaker 1>The animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get a Zombie idea.</v>

3203
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:19.990
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean something.</v>

3204
02:16:20.010 --> 02:16:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So it was good but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3205
02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that it's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because like,</v>

3206
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I was Vegan for like seven years and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

3207
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you get people mad at you because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3208
02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:29.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten some people like I thought </v>

3209
02:16:30.131 --> 02:16:30.964
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were a vegetarian or </v>

3210
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you open minded?</v>

3211
02:16:33.071 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you could.</v>

3212
02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:35.393
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is like I do care and I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty particular about the sources of </v>

3213
02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:40.420
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very particular,</v>

3214
02:16:40.421 --> 02:16:41.254
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am excited about this idea of </v>

3215
02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:45.080
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3216
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.053
<v Speaker 1>it poses an interesting question to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's choosing to be Vegan for </v>

3217
02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:52.960
<v Speaker 1>ethical reasons or health reasons or </v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

3218
02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if meat was able to be grown,</v>

3219
02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:00.980
<v Speaker 1>like saying that you liked me before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>became one you liked.</v>

3220
02:17:01.010 --> 02:17:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like the ethical reasons.</v>

3221
02:17:03.731 --> 02:17:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Make sense for health reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

3222
02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I would feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3223
02:17:07.061 --> 02:17:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it's probably just as bad for you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse unless,</v>

3224
02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:12.820
<v Speaker 1>unless you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you feel bad when you eat certain</v>

3225
02:17:12.821 --> 02:17:13.840
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like emotionally,</v>

3226
02:17:13.841 --> 02:17:16.330
<v Speaker 1>but if you have a reaction to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people do have,</v>

3227
02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.360
<v Speaker 1>that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people to do,</v>

3228
02:17:18.390 --> 02:17:19.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real common thing recently </v>

3229
02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:23.440
<v Speaker 1>about that lone star tick disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3230
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:25.960
<v Speaker 1>People getting allergic to meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

3231
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:27.390
<v Speaker 1>some weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3232
02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Something that is in the bite of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

3233
02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:31.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called,</v>

3234
02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:35.800
<v Speaker 1>they call it Alpha Gal for short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you get this,</v>

3235
02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you develop this allergy to this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists in red meat.</v>

3236
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And so when people get bitten by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one particular tick,</v>

3237
02:17:42.521 --> 02:17:46.690
<v Speaker 1>they literally develop an allergy to red</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat and it can subside over time.</v>

3238
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.943
<v Speaker 1>But for a lot of people they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stick to chicken and fish </v>

3239
02:17:50.321 --> 02:17:51.154
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally become allergic to eat </v>

3240
02:17:52.410 --> 02:17:53.680
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they become healthier.</v>

3241
02:17:53.681 --> 02:17:55.960
<v Speaker 1>But I don't necessarily see that's where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

3242
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:58.920
<v Speaker 1>That's where the whole saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument comes into shirt.</v>

3243
02:17:59.090 --> 02:18:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess it depends on the Diet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this confusion about whether</v>

3244
02:18:03.521 --> 02:18:06.970
<v Speaker 1>or not red meat is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of these studies that show</v>

3245
02:18:06.971 --> 02:18:09.970
<v Speaker 1>that there's a direct correlation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between red meat and heart attacks.</v>

3246
02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:13.810
<v Speaker 1>What they don't do is differentiate what</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of red meat.</v>

3247
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:17.410
<v Speaker 1>They don't make a differentiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between red meat that's grass fed,</v>

3248
02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:22.620
<v Speaker 1>pasture raised cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very healthy or bison versus a fast</v>

3249
02:18:22.751 --> 02:18:23.584
<v Speaker 1>food burger with a white bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buns and French fries and a soda with </v>

3250
02:18:27.671 --> 02:18:29.240
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3251
02:18:29.290 --> 02:18:30.123
<v Speaker 1>because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the fact that people eat red </v>

3252
02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:33.124
<v Speaker 1>meat on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't take into consideration what </v>

3253
02:18:35.381 --> 02:18:36.490
<v Speaker 1>they eat that red meat with.</v>

3254
02:18:36.490 --> 02:18:37.323
<v Speaker 1>And there's a giant difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating a piece of grass fed meat with </v>

3255
02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:44.590
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3256
02:18:44.591 --> 02:18:45.424
<v Speaker 1>maybe a Yam versus eating a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl's junior double cheeseburger with </v>

3257
02:18:49.931 --> 02:18:54.931
<v Speaker 1>fake bacon just dripping with funk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugary,</v>

3258
02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:57.260
<v Speaker 1>sugary sauces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3259
02:18:57.290 --> 02:19:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make the people do.</v>

3260
02:19:00.130 --> 02:19:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And so the correlation between like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good.</v>

3261
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:08.320
<v Speaker 1>These are not good tests because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between red meat and cancer,</v>

3262
02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you could say maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

3263
02:19:10.871 --> 02:19:11.704
<v Speaker 1>but not the way you guys showed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you guys showed it as just </v>

3264
02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:18.340
<v Speaker 1>eating red meat with a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit versus eating red meat and living a</v>

3265
02:19:18.341 --> 02:19:19.280
<v Speaker 1>healthy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3266
02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And eating with vegetables and having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would call a balanced diet.</v>

3267
02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:23.573
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that it's all the same </v>

3268
02:19:25.630 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 1>because it's just not great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3269
02:19:27.350 --> 02:19:28.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with that.</v>

3270
02:19:28.491 --> 02:19:29.324
<v Speaker 1>I mean for me the red meat is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just feel better if I'm not eating </v>

3271
02:19:31.791 --> 02:19:32.624
<v Speaker 1>it all the time and I just prefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken or whatever to to a lot of </v>

3272
02:19:35.181 --> 02:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>people have different.</v>

3273
02:19:36.350 --> 02:19:38.300
<v Speaker 1>They have different reactions to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

3274
02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:39.553
<v Speaker 1>I know several people that have celiacs </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they literally can't consume any </v>

3275
02:19:42.921 --> 02:19:43.754
<v Speaker 1>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a bunch of people that have that </v>

3276
02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:46.093
<v Speaker 1>and for those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's obviously different than </v>

3277
02:19:47.601 --> 02:19:50.570
<v Speaker 1>mine because mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I eat bread,</v>

3278
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel as good feed a big ass sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>sub.</v>

3279
02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It feels great while it's going down for</v>
<v Speaker 1>an afternoon crash.</v>

3280
02:20:01.430 --> 02:20:02.263
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to remember that because </v>

3281
02:20:04.101 --> 02:20:05.480
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I just want the thing,</v>

3282
02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:06.763
<v Speaker 1>the difference between A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an in and out double double with a </v>

3283
02:20:09.471 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 1>button versus protein style with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lettuce.</v>

3284
02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing.</v>

3285
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

3286
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's like,</v>

3287
02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:20.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3288
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:21.503
<v Speaker 1>feeling menial or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really nice because it's like </v>

3289
02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>a very lean cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but blue cheese on the.</v>

3290
02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:27.913
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about.</v>

3291
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3292
02:20:29.841 --> 02:20:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I like the blue cheese for laymen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All,</v>

3293
02:20:33.010 --> 02:20:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you know Jamie's to white bread from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio.</v>

3294
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:41.240
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know what blue cheeses </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there turn into a cheeseburger.</v>

3295
02:20:41.241 --> 02:20:42.074
<v Speaker 1>Just leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no blue cheese with a little </v>

3296
02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:48.060
<v Speaker 1>crumbled blue cheese with some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>

3297
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

3298
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also like Philemon,</v>

3299
02:20:53.871 --> 02:20:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Yana is a boring cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rib eyes.</v>

3300
02:20:56.511 --> 02:20:57.344
<v Speaker 1>The cut just like cooked in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a fucking nice dark surface on </v>

3301
02:21:03.141 --> 02:21:03.974
<v Speaker 1>the outside and yet slice and it's red </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle and get a hunk of fat in </v>

3302
02:21:06.531 --> 02:21:07.364
<v Speaker 1>your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much better tasting than Philemon </v>

3303
02:21:10.931 --> 02:21:11.764
<v Speaker 1>neon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I will not have blue cheese with a </v>

3304
02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:13.800
<v Speaker 1>ribeye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3305
02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say that,</v>

3306
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:17.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Pacific dining car and what they do,</v>

3307
02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:20.500
<v Speaker 1>but they make the most perfect related </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

3308
02:21:20.501 --> 02:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like nothing on it.</v>

3309
02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:22.693
<v Speaker 1>It's just just the steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is like the most flavor complex </v>

3310
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:29.780
<v Speaker 1>piece of meat to the downtown one or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's downtown one.</v>

3311
02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.640
<v Speaker 1>See the downtown one is like 24 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

3312
02:21:31.641 --> 02:21:32.474
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3313
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:33.343
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get a steak at Pacific dining car </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll take super old school steakhouse.</v>

3329
02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:05.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that like </v>

3330
02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:08.480
<v Speaker 1>when they have a relationship with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

3331
02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:09.433
<v Speaker 1>with the cattle farm or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say I am excited about a </v>

3332
02:22:12.561 --> 02:22:13.610
<v Speaker 1>grown steak.</v>

3333

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you excited about something when </v>

3334
02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:18.270
<v Speaker 1>something doesn't have to die ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely safe.</v>

3335
02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Clipping taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it tastes as good as the original and</v>

3336
02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:22.101
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3337
02:22:22.101 --> 02:22:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love both of these.</v>

3338
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Then you would obviously I would choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that was just 100 percent.</v>

3339
02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3340
02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Just because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3341
02:22:30.530 --> 02:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>just an efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3342
02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the empathy,</v>

3343
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:34.603
<v Speaker 1>the emotional thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like even just for efficiency's </v>

3344
02:22:37.111 --> 02:22:38.170
<v Speaker 1>sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like about this,</v>

3345
02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the saving the environment from methane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>methane that.</v>

3346
02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:43.073
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we don't need cows </v>

3347
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:45.830
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to start marking those cows.</v>

3348
02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I know I fucked and just grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be like,</v>

3349
02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:50.700
<v Speaker 1>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3350
02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:52.370
<v Speaker 1>dude online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

3351
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:53.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm a photo from his house in Long </v>
<v Speaker 1>Island and he was saying that long </v>

3352
02:22:57.811 --> 02:23:01.240
<v Speaker 1>island is just infested with deer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they literally going in and giving,</v>

3353
02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:04.890
<v Speaker 1>giving these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these deer operations and they're,</v>

3354
02:23:04.891 --> 02:23:05.870
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3355
02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:07.380
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to remove their ovaries.</v>

3356
02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:10.440
<v Speaker 1>They're giving them birth control pills </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying all these different ways.</v>

3357
02:23:10.470 --> 02:23:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these different proposals.</v>

3358
02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:15.390
<v Speaker 1>And even some places they hired snipers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're giving.</v>

3359
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.520
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to figure out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no predators and there's</v>

3360
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:20.820
<v Speaker 1>just a fucking astounding number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>

3361
02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:22.390
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3362
02:23:22.390 --> 02:23:23.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes.</v>

3363
02:23:23.310 --> 02:23:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just human civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we just,</v>

3364
02:23:25.051 --> 02:23:27.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a domino effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep like fucking sort of.</v>

3365
02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:29.520
<v Speaker 1>But the real issue is just no predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3366
02:23:29.521 --> 02:23:31.850
<v Speaker 1>if they really want to hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they released a bunch of wolves,</v>

3367
02:23:31.851 --> 02:23:33.770
<v Speaker 1>sure they take care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with.</v>

3368
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:34.663
<v Speaker 1>That was a human decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying that because </v>

3369
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:38.670
<v Speaker 1>those ecosystems work perfectly and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd come in and we're like,</v>

3370
02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't like those trees over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bird goes away and then like,</v>

3371
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.420
<v Speaker 1>that bird was responsible for this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that blah blah blah blah blah.</v>

3372
02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:47.820
<v Speaker 1>And then I don't like wolves eat my </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

3373
02:23:47.821 --> 02:23:48.654
<v Speaker 1>I hate wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way they have sharp </v>

3374
02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:52.650
<v Speaker 1>teeth out like it one bit and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>look very,</v>

3375
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:53.880
<v Speaker 1>very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3376
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.830
<v Speaker 1>So whatever the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

3377
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey with a perfect system.</v>

3379
02:24:00.470 --> 02:24:01.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you monkey with that perfect </v>

3380
02:24:02.431 --> 02:24:04.080
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you monkeyed it out,</v>

3381
02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:05.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible.</v>

3382
02:24:05.461 --> 02:24:07.740
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking deer everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3383
02:24:07.741 --> 02:24:10.410
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep your lending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you got to keep it running,</v>

3384
02:24:10.411 --> 02:24:11.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For people live around there.</v>

3385
02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:12.603
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge pain in the ass because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed into those things all the time </v>

3386
02:24:15.151 --> 02:24:20.151
<v Speaker 1>now and you could die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends at run into meese and a</v>

3387
02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 1>moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose is run into a tree.</v>

3388
02:24:23.850 --> 02:24:24.683
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tech stories of like some </v>

3389
02:24:26.821 --> 02:24:28.950
<v Speaker 1>guy who had a pickup truck was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>

3391

3394
02:24:39.201 --> 02:24:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it walked away.</v>

3395
02:24:41.281 --> 02:24:42.114
<v Speaker 1>It'll probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully he'll see the video on </v>

3396
02:24:44.461 --> 02:24:45.294
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very recently of a guy hitting a moose </v>

3397
02:24:47.131 --> 02:24:49.920
<v Speaker 1>on the highway in Canada and it launches</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into the air.</v>

3398
02:24:50.130 --> 02:24:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean launches it like the Musha steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the road and I'm boom,</v>

3399
02:24:54.211 --> 02:24:56.160

<v Speaker 1>people that are filming,</v>

3400
02:24:56.161 --> 02:24:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

3402
02:25:03.841 --> 02:25:06.030
<v Speaker 1>30 feet through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to it?</v>

3403
02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a video that is.</v>

3404
02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It might not have man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3405
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it might have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so tough.</v>

3406
02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:15.360
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is right here.</v>

3407
02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:16.233
<v Speaker 1>Me Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough.</v>

3408
02:25:16.390 --> 02:25:19.800
<v Speaker 1>This guy's driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

3409
02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not alive.</v>

3410
02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:25.390
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a deer more than most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one that I saw honestly,</v>

3411
02:25:25.391 --> 02:25:26.224
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the same video from a </v>

3412
02:25:28.301 --> 02:25:29.920
<v Speaker 1>different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost.</v>

3413
02:25:30.370 --> 02:25:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3414
02:25:32.201 --> 02:25:33.340
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dead.</v>

3415
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:34.943
<v Speaker 1>He's just lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets scared and he's playing dead </v>

3416
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:39.190
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't want anybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was definitely dead.</v>

3417
02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely dead.</v>

3418
02:25:41.141 --> 02:25:41.974
<v Speaker 1>And that car is Jack my five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably totaled a caved in bent </v>

3419
02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:48.280
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just suck so bad.</v>

3420
02:25:48.490 --> 02:25:48.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3421
02:25:48.821 --> 02:25:51.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some place like in Idaho,</v>

3422
02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Montana where they have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpasses are those overpasses,</v>

3423
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:56.610
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty great to help the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals nature.</v>

3424
02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's so,</v>

3425
02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like so many things we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do.</v>

3426
02:26:00.611 --> 02:26:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's resource intensive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether people agree with it or not,</v>

3427
02:26:04.031 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but we could totally be in harmony with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things for guns.</v>

3428
02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:08.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't have time for that.</v>

3429
02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:10.980
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing that on our,</v>

3430
02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:14.860
<v Speaker 1>our Tuesday a project to do that on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one on one for mountain lions.</v>

3431
02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3432
02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should do.</v>

3433
02:26:16.721 --> 02:26:17.554
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the genetic diversity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions is threatened by the one </v>

3434
02:26:19.441 --> 02:26:23.320
<v Speaker 1>on one because there's mountain lions on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean side and they're like breeding</v>

3435
02:26:23.321 --> 02:26:24.970
<v Speaker 1>too much with the mountain lions over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3436
02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:26.763
<v Speaker 1>too hard for them to get across to </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] to find all the mountain </v>

3437
02:26:29.021 --> 02:26:34.021
<v Speaker 1>lions on this side as you go deep into </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm Simi Valley and those areas.</v>

3438
02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:39.190
<v Speaker 1>So apparently they're trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some way to mitigate that and one of</v>

3439
02:26:39.191 --> 02:26:40.024
<v Speaker 1>the best ideas is really wide strip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>land so these things feel comfortable </v>

3440
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:45.063
<v Speaker 1>and again to like pave it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're gonna like put dirt in </v>

3441
02:26:47.351 --> 02:26:49.300
<v Speaker 1>there and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those.</v>

3442
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 1>They look great too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shit load of money.</v>

3443
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:52.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what they need to do that </v>

3444
02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:54.380
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

3445
02:26:54.381 --> 02:26:56.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have enough shit humans already,</v>

3446
02:26:56.651 --> 02:27:01.120
<v Speaker 1>like even even some of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean minus mental problems,</v>

3447
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:06.340
<v Speaker 1>mental issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we have so much.</v>

3448
02:27:06.341 --> 02:27:07.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3449
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:08.770
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I was like,</v>

3450
02:27:08.771 --> 02:27:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was never like destitute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was definitely very,</v>

3451
02:27:11.081 --> 02:27:11.914
<v Speaker 1>very poor and wasn't sure if I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>make rent or had to borrow a lot of </v>

3452
02:27:15.161 --> 02:27:17.350
<v Speaker 1>money for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a few years and things like that.</v>

3453
02:27:18.570 --> 02:27:20.590
<v Speaker 1>But then you just realize how much you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

3454
02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean if your risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in comparison in comparison,</v>

3455
02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:24.634
<v Speaker 1>like I can always find water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could always find water and if I was </v>

3456
02:27:27.431 --> 02:27:31.180
<v Speaker 1>social enough I could definitely gain </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trust of people to be able to let me</v>

3457
02:27:31.181 --> 02:27:32.530
<v Speaker 1>crash for awhile on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

3458
02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:33.483
<v Speaker 1>on a couch.</v>

3459
02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So there was always a way to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if there are little things.</v>

3460
02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:38.493
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I bring that up is just </v>

3461
02:27:39.761 --> 02:27:42.830
<v Speaker 1>because like nature to kind of our job </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be stewards of,</v>

3462
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:45.250
<v Speaker 1>of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be better at it.</v>

3463
02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It certainly isn't a lot of ways we </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain Julie should be responsible.</v>

3464
02:27:48.731 --> 02:27:53.731
<v Speaker 1>That's why it should be so much more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big deal when something like some sort</v>

3465
02:27:53.801 --> 02:27:57.990
<v Speaker 1>of a company pollutes a bay or a no shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is.</v>

3466
02:27:58.350 --> 02:27:59.183
<v Speaker 1>It is such a giant deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't like gloss over it with a </v>

3467
02:28:01.571 --> 02:28:03.800
<v Speaker 1>clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you've done is like Devin,</v>

3468
02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:06.670
<v Speaker 1>like that whole thing that happened with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bp and the oil spill in the Gulf.</v>

3469
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Like they devastated an entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

3470
02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean that all the people that relied </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that area for fishing,</v>

3471
02:28:13.650 --> 02:28:14.483
<v Speaker 1>all that and then the people that live </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby and then the people that had a </v>

3472
02:28:16.901 --> 02:28:19.990
<v Speaker 1>clean it apparently the people that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean up their own brain cancer.</v>

3473
02:28:21.070 --> 02:28:22.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Bueno.</v>

3474
02:28:22.330 --> 02:28:25.220
<v Speaker 1>You've got to clean up gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spill oil spill all day.</v>

3475
02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:27.590
<v Speaker 1>That should be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you breathing that in?</v>

3476
02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you got over your face?</v>

3477
02:28:30.141 --> 02:28:30.974
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them fucking three m,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three m mask and then paper masks that </v>

3478
02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:35.714
<v Speaker 1>should be sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely is going to filter out all </v>

3479
02:28:37.401 --> 02:28:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the toxins that are going to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your DNA.</v>

3480
02:28:39.350 --> 02:28:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So terrible man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3481
02:28:41.841 --> 02:28:42.674
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much of deep water horizon oil spill </v>

3482
02:28:44.601 --> 02:28:47.000
<v Speaker 1>is disappeared because of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's good.</v>

3483
02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Well they were eating microbes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they?</v>

3484
02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They poured that on there,</v>

3485
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:51.383
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They was like one of the thing that's </v>

3486
02:28:52.311 --> 02:28:55.100
<v Speaker 1>some new shit they're going to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually for plastic as well.</v>

3487
02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Chemicals used to disperse it to kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>

3488
02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Making it more available to the microbes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that live in the deeper portions,</v>

3489
02:29:02.061 --> 02:29:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up with all those facebook things</v>

3490
02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:04.750
<v Speaker 1>like right in front of it.</v>

3491
02:29:04.930 --> 02:29:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It just like an issue with the a website</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Shitty shitty coding.</v>

3492
02:29:09.411 --> 02:29:11.870
<v Speaker 1>CNBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>

3493
02:29:11.871 --> 02:29:12.860
<v Speaker 1>You've seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see.</v>

3494
02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:14.293
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love when someone super smart </v>

3495
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:19.760
<v Speaker 1>figures out a giant issues we have with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something simple.</v>

3496
02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No microbes.</v>

3497
02:29:20.931 --> 02:29:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Microbes can make oil or fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fungus.</v>

3498
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Fungus is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fungus gets rid of oil,</v>

3499
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:26.533
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile those microbes are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get eaten by fish and those fish are </v>

3500
02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:32.630
<v Speaker 1>going to become huge and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start thinking through and they go,</v>

3501
02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of these motherfuckers coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and killing us.</v>

3502
02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:37.010
<v Speaker 1>We got to go out there and kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

3503
02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they tried to really fuck with</v>

3504
02:29:41.301 --> 02:29:42.290
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>

3505
02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:43.273
<v Speaker 1>If there's like a new blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to war with the fish and feel good </v>

3506
02:29:45.051 --> 02:29:46.340
<v Speaker 1>about eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

3507
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:48.830
<v Speaker 1>What does this bacteria are evolving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat?</v>

3508
02:29:48.831 --> 02:29:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Plastic we dump into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3509
02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Through evolving to do it without us </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

3510
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:55.423
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make an alien man like </v>

3511
02:29:57.081 --> 02:29:59.840
<v Speaker 1>the movie alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guard Geiger Alien.</v>

3512
02:29:59.930 --> 02:30:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean the xenomorph more?</v>

3513
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3514
02:30:02.801 --> 02:30:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3515
02:30:04.050 --> 02:30:04.883
<v Speaker 1>I posted this thing on instagram a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days ago that I saw from </v>

3516
02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:09.470
<v Speaker 1>nature is metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the instagram account,</v>

3517
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:10.543
<v Speaker 1>and it's a cuddle fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen how cuddle fish </v>

3518
02:30:12.021 --> 02:30:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Jack's other fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3519
02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Spirit watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even seem real.</v>

3520
02:30:17.390 --> 02:30:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

3521
02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:22.693
<v Speaker 1>It's like an underwater frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way it opens up like a flower </v>

3522
02:30:26.001 --> 02:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and put this thing into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is incredible at it.</v>

3523
02:30:28.851 --> 02:30:29.684
<v Speaker 1>Stabs it and then it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a great system because it's </v>

3524
02:30:33.641 --> 02:30:36.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps it close to stay in camouflage.</v>

3525
02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:37.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it only opens it last second </v>

3526
02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:44.740
<v Speaker 1>and probably maybe the color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesmer as the CND and enemies.</v>

3527
02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It literally takes on the shape and </v>
<v Speaker 1>texture of the sea and enemies.</v>

3528
02:30:50.090 --> 02:30:51.050
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3529
02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:53.630
<v Speaker 1>the amount of camouflaged it has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

3530
02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:56.210
<v Speaker 1>There's somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess related to octopus,</v>

3531
02:30:56.540 --> 02:30:57.373
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which many of the activists can do the </v>

3532
02:30:58.281 --> 02:30:58.990
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3533
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3534
02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:01.520
<v Speaker 1>The change gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camouflage thing is insane.</v>

3535
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean nature is like way more advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we'll ever that.</v>

3536
02:31:04.050 --> 02:31:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean what we are in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

3537
02:31:06.470 --> 02:31:09.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like from our point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

3538
02:31:09.201 --> 02:31:10.034
<v Speaker 1>looking at nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just like an evolution of its </v>

3539
02:31:12.850 --> 02:31:13.450
<v Speaker 1>molecular.</v>

3540
02:31:13.450 --> 02:31:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile the octopus is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you complaining about?</v>

3541
02:31:16.911 --> 02:31:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a phone.</v>

3542
02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fly on a plane.</v>

3543
02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:23.220
<v Speaker 1>You're pitching that you can't turn into</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you look like a coral reef.</v>

3544
02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:24.473
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a cuddle fish right there </v>

3545
02:31:25.381 --> 02:31:29.190
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be a coral reef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mine isn't crab crab.</v>

3546
02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:32.230
<v Speaker 1>What are they feeding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A crab grass.</v>

3547
02:31:32.310 --> 02:31:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucker.</v>

3548
02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:36.453
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird look and freaky alien </v>

3549
02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:41.750
<v Speaker 1>creature and I love it's propulsion </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is great.</v>

3550
02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Just undulates signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

3551
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:47.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3552
02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I love the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also really love spiders.</v>

3553
02:31:50.170 --> 02:31:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Spiders or just to king of camouflage </v>
<v Speaker 1>played that video,</v>

3554
02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:57.030
<v Speaker 1>that king of camouflage the cuttlefish </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cuddly looking.</v>

3555
02:31:57.210 --> 02:31:59.860
<v Speaker 1>They do have like a little smile to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these cute guys.</v>

3556
02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:03.320
<v Speaker 1>They mean the same kind of cuddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cuddle with a Ct.</v>

3557
02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:04.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3558
02:32:04.170 --> 02:32:05.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what they meaNt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they meant.</v>

3559
02:32:06.810 --> 02:32:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Look at how it just becomes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's near.</v>

3560
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when it sits down on stuff yet it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so complicated.</v>

3561
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:17.150
<v Speaker 1>It looks like other fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3562
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:19.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a octopus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3563
02:32:19.310 --> 02:32:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Like look at this octopus as it's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground in cephalopod.</v>

3564
02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:25.920
<v Speaker 1>These things are just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've adapted so cool.</v>

3565
02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:30.950
<v Speaker 1>A way to fake it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just so alien to us.</v>

3566
02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3567
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:33.663
<v Speaker 1>look crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how it looks like the bottom of </v>

3568
02:32:36.901 --> 02:32:37.734
<v Speaker 1>that thing that it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks more like I'm cooler than </v>

3569
02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:44.260
<v Speaker 1>octopus face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knoW,</v>

3570
02:32:44.490 --> 02:32:47.400
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about before about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of aliens visiting us.</v>

3571
02:32:47.401 --> 02:32:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Like why would we think that they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like us at all?</v>

3572
02:32:50.730 --> 02:32:51.563
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3573
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3574
02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:56.100
<v Speaker 1>they could just be spheres of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>period and they're just like,</v>

3575
02:32:56.101 --> 02:32:56.970
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

3576
02:32:57.260 --> 02:33:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Why do they have to have a language even</v>
<v Speaker 1>convey intent?</v>

3577
02:33:00.330 --> 02:33:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I liked,</v>

3578
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:02.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that movie that came out </v>

3579
02:33:02.370 --> 02:33:04.740
<v Speaker 1>recently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alien.</v>

3580
02:33:04.741 --> 02:33:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3581
02:33:05.221 --> 02:33:07.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one up with the one that memory one,</v>

3582
02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:09.313
<v Speaker 1>which I wrote off at first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I went back and watched it and </v>

3583
02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:13.230
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty fucking what's it caLled </v>
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>

3584
02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Because I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember jeremy renner.</v>

3585
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:19.110
<v Speaker 1>That guy stepped upon arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrival.</v>

3586
02:33:19.111 --> 02:33:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that.</v>

3588
02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>

3589
02:33:23.130 --> 02:33:24.750
<v Speaker 1>first sought when the girl died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3590
02:33:24.751 --> 02:33:26.580
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get me with this.</v>

3591
02:33:27.010 --> 02:33:27.691
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3592
02:33:27.691 --> 02:33:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3593
02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:29.910
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3594
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:31.320
<v Speaker 1>that changed real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3595
02:33:31.321 --> 02:33:33.110
<v Speaker 1>it was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

3596
02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:36.240
<v Speaker 1>and they were something totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

3597
02:33:36.330 --> 02:33:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3598
02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:38.520
<v Speaker 1>The way I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3599
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:39.743
<v Speaker 1>why would we assume that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be physical when we have things </v>

3600
02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:43.074
<v Speaker 1>like wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have like literally all of the </v>

3601
02:33:45.691 --> 02:33:50.691
<v Speaker 1>world's data coming to you on your phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>from space with zero connection.</v>

3602
02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:53.310
<v Speaker 1>You take that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spin that phone around,</v>

3603
02:33:53.430 --> 02:33:54.263
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing physical connecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why wouldn't we assume that </v>

3604
02:33:56.791 --> 02:34:00.510
<v Speaker 1>information travels from alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alien like that?</v>

3605
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Why do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they need a language?</v>

3606
02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:03.413
<v Speaker 1>Do they need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they need to be able to touch </v>

3607
02:34:05.551 --> 02:34:08.010
<v Speaker 1>things and see things and feel things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3608
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:10.830
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be information that might be an</v>

3609
02:34:10.831 --> 02:34:12.130
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

3610
02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when people talk about doing dmt or</v>

3611
02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:16.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or uh,</v>

3612
02:34:16.290 --> 02:34:17.123
<v Speaker 1>or even ketamine know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that kind of dissociative </v>

3613
02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:20.063
<v Speaker 1>intelligences that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence has been lobbying on </v>

3614
02:34:23.481 --> 02:34:24.301
<v Speaker 1>dissociated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like that.</v>

3615
02:34:24.301 --> 02:34:27.880
<v Speaker 1>They feel around them like almost an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight and like intelligence.</v>

3616
02:34:28.570 --> 02:34:30.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everything is just pure content.</v>

3617
02:34:30.731 --> 02:34:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just everything is consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you all the time,</v>

3618
02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:35.860
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible.</v>

3619
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:36.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3620
02:34:36.551 --> 02:34:37.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's what you are.</v>

3621
02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:39.270
<v Speaker 1>So all we are is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3622
02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:41.850
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know are vibrating weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>

3623
02:34:41.851 --> 02:34:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we just don't have the senses to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with whatever the fuck else is around.</v>

3624
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:49.570
<v Speaker 1>We have to deal with all our biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>

3625
02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:50.473
<v Speaker 1>all of our imperatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we need to concentrate on in order </v>

3626
02:34:52.301 --> 02:34:57.301
<v Speaker 1>to stay functional as a flesh bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at division of consciousness.</v>

3627
02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:00.670
<v Speaker 1>We're literally lifeforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are forms of life.</v>

3628
02:35:00.700 --> 02:35:01.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body literally is an avatar for </v>

3629
02:35:02.591 --> 02:35:03.850
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3630
02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:05.063
<v Speaker 1>Movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I call the biomechanical </v>

3631
02:35:07.151 --> 02:35:10.030
<v Speaker 1>consciousness transport system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good name for it.</v>

3632
02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:11.083
<v Speaker 1>You want to talk to chicks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do is we're just going to </v>

3633
02:35:13.571 --> 02:35:16.990
<v Speaker 1>get in the hot tub with our biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transport,</v>

3634
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:21.880
<v Speaker 1>so containment vehicles whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever something deal to hot tub.</v>

3635

<v Speaker 1>a way.</v>

3651
02:35:55.470 --> 02:35:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming to change,</v>

3652
02:35:57.671 --> 02:35:59.580
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come and issue a strange man.</v>

3653
02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:07.720
<v Speaker 1>The guy guy debord on your shirt who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide to board to board.</v>

3654
02:36:10.390 --> 02:36:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started.</v>

3655
02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

3656
02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:16.600
<v Speaker 1>It's the guy who started the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situationists.</v>

3657
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:17.493
<v Speaker 3>They were kind of like a philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>artistic movement in the fifties in </v>

3658
02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:26.720
<v Speaker 3>french.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they got a basically credit.</v>

3659
02:36:26.730 --> 02:36:27.563
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of like data ism mixed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some different artists like </v>

3660
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.823
<v Speaker 3>artistic techniques and some philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would do these exercises to </v>

3661
02:36:35.741 --> 02:36:39.970
<v Speaker 3>kind of shake their orientation like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they love disorientation.</v>

3662
02:36:39.971 --> 02:36:40.960
<v Speaker 3>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3663
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:41.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink a bunch of absent and walk around </v>

3664
02:36:44.141 --> 02:36:46.900
<v Speaker 3>their town light and act like a group of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them would like,</v>

3665
02:36:46.901 --> 02:36:49.780
<v Speaker 3>act like they were tourists in their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>town and they would look.</v>

3666
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:53.950
<v Speaker 3>They would navigate by looking up at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings as opposed to a street level.</v>

3667
02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:56.050
<v Speaker 3>So they would do things like that or </v>
<v Speaker 3>take maps,</v>

3668
02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:59.920
<v Speaker 3>tourist maps of other cities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>superimpose them block for block,</v>

3669
02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:03.850
<v Speaker 3>like on another city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they did jokes like we are,</v>

3670
02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:04.693
<v Speaker 3>we're like kind of bits where one guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed as a bishop and actually lead a </v>

3671
02:37:08.351 --> 02:37:12.070
<v Speaker 3>sermon at a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a notre dam and a</v>

3672
02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.900
<v Speaker 1>don't ever say that again,</v>

3673
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 3>frank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like pranksters.</v>

3674
02:37:19.491 --> 02:37:20.324
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like sticky notes with them </v>

3675
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.020
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were credited.</v>

3676

3711
02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:50.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first,</v>

3712
02:38:50.361 --> 02:38:52.100
<v Speaker 3>when I first moved to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3713
02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:53.233
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine and a performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>artist took me to this experimental </v>

3714
02:38:55.131 --> 02:38:58.790
<v Speaker 3>theater that was in a garage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>williamsburg like way back who was still</v>

3715
02:38:58.791 --> 02:38:59.624
<v Speaker 3>pretty shitty city cd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you walk into the garage and they </v>

3716
02:39:02.601 --> 02:39:05.730
<v Speaker 3>had this theater piece on [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>board and uh,</v>

3717
02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:07.243
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing as soon as it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they kind of explained what it </v>

3718
02:39:09.861 --> 02:39:11.510
<v Speaker 3>was about and the journey and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>

3719
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:14.480
<v Speaker 3>But it was also done in a style that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have been situation.</v>

3720
02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:15.333
<v Speaker 3>So we were just like on these boards </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're on top of buckets for seats </v>

3721
02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:21.020
<v Speaker 3>for bleachers.</v>

3722
02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:22.850
<v Speaker 3>And then they were passing around like </v>
<v Speaker 3>beers,</v>

3723
02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:23.773
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people were just drinking beers and </v>

3724
02:39:24.741 --> 02:39:25.574
<v Speaker 3>watching this play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was amazing and it really </v>

3725
02:39:28.461 --> 02:39:30.530
<v Speaker 3>inspired me where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3726
02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I dig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

3727
02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:33.020
<v Speaker 3>I liked that pranking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hacking,</v>

3728
02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:34.730
<v Speaker 3>social hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice.</v>

3729
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.863
<v Speaker 3>Provoked to the point of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violence for violence or annoying </v>

3730
02:39:40.551 --> 02:39:41.440
<v Speaker 3>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3731
02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BuT someone who's doing it on purpose,</v>

3732
02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:46.560
<v Speaker 3>which is even more annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super annoying.</v>

3733
02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.990
<v Speaker 3>More than just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3734
02:39:47.991 --> 02:39:49.370
<v Speaker 3>he's an annoying person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>

3735
02:39:49.371 --> 02:39:52.010
<v Speaker 3>this person's doing it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like andy kaufman,</v>

3736
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:53.810
<v Speaker 3>situationist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3737
02:39:54.140 --> 02:39:56.870
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't necessarily maybe have </v>
<v Speaker 3>described himself as that,</v>

3738
02:39:56.871 --> 02:39:58.430
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a perfect example of that.</v>

3739
02:39:58.431 --> 02:40:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Or andy warhol more kaufman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3740
02:40:01.761 --> 02:40:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Because warhol was just creating art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

3741
02:40:04.011 --> 02:40:04.844
<v Speaker 3>buT his whole like a con artist kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vibe whether he would have ascribed to </v>

3742
02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:11.720
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that he was kind of causing</v>

3743
02:40:11.721 --> 02:40:12.780
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3744
02:40:12.781 --> 02:40:16.140
<v Speaker 3>that handled the campbell soup soup </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign is a little bit of a con.</v>

3745
02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.810
<v Speaker 3>It was a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people enjoyed looking at it.</v>

3746
02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:20.580
<v Speaker 3>They did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it started.</v>

3747
02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:23.620
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like when I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3748
02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:24.473
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little bit of a con in the </v>

3749
02:40:26.221 --> 02:40:27.600
<v Speaker 3>factory idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3750
02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:29.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is also a little bit of a con.</v>

3751
02:40:29.761 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a hack.</v>

3752
02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a conscious,</v>

3753
02:40:32.610 --> 02:40:34.980
<v Speaker 3>really intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophical way.</v>

3754
02:40:35.330 --> 02:40:37.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not to say that he's really trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fool it.</v>

3755
02:40:37.641 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not that he's just like this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>

3756
02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:44.730
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

3757
02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:46.080
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I thought.</v>

3758
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:47.520
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3759
02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:52.630
<v Speaker 1>A little weird when like people push </v>
<v Speaker 1>back against someone trying to push what</v>

3760
02:40:52.701 --> 02:40:55.460
<v Speaker 1>they think is too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm like the,</v>

3761
02:40:55.461 --> 02:40:59.060
<v Speaker 1>they become these big cultural arguments</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to what's art and what's not.</v>

3762
02:40:59.061 --> 02:41:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Especially when things are funded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you remember piss christ?</v>

3763
02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't remember that.</v>

3764

<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

3770
02:41:18.291 --> 02:41:19.570
<v Speaker 1>that was one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a p,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there was another guy who was famous for</v>

3772
02:41:24.381 --> 02:41:26.930
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early nineties.</v>

3775
02:41:36.951 --> 02:41:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And it became a huge issue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were mad that it,</v>

3776
02:41:41.390 --> 02:41:44.990
<v Speaker 1>some of it was being funded and put up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in museums that were state funded.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like art works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3781
02:41:52.910 --> 02:41:56.030

<v Speaker 1>What piss christ was,</v>

3782
02:41:56.031 --> 02:41:56.864
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jar of pis with a crucifix in it and </v>

3783
02:41:59.061 --> 02:42:00.230

3789
02:42:14.281 --> 02:42:15.114
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of it is the audacity to just do </v>

3790
02:42:16.651 --> 02:42:19.110
<v Speaker 3>something like that and just be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool with it.</v>

3791
02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:20.273
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's my favorite art is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite moments and kind of </v>

3792
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:26.960
<v Speaker 3>discovering that was when I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit.</v>

3793
02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I was going to cornish college of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arts in seattle and uh,</v>

3794
02:42:30.810 --> 02:42:33.660
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was every tuesday or thursday</v>

3795
02:42:33.661 --> 02:42:36.450
<v Speaker 3>or maybe wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the middle days,</v>

3796
02:42:37.170 --> 02:42:38.003
<v Speaker 3>they would allow students to throw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>concert in the theater and the small </v>

3797
02:42:40.801 --> 02:42:41.634
<v Speaker 3>poncho hall theater and you could just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sign up for it and you can do whatever </v>

3798
02:42:43.831 --> 02:42:47.490
<v Speaker 3>you wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one day it was like all the kind of,</v>

3799
02:42:47.491 --> 02:42:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess I would call them performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>

3800
02:42:49.650 --> 02:42:52.560
<v Speaker 3>the musician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conceptual musician,</v>

3801
02:42:52.561 --> 02:42:54.090
<v Speaker 3>bad asses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all on stage.</v>

3802
02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:56.750
<v Speaker 3>And it was like brent arnold on cello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scott,</v>

3803
02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:57.593
<v Speaker 3>even kang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a on violin or viola and a guy on </v>

3804
02:43:01.801 --> 02:43:06.410
<v Speaker 3>base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like five or six people onstage,</v>

3805
02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:09.820
<v Speaker 3>all badasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim young and uh,</v>

3806
02:43:10.350 --> 02:43:15.350
<v Speaker 3>and I was in the theater and there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe 23 kids and a 60 seat theater</v>

3807
02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:18.840
<v Speaker 3>just like chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scattered throughout the seats.</v>

3808
02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:19.973
<v Speaker 3>And they started playing and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>was playing through distortion pedals </v>

3809
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:28.110
<v Speaker 3>and they just started playing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>distortion drones like all of them.</v>

3810
02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.530
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually it just sounded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3811
02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:34.150
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw people doing things on stage,</v>

3812
02:43:34.151 --> 02:43:35.140
<v Speaker 3>but all you could hear was</v>

3813
02:43:42.770 --> 02:43:47.250
<v Speaker 3>for like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably an hour and a.</v>

3814
02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:53.640
<v Speaker 3>And I had earplugs in and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleared out,</v>

3815
02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:57.020
<v Speaker 3>like everybody cleared out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hung to the end.</v>

3816
02:43:57.021 --> 02:43:57.854
<v Speaker 3>But I started like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started like head bobbing because as </v>

3817
02:44:01.551 --> 02:44:02.384
<v Speaker 3>soon as I started realizing that static,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're seeing visual static or </v>

3818
02:44:05.361 --> 02:44:06.194
<v Speaker 3>audio static,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a while you start to hallucinate </v>

3819
02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:11.300
<v Speaker 3>and you start to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start to hear music and static.</v>

3820
02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:14.470
<v Speaker 3>So if you hear eventually when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>defocus,</v>

3821
02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:15.410
<v Speaker 3>it's like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3822
02:44:15.411 --> 02:44:18.890
<v Speaker 3>those um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>magic I puzzles where you're supposed to</v>

3823
02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:21.170
<v Speaker 3>hold your thumb and then all of sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3824
02:44:21.171 --> 02:44:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I can see this three dimensional image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same exact concept essentially.</v>

3825
02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:25.573
<v Speaker 3>but your mind is creating the structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you metric structure because it </v>

3826
02:44:28.131 --> 02:44:31.400
<v Speaker 3>wants to find structure and static is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like raw energy.</v>

3827
02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:32.473
<v Speaker 3>So of like jodie foster in contact and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she would stare at the static trying to </v>

3828
02:44:35.541 --> 02:44:36.620
<v Speaker 3>find patterns in it.</v>

3829
02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

3830
02:44:38.181 --> 02:44:39.014
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3831
02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Similar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what.</v>

3832
02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:43.310
<v Speaker 3>So I started like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't stop,</v>

3833
02:44:43.311 --> 02:44:44.144
<v Speaker 3>like head headbanging essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was really slow and then </v>

3834
02:44:47.121 --> 02:44:49.610
<v Speaker 3>afterwards they came up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3835
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:50.743
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3836
02:44:50.810 --> 02:44:51.643
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just remember the bass player sayinG </v>

3837
02:44:54.291 --> 02:44:55.190
<v Speaker 3>that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3838
02:44:55.250 --> 02:44:56.360
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so cool.</v>

3839
02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:58.753
<v Speaker 3>Like he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have to explain anything at </v>

3840
02:44:59.931 --> 02:45:01.070
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a news thing.</v>

3841
02:45:01.071 --> 02:45:03.020
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I see duration pieces,</v>

3842
02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:06.050
<v Speaker 3>things that test people's patience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

3843
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:08.720
<v Speaker 3>I love seeing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand this.</v>

3844
02:45:08.721 --> 02:45:09.381
<v Speaker 3>And was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3845
02:45:09.381 --> 02:45:09.980
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3846
02:45:09.980 --> 02:45:10.780
<v Speaker 3>just hang in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3847
02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:12.800
<v Speaker 3>it can stay there or it's pissing people</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

3848
02:45:12.801 --> 02:45:13.634
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's or not even pissing </v>

3849
02:45:15.471 --> 02:45:17.840
<v Speaker 3>them off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just making them frustrated like there's</v>

3850
02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:21.920
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of frustration that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is fun to play with.</v>

3851
02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:23.660
<v Speaker 3>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least when I'm doing comedy.</v>

3852
02:45:23.661 --> 02:45:25.550
<v Speaker 3>A little bit of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is good.</v>

3853
02:45:25.551 --> 02:45:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Just like little doses here and there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of my thing.</v>

3854
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good feeling,</v>

3855
02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:33.980
<v Speaker 3>but I'm testing to see if people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to relax.</v>

3856
02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:35.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3857
02:45:35.061 --> 02:45:36.050
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just like,</v>

3858
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:37.063
<v Speaker 3>I'm just fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep that in mind when I'm doing </v>

3859
02:45:38.841 --> 02:45:42.590
<v Speaker 3>something that seems kind of frustrating</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you can keep both those things in</v>

3860
02:45:42.591 --> 02:45:43.424
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can relax and just go for the ride </v>

3861
02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.360
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want or you could just be like,</v>

3862
02:45:47.390 --> 02:45:49.370
<v Speaker 3>this fucking sucks and leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>

3863
02:45:49.371 --> 02:45:51.140
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not for.</v>

3864
02:45:51.141 --> 02:45:52.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

3865
02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3866
02:45:53.751 --> 02:45:57.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not all dependent upon whether or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not you're good at delivering the ride.</v>

3867
02:45:58.460 --> 02:45:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

3868
02:45:59.550 --> 02:46:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

3869
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:01.610
<v Speaker 3>as long as there's a reward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

3870
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:02.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3871
02:46:02.541 --> 02:46:04.820
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're doing right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always playing off of something.</v>

3872
02:46:04.821 --> 02:46:05.654
<v Speaker 3>That's what a joke is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like expectations of the </v>

3873
02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 3>expectation and and there's</v>

3874
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:12.230
<v Speaker 1>so many different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few different ways you can do that,</v>

3875
02:46:12.231 --> 02:46:15.290
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to be people that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>have different styles that they enjoy.</v>

3876
02:46:15.291 --> 02:46:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Like there's people that are gabriel </v>
<v Speaker 1>iglesias fans and people that tig notaro</v>

3877
02:46:20.001 --> 02:46:21.000
<v Speaker 1>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3878
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:23.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are fans of both.</v>

3879
02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:24.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

3880
02:46:24.621 --> 02:46:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

3881
02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I know I might go into those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those I'm like,</v>

3882
02:46:27.441 --> 02:46:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I like anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

3883
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3884
02:46:29.601 --> 02:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like any music.</v>

3885
02:46:30.711 --> 02:46:31.700
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3886
02:46:31.701 --> 02:46:33.050
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way to say.</v>

3887
02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Results may vary.</v>

3888
02:46:36.810 --> 02:46:38.210
<v Speaker 1>The results may vary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

3889
02:46:38.211 --> 02:46:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

3890
02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:40.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sincerity,</v>

3891
02:46:40.770 --> 02:46:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know is like comics.</v>

3892
02:46:42.501 --> 02:46:45.710
<v Speaker 1>If we're watching other comics up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we haven't seen before,</v>

3893
02:46:45.711 --> 02:46:49.670
<v Speaker 1>you can tell pretty quick when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming from an honest place.</v>

3894
02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's like they're a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

3895
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you can tell they're nervous and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of playing a cool front.</v>

3896
02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.033
<v Speaker 1>Like you can tell that the jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of view is coming from an </v>

3897
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:58.550
<v Speaker 1>honest place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3898
02:46:58.551 --> 02:47:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we lost that with djs.</v>

3899
02:47:02.820 --> 02:47:03.653
<v Speaker 1>There's chase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was a kid I would remember </v>

3900
02:47:06.411 --> 02:47:07.244
<v Speaker 1>djs playing songs and it was sincere </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for the songs they playing </v>

3901
02:47:11.011 --> 02:47:11.844
<v Speaker 1>because they did pick this song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want you to dig the song and </v>

3902
02:47:14.031 --> 02:47:17.650
<v Speaker 1>you'd find a dj that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really enjoyed his shell.</v>

3903
02:47:17.710 --> 02:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be three to seven.</v>

3904
02:47:19.411 --> 02:47:20.244
<v Speaker 1>This guy's the shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>album for a long time and then I'll </v>

3980
02:50:36.031 --> 02:50:39.660
<v Speaker 3>switch to another album or I'll switch </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like three songs off of a record.</v>

3981
02:50:39.661 --> 02:50:40.494
<v Speaker 3>But I like choosing when I'm listening </v>

3982
02:50:43.801 --> 02:50:45.690
<v Speaker 3>music by using the radio station.</v>

3990
02:50:57.511 --> 02:50:59.910
<v Speaker 3>school when it comes to music discovery </v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean the organic shit.</v>

3996
02:51:07.531 --> 02:51:09.990

<v Speaker 3>at technology,</v>

3997
02:51:09.991 --> 02:51:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like we're still kind of primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not organic enough.</v>

3998
02:51:12.721 --> 02:51:15.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not an after thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not an afterthought mode.</v>

3999

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4000
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:18.840
<v Speaker 3>technology should be like a light </v>
<v Speaker 3>switch.</v>

4001
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:19.703
<v Speaker 3>I went to a restaurant the other day and</v>

<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

4004
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:33.060
<v Speaker 3>We're touching wood and brick on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

4008
02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:42.000

<v Speaker 3>It makes them,</v>

4009
02:51:42.001 --> 02:51:45.090
<v Speaker 3>it reminds them of being human because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so digital most of the time.</v>

4010
02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Somebody gives you an ipad and the menus</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ipad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but if I go to a bar with a with a </v>

4020
02:52:10.691 --> 02:52:11.524
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it when I go into a bar that's </v>

4021
02:52:12.881 --> 02:52:14.130
<v Speaker 1>just a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

4022
02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:14.973
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I mean is there's no fucking </v>

4023
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:17.410
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's off.</v>

4024
02:52:17.530 --> 02:52:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just in case for an emergency </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcasts or something because there's.</v>

4025
02:52:20.170 --> 02:52:21.730
<v Speaker 1>There are peopLe gathered there </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

4026
02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:24.520
<v Speaker 1>but I like it when it's like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking monitor.</v>

4027
02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:26.970
<v Speaker 1>People are just chilling and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with each other.</v>

4028
02:52:26.980 --> 02:52:29.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what a bar should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I be afraid?</v>

4029
02:52:29.230 --> 02:52:30.063
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you show blade on every screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming 24 slash seven project it </v>

4030
02:52:35.470 --> 02:52:36.303
<v Speaker 1>projected on a screen just to soften the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light because otherwise you get that </v>

4031
02:52:38.831 --> 02:52:39.664
<v Speaker 1>screen glare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a fucking asshole on super old </v>

4032
02:52:42.071 --> 02:52:43.930
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drive a fucking horse.</v>

4033
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:44.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

4034
02:52:44.771 --> 02:52:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I do drive a horse.</v>

4035
02:52:46.830 --> 02:52:50.180
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the technical term for drive one.</v>

4036
02:52:50.470 --> 02:52:51.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to long for the days were </v>

4037
02:52:52.211 --> 02:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>engines were real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day we're going to be like,</v>

4038
02:52:54.530 --> 02:52:56.790
<v Speaker 1>remember when back when cars made noises</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could hear him.</v>

4039
02:52:56.791 --> 02:52:57.431
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4040
02:52:57.431 --> 02:52:58.750
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It be like.</v>

4041
02:52:58.751 --> 02:53:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he used to drive him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4042
02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:04.660
<v Speaker 1>that was my favorite scene in I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

4043
02:53:04.690 --> 02:53:05.523
<v Speaker 1>I'm going manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going like 300 miles per hour </v>

4044
02:53:07.001 --> 02:53:09.730
<v Speaker 1>and then the computer say or know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that the pastor said,</v>

4045
02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:10.593
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to switching to manual at these </v>

4046
02:53:11.891 --> 02:53:14.810
<v Speaker 1>speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that man.</v>

4047
02:53:15.230 --> 02:53:17.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be a thing of the past.</v>

4048
02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:18.820
<v Speaker 1>The spiritual wheels though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4049
02:53:18.821 --> 02:53:19.810
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was sick.</v>

4050
02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:20.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The car could rotate while it's still </v>

4051
02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:24.220
<v Speaker 1>maintaining the same speed forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

4052
02:53:24.221 --> 02:53:27.250
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just coming to spheres.</v>

4053
02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have them in factory.</v>

4054
02:53:28.570 --> 02:53:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Factory floor robots are like forklifts </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

4055
02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:31.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what they call that type of </v>

4056
02:53:34.151 --> 02:53:35.240
<v Speaker 1>steering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4057
02:53:35.650 --> 02:53:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's like crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically crab,</v>

4058
02:53:37.451 --> 02:53:39.970
<v Speaker 1>like so it can move forward sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>

4059
02:53:39.980 --> 02:53:40.813
<v Speaker 1>any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many years do you think we have </v>

4060
02:53:41.861 --> 02:53:43.420
<v Speaker 1>where it's still legal to drive your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>car?</v>

4061
02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I think we have prObably 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years.</v>

4062
02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds about right.</v>

4063
02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:48.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4064
02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:49.593
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's goiNg to creep in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are going to realize how much safer </v>

4065
02:53:52.181 --> 02:53:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with some.</v>

4066
02:53:53.530 --> 02:53:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Some assholes are gonna fuck up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>manual.</v>

4067
02:53:55.871 --> 02:53:56.704
<v Speaker 1>They're going to crash into a school or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and then people are </v>

4068
02:53:58.771 --> 02:54:00.640
<v Speaker 1>going to go enough with the manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4069
02:54:00.650 --> 02:54:01.411
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4070
02:54:01.411 --> 02:54:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'll do semI manual like you can,</v>

4071
02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can steer,</v>

4072
02:54:05.771 --> 02:54:06.604
<v Speaker 1>you can drive within certain parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the computer senses you're going </v>

4073
02:54:08.921 --> 02:54:11.800
<v Speaker 1>off the rails and we'll fucking guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car back.</v>

4074
02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:12.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4075
02:54:12.251 --> 02:54:13.084
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's such a demand for really old </v>

4076
02:54:16.121 --> 02:54:19.150
<v Speaker 1>cars that have tactile feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4077
02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.270
<v Speaker 1>They're so expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you buy a 19,</v>

4078
02:54:22.271 --> 02:54:23.104
<v Speaker 1>73 porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only like 150 200 horsepower </v>

4079
02:54:27.251 --> 02:54:29.350
<v Speaker 1>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If those things are in good shape.</v>

4080
02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worth a fuck load of money now.</v>

4081
02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:32.553
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you feel everything we drive in </v>

4082
02:54:34.031 --> 02:54:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4083
02:54:34.750 --> 02:54:35.583
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bumpy drive over you feel that </v>

4084
02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:38.553
<v Speaker 1>there's no power steering at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like turn on the steering </v>

4085
02:54:42.581 --> 02:54:43.181
<v Speaker 1>wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4086
02:54:43.181 --> 02:54:43.511
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4087
02:54:43.511 --> 02:54:44.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

4088
02:54:44.010 --> 02:54:44.843
<v Speaker 1>if you feel the force against the wheel </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and interpretation and when you turn </v>

4089
02:54:47.861 --> 02:54:50.440
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to turn way harder.</v>

4090
02:54:50.441 --> 02:54:50.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4091
02:54:50.921 --> 02:54:52.000
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to really.</v>

4092
02:54:52.001 --> 02:54:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be present with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like with new power steering,</v>

4093
02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you could kind of be absent minded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be taking a pretty hard corner.</v>

4094
02:54:58.790 --> 02:55:00.340
<v Speaker 1>She's easy to roll the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4095
02:55:00.341 --> 02:55:01.174
<v Speaker 1>difference in also the newest power </v>
<v Speaker 1>steering even opposed to the last </v>

4096
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:04.550
<v Speaker 1>generations</v>

4097
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:06.650
<v Speaker 3>now they do power steering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's electric.</v>

4098
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fly by wire.</v>

4099
02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:08.713
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the hydraulic gave you varying </v>

4100
02:55:11.151 --> 02:55:11.984
<v Speaker 3>feedback depending on how much a load </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on our rack and pinion and I always </v>

4101
02:55:15.351 --> 02:55:16.184
<v Speaker 3>loved writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that that was the perfect </v>

4102
02:55:17.361 --> 02:55:18.410
<v Speaker 3>happy medium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4103
02:55:18.530 --> 02:55:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Because it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well those really old cars were so light</v>

4104
02:55:22.010 --> 02:55:27.010
<v Speaker 3>like those old porsche's and old bmws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the bmw 2002 and by any bugs.</v>

4105
02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So light.</v>

4106
02:55:29.691 --> 02:55:31.750
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to have power steering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4107
02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4108
02:55:32.621 --> 02:55:34.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people are doing now is they're,</v>

4109
02:55:34.430 --> 02:55:35.121
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

4110
02:55:35.121 --> 02:55:35.954
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pulling the transmissions and </v>

4111
02:55:37.551 --> 02:55:39.410
<v Speaker 3>engines and replacing them with </v>
<v Speaker 3>electric,</v>

4112
02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:42.980
<v Speaker 3>so you still have the road feel and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>handling of it,</v>

4113
02:55:43.010 --> 02:55:44.300
<v Speaker 3>but you get the battery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the,</v>

4114
02:55:44.330 --> 02:55:46.460
<v Speaker 3>you get the battery so you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not loud,</v>

4115
02:55:46.461 --> 02:55:50.330
<v Speaker 3>but you get this great fusion of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got the classic car look,</v>

4116
02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:52.730
<v Speaker 3>but you've got the speed and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pickups.</v>

4117
02:55:52.730 --> 02:55:56.830
<v Speaker 3>So kind of like this little tiny bmt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bmw 2002 and you're doing zero,</v>

4118
02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:57.673
<v Speaker 3>63 point five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw somebody did that with a 1965 </v>

4119
02:56:01.101 --> 02:56:03.680
<v Speaker 3>mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took a 65 mustang and turns it into</v>

4120
02:56:03.681 --> 02:56:06.260
<v Speaker 3>an electric car and it was like to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sad.</v>

4121
02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:07.273
<v Speaker 3>It's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that when you're talking about </v>

4122
02:56:08.930 --> 02:56:09.763
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at this classic old </v>
<v Speaker 3>school muscle car and yet it has like a </v>

4123
02:56:13.490 --> 02:56:14.730
<v Speaker 3>tesla under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4124
02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:18.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like an electric muscle car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean rimac.</v>

4125
02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:19.313
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the rimac or rhythmic there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Estonian r I m a c and they make this a </v>

4126
02:56:27.241 --> 02:56:30.800
<v Speaker 3>electric car for electric motors motor </v>
<v Speaker 3>for each wheel.</v>

4127
02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got over a thousand horsepower.</v>

4128
02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:36.380
<v Speaker 3>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero to 60 in three point two.</v>

4129
02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:37.753
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three point is maybe even faster than </v>

4130
02:56:39.741 --> 02:56:41.500
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>M and a,</v>

4131
02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:41.970
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4132
02:56:41.970 --> 02:56:42.231
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4133
02:56:42.231 --> 02:56:42.471
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4134
02:56:42.471 --> 02:56:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Two point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point three.</v>

4135
02:56:45.130 --> 02:56:46.500
<v Speaker 3>That thing's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

4136
02:56:46.501 --> 02:56:48.980
<v Speaker 3>because my card is two point three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What car do you have?</v>

4137
02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:53.420
<v Speaker 3>A tesla p 100 d damn son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this thing.</v>

4138
02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:57.520
<v Speaker 3>This thing is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like one of those lexis copays,</v>

4139
02:56:57.530 --> 02:56:59.400
<v Speaker 3>those new lexus coops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4140
02:57:00.390 --> 02:57:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

4141
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if they can have like a.</v>

4142
02:57:04.251 --> 02:57:05.084
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

4143
02:57:05.490 --> 02:57:08.030
<v Speaker 3>That thing is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4144
02:57:08.031 --> 02:57:09.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

4145
02:57:09.711 --> 02:57:10.660
<v Speaker 3>And so it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4146
02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:12.290
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it definitely does.</v>

4147
02:57:12.291 --> 02:57:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>effectual steering and power.</v>

4148
02:57:16.270 --> 02:57:19.490
<v Speaker 3>This power distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it keeps things are gorgeous.</v>

4149
02:57:19.491 --> 02:57:20.324
<v Speaker 3>Can corner like a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because the computer's monitoring </v>

4150
02:57:23.421 --> 02:57:24.254
<v Speaker 3>traction all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if to each wheel with an electric motor </v>

4151
02:57:26.631 --> 02:57:27.464
<v Speaker 3>that has instantaneous torque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're able to steer the car with </v>

4152
02:57:30.081 --> 02:57:33.140
<v Speaker 3>acceleration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're coming around a corner,</v>

4153
02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:35.240
<v Speaker 3>depending on the mode and the way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're driving,</v>

4154
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:36.343
<v Speaker 3>you can actually push the car around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>corner with the wheels using the input </v>

4155
02:57:40.461 --> 02:57:41.294
<v Speaker 3>from the steering wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your directional steering but also </v>

4156
02:57:42.621 --> 02:57:47.621
<v Speaker 3>visual steering at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that car is disgusting.</v>

4157
02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:52.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just leaving this tesla behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just leaving it,</v>

4158
02:57:52.071 --> 02:57:53.780
<v Speaker 3>leaving it like it's parked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4159
02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:56.630
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy actually does some good shit.</v>

4160
02:57:56.660 --> 02:57:59.420
<v Speaker 3>And so there's like some like young rich</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that are always doing stuff,</v>

4161
02:57:59.421 --> 02:58:01.010
<v Speaker 3>but I like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to race a.</v>

4162
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:02.000
<v Speaker 3>All you</v>

4163
02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.710
<v Speaker 1>know is going to burry that ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ferrari is history.</v>

4164
02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that la ferrari?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4165
02:58:07.321 --> 02:58:09.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4166
02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:11.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a ferrari laferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hybrid.</v>

4167
02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:16.180
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The remax remax going to win.</v>

4168
02:58:16.430 --> 02:58:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

4169
02:58:18.210 --> 02:58:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

4170
02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:21.300
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one go.</v>

4171
02:58:22.230 --> 02:58:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Off the line.</v>

4172
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>

4173
02:58:26.750 --> 02:58:27.583
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you later.</v>

4174
02:58:28.210 --> 02:58:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It's linear power curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4175
02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:34.050
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a curve.</v>

4176
02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:36.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just a perfect curve of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>poWer.</v>

4177
02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:38.190
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4178
02:58:38.191 --> 02:58:40.710
<v Speaker 1>where does one get one of these remax </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

4179
02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:43.990
<v Speaker 1>How far can they drive a yards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4180
02:58:44.010 --> 02:58:47.010
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can go 200 feet per charge.</v>

4181
02:58:47.280 --> 02:58:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Find out how long those things drive for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4182
02:58:49.501 --> 02:58:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say they have 220 miles on them.</v>

4183
02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:54.033
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say I'm going to say 180 </v>

4184
02:58:57.301 --> 02:58:59.350
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred miles to 200 machines today.</v>

4185
02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:00.193
<v Speaker 1>You went low ball.</v>

4186
02:59:00.430 --> 02:59:02.910
<v Speaker 1>High ball on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Top top end of two.</v>

4187
02:59:02.911 --> 02:59:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which an electric car is a huge deal.</v>

4188
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:08.880
<v Speaker 1>What's your tesla get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the longest distance you drive?</v>

4189
02:59:09.650 --> 02:59:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Three 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty god damn good.</v>

4190
02:59:11.980 --> 02:59:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or three.</v>

4191
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:15.490
<v Speaker 1>You think about when tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they.</v>

4192
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like had a bunch of people.</v>

4193
02:59:17.131 --> 02:59:18.700
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two point eight.</v>

4194
02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:21.840
<v Speaker 1>80 two kilowatt can get 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five miles?</v>

4195
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:22.783
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they don't specify conceptual </v>

4196
02:59:23.960 --> 02:59:25.890
<v Speaker 1>driving to drive cycle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4197
02:59:25.891 --> 02:59:28.440
<v Speaker 1>So if you're driving like a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say 1:50.</v>

4198
02:59:28.510 --> 02:59:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not even,</v>

4199
02:59:29.671 --> 02:59:30.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4200
02:59:30.001 --> 02:59:31.410
<v Speaker 1>One 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me think about.</v>

4201
02:59:31.411 --> 02:59:32.244
<v Speaker 1>Like during the hurricane in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tesla released a bunch of these cars </v>

4202
02:59:36.720 --> 02:59:40.070
<v Speaker 1>that had um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had restrictions on the,</v>

4203
02:59:40.071 --> 02:59:42.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of distance they could drive.</v>

4204
02:59:43.050 --> 02:59:43.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they did it remotely and they </v>

4205
02:59:45.931 --> 02:59:48.660
<v Speaker 1>gave these cars more of a distance.</v>

4206
02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:49.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4207
02:59:49.171 --> 02:59:50.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They control speed.</v>

4208
02:59:50.401 --> 02:59:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Probably governed top to top speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4209
02:59:52.111 --> 02:59:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I think they actually literally have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold of hoW far they,</v>

4210
02:59:55.610 --> 02:59:57.900
<v Speaker 1>they like you could pay more when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy them.</v>

4211
02:59:58.470 --> 02:59:59.303
<v Speaker 1>If you buy one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have the option to have a 250 </v>

4212
03:00:01.711 --> 03:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>mile gas tank or a 350 miles a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just unlocked the capability.</v>

4213
03:00:06.061 --> 03:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4214
03:00:07.021 --> 03:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>So the same but kilowatt battery </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilowatt battery.</v>

4215
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

4216
03:00:11.311 --> 03:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

4217
03:00:12.391 --> 03:00:12.831
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4218
03:00:12.831 --> 03:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I think as long as the battery system Is</v>
<v Speaker 1>modular so that you can add or take away</v>

4219
03:00:16.501 --> 03:00:17.334
<v Speaker 1>from it without like huge manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs of changing the shape of the </v>

4220
03:00:20.071 --> 03:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

4221
03:00:20.990 --> 03:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>which is what tesla does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can either like elongate the body of</v>

4222
03:00:24.121 --> 03:00:24.954
<v Speaker 1>the car and then add more packs or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can shorten the body of the car and </v>

4223
03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>narrow it.</v>

4224
03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Less packs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it should just be packed.</v>

4225
03:00:31.150 --> 03:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking people over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have the capability.</v>

4226
03:00:34.891 --> 03:00:35.724
<v Speaker 1>It's just a software thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to cost any extra money </v>

4227
03:00:37.500 --> 03:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>unless the idea this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so weird.</v>

4228
03:00:39.901 --> 03:00:40.734
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then why not just make a </v>

4229
03:00:41.340 --> 03:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>competitive lease for the battery </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity that you want?</v>

4230
03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Or or they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4231
03:00:46.171 --> 03:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>why buy it for a small price now and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to pay more later we can unlock</v>

4232
03:00:50.461 --> 03:00:51.294
<v Speaker 1>more battery potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem instead of like say if you </v>

4233
03:00:53.011 --> 03:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>buy it engine and it has 800 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

4234
03:00:56.521 --> 03:00:57.354
<v Speaker 1>you know there's another option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could buy the v six and that only </v>

4235
03:00:59.141 --> 03:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>has 350 horsepower psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're kidding.</v>

4236
03:01:01.601 --> 03:01:02.434
<v Speaker 1>The v six has 800 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to let you use it </v>

4237
03:01:04.271 --> 03:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>because you're not paying us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what really what it is,</v>

4238
03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>is because it's the same exact battery </v>
<v Speaker 1>pack that I don't like the,</v>

4239
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't like,</v>

4240
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make sense.</v>

4241
03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Give intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've crippled some of their cars and </v>

4242
03:01:16.841 --> 03:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>the other ones they given you an option </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not crippled,</v>

4243
03:01:19.201 --> 03:01:20.034
<v Speaker 1>but we want you to pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you need to have the same exact </v>

4244
03:01:22.151 --> 03:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

4245
03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>it's an inept purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it is kinda,</v>

4246
03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4247
03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>it's way different because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about like a physical.</v>

4248
03:01:29.501 --> 03:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost if your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have to pay more on your phone is</v>

4249
03:01:32.741 --> 03:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>250 gigabytes versus 100?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

4250
03:01:35.380 --> 03:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4251
03:01:36.410 --> 03:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's like also the same as getting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>video game and you're like,</v>

4252
03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I've got the video game and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4253
03:01:40.481 --> 03:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>would you like to unlock more content?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see that's the journey you're on,</v>

4254
03:01:43.511 --> 03:01:44.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your video game is a portal to a </v>

4255
03:01:45.161 --> 03:01:45.994
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This physical device that has the </v>

4256
03:01:47.861 --> 03:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>capability tO drive 350 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4257
03:01:49.751 --> 03:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have those 3:50.</v>

4258
03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 miles.</v>

4259
03:01:53.420 --> 03:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>How long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times?</v>

4260
03:01:54.470 --> 03:01:55.303
<v Speaker 1>Like realistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only driving like maybe 30 miles a </v>

4261
03:01:58.091 --> 03:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't matter,</v>

4262
03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying that if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go across country,</v>

4263
03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>the idea was like you could in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

4264
03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT doesn't make sense.</v>

4265
03:02:05.201 --> 03:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real thing?</v>

4266
03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid just doesn't make any sense.</v>

4267
03:02:10.390 --> 03:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't need to do that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money.</v>

4268
03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:13.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you just want to like unify </v>

4269
03:02:14.921 --> 03:02:15.754
<v Speaker 1>the manufacturing process so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can create a higher yield or something </v>

4270
03:02:18.401 --> 03:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at it like the man,</v>
