1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
All this shit

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.900
for three e two one

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.480
pow Louis Gomez.
We are live,

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.070
we are live connected through the interwebs and through a network of Comedians,

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.920
Louis Gomez loose j Gomez who is Jayco mass.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.390
What do you like the j cause go Google Louis Gomez and watch how many baseball

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.980
players,
uh,

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.990
fucking just that's a problem making people use the J.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.490
It's very pretentious for garlic.
Yeah,
I agree.
No,
it is.
I understand you have to,

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.070
but it's almost like,
well,

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.230
it's almost ironic because I'm such a piece of garbage,

12
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:44.940
so I would have like a middle initial like,
um,
right.
Like you're like a luminary.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.470
Yeah.
Some important,
some important intellectual.
Yeah,
it is.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.570
But yeah,
it does.
It separates me as well.
But I almost feel like I,

15
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.270
I've made it a joke at this point.
They're correct.

16
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.750
Everyone that doesn't say the j.
So if I didn't correct you,
oh,
I see.

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.560
I wouldn't be being true to myself.
I understand.
So Louis J.
Gomez.
Thank you.

18
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
I feel like,
um,
you know,
we've talked about this ad nauseum on the podcast,

19
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.160
but I think this is one of the most unique times for,
uh,

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.730
like networks of comedians that were all connected together the way that we

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.610
weren't really before.

22
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.390
It was always like east coast versus West Coast for some stupid fucking reason.

23
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.980
There was always this debate where the best comics or from the style of comedy,

24
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.350
but that Shit seems to be out the window.
The Internet,

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.400
the best comics Naper gods.
He lives in fucking Tennessee.
Who's that?

26
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.710
He's a great comic cause he clean,
squeaky clean.

27
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.580
My Son's godfather just at a Netflix special.
Uh,
how do you spell his last name?

28
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.650
I'll be a r,
g.
A.
T.
Z.

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.790
E brilliant comic and Tz Eight.
He's,
he,
he,

30
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.260
but he grew up in Tennessee and he was like,
dude,

31
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.480
I don't want to live in New York or la.
Good for him.

32
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.550
Big House for $300,000 a fucking mansion.
Get ready for the zombies.

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.730
Yes,
zombies.
You want to live in that house.

34
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:58.200
Like that old dude and his daughter did going to live out there and have a

35
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.070
fucking perimeter protected.
Yeah.
Guys like Stan Hope.
He hasn't been La.

36
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.960
It was going to Bisbee for 12 years now that psychopath rip to stand helps dogs

37
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.440
now help bird his dog.
Yesterday did a big thing on social media about it.

38
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.250
Very touching,
very touching.
They put their dog down.
Sad.

39
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
I went through that last year with two dogs.
They're both couldn't walk anymore.

40
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.880
I mean,
I held on as long as I can,

41
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:25.740
but I had to carry my dog in and out of the house.
I had to carry him to eat.

42
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.980
I'd carry him outside and go,
it needs 140 pounds.
It was just,
it was well,

43
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.230
why couldn't they walk?
He was old.
A lot of leg locks.

44
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.240
I feel like the dog should have some good defense.

45
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.190
Wants to protect my fucking house.
Fuck.
Oh God,

46
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.670
no.
He's just big dog.
It's really old.

47
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:48.730
He was 13 which is super old for a massive oh yeah.
Those are huge dog.

48
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.690
Really old from it.
He said what's called a regency massive,
which is,

49
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.730
he was a part Neapolitan mastiff and part pit bull with a guy who,

50
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.980
my friend Joe who raised them and bred,
he

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 1>bred out all of the animal aggression.</v>

52
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.550
So you wouldn't let any dogs breed if they were aggressive towards people or

53
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.960
they're aggressive towards other dogs.

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.740
So what you get is this super chill massive dog.
Oh Wow.

55
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.070
Who's the athletic,
like there was small for a,

56
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.250
like a massive is like they can go like 200 plus pounds,

57
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.870
but those dogs are not very athletic.
They don't move very good.
Right.

58
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.940
It was a mix.
So any sort of like 140 they're like fucking running back.

59
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.210
<v 2>I got a kid.
So I have,</v>

60
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300
I have a hard time bringing beasts into my home that can kill a child very wise.

61
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.850
And you,
and it's sad and I'm not one of these anti pitbull people,

62
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.050
but I do understand when you see it,
you know,
you see irresponsible owners,

63
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:43.790
not the dog.
You have an asshole,

64
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.080
some fucking kid who doesn't know how to train a pit bull the proper way at an

65
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:52.040
animal that can literally kill somebody.
Um,
and you,
you know,
you see them,

66
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.250
you know the mall children,
and they,
you know,
and it's a sad,

67
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.940
it's such a sad thing.
So I get terrified anytime I see my dope,
my kid,

68
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:02.000
I walked the streets in New York City with him.
I live at Harlem,
so it's,

69
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:02.570
you know,

70
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.270
every other block is like the hood and then it's nice and then it's the hood.

71
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.070
And,
uh,
he was working so weird.
Yeah,
I figured out how to do that.
Yeah.
It's,

72
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.300
you know,
it's,
that's what they call gentrification,
right?
SORTA.
I mean,

73
00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:17.510
I guess this is more of racially,
uh,
they're talking with gentrification,

74
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:21.770
sort of a,
I think it's like a class thing because I grew up in a really shitty,

75
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.470
I grew up in the suburbs,
but very poor welfare section eight.

76
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.070
And kids in the city though,
when they grow up poor,

77
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.920
they're like on the next block there's like a millionaire or they're on the

78
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:33.980
subway and there's some fucking dude is going to Wall Street and you know,
he's,

79
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:36.950
he,
they're just constantly around an energy of success,

80
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.220
which is a very different thing when you go to the suburbs or rural areas.

81
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.720
It's a depressing,
nobody's striving to even get out.
Really.

82
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.130
<v 1>No,
that's a very good point,
right?</v>

83
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.310
Like you get to be truly integrated in New York City where La is missing that

84
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.490
Ellie's missing that in a big way.
La,
you have retrieval and poor people,

85
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.200
you know,
they're separated by cars.
Yeah,
they're separated.

86
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.640
<v 2>You can't hang out.
You have to be in that social circle.
You have to,</v>

87
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.030
cause people always debate like,
oh,
what Scott,

88
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.410
who's got hotter checks in New York or la and the answer's ally,
but in New York,

89
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.200
you're going to see them in New York.
Like you walked down the street.

90
00:05:12.201 --> 00:05:13.880
Me and Ari did a,

91
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:17.600
he does a podcast every year called happy booby day and we did it last year at

92
00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:20.660
the Legion of skanks and all it is happy booby day.
It's today,

93
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:25.010
to be honest with you,
it's the,
for the first like days of spring,

94
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.630
usually end of March,
beginning of April.

95
00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:30.440
And it's the first day that girls were like mini skirts out and their tits or

96
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:34.460
just hanging out and we literally just walked through the streets following hot

97
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:37.430
chicks comment that it was the most,
I mean you literally,
I don't even know.

98
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.850
I don't even know how we have careers at all.
Like we did this a year ago,

99
00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:45.590
this isn't fucking 20 years ago.
But uh,
yeah you,

100
00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:47.750
but you get to see them,
you get to interact with them and ally,

101
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:50.240
you're not interacting with a crazy hot model unless you know the right people.

102
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.950
You'd have to be standing somewhere where they go.
Right.
Cause like in La

103
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.120
<v 1>you wanted to meet,
you'd have run a casting agency.</v>

104
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.200
<v 0>That's what I have to do.
That's why those guys started that shit.</v>

105
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.760
That's why they did that.

106
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.300
How many people went into the business just so the meet girls just to get pussy,

107
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.910
like 30% of them.
That whole Motley Crue movie,

108
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.290
they s they are unapologetic about it.
Yeah,
they're unapologetic.
They're like,
uh,

109
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.850
yeah,
we,
we did this mic.
Maurice was like,
if it wasn't for groupies,

110
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.720
especially in a real interview,
if it wasn't for groupies,

111
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.450
I wouldn't even becoming a musician.
Yeah.

112
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.090
I mean people would criticize that like,
oh it's so gross.

113
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:27.530
It should be real artist was.
That is a crazy life.

114
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.220
You do not understand.
No one understands.
I don't understand.
There's no fucking,

115
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:32.390
like we had David Lee Roth in here.

116
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.740
There is no fucking way any of us will ever understand what it was like to be

117
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:41.720
David Lee Roth.
It is not humanly possible.
He is not pot and to be,

118
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.660
to come out the other end is fucking cool as that guy is like,

119
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.700
how the hell did that happen to not be,

120
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.640
I feel like I'm dying and I don't party at all really.

121
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.550
Like I drank a little bit and I feel like everyday I'm like,
is that my liver?

122
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:54.260
I don't even know what my remember is on my body.
I swear to God,

123
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.030
I couldn't point to my liver on my back.
Okay.

124
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:59.060
If you're standing in an orthodox stance and someone hits you with a left hook

125
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:02.900
to the body,
that's where your liver is.
That's why guys drop right here.
Yup.

126
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.590
It's right under your ribs.
Okay,
so when you punch somebody in the liver,

127
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.090
a lot of guys mistakenly go below the ribs.
Yeah.

128
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.650
You'd want to go right with the floating ribs,
bounces into the,
yeah.

129
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.690
If you watched like Shannon,
the Canon Briggs,
shout out to the champ.
Oh,

130
00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:23.000
look at David Ruffin,
that picture.
Oh,
gotta.
Come on,
man.

131
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:26.510
Nobody lives like that.
That guy was on top of the goddamn world.

132
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:29.330
It was built like a Greek God.
He could do the full splits.

133
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.060
The fucking wheel kicks on stage and Shit.

134
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.040
Unapologetic the level of sex this guy must've had.

135
00:07:39.181 --> 00:07:42.110
Oh my God.
Off the chart.
Oh my God.
It,
to be honest with you,

136
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.980
when I started comedy,

137
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.440
I started comedy wanting idolize and costs like that.
I grew up on 80s metal,

138
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.090
so I swear company 15 years ago.
It was literally a different time,

139
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:55.580
like you didn't really have to shy away from being like,
yeah,

140
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:58.570
I want to fuck after a show.
That wasn't a crazy thought.
No,
it was.

141
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:02.600
It was still want to do it,
but now,
yeah.
Yeah.
Hey,

142
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:06.530
go to go to Shannon,
the Canon Briggs page,

143
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.400
his Instagram page.
There's something very funny that Tucker Cross and said,

144
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:13.250
I know people are like,
oh my God,
don't even quote him.

145
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.560
He said something very funny as shit.
He says,

146
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.850
I'm very funny about some of the news anchor that this is all the men that are

147
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:24.660
going to be left if radical feminists take over the world.
Apologetic.
Yeah.

148
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.770
Bespectacled.
I forget what the way he phrased it,
but it was very funny.

149
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.830
I was like,
there's a lot of fucking people like that.

150
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.040
There's a lot of guys like that out there and it's,

151
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.070
they don't want to be that guy.
They're stuck.
That's all they can pull off.

152
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.430
They're doing probably the smarter move because we're,

153
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.480
we're going down a path where I don't think they're saying all the pendulum will

154
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:48.980
swing back and we're going to eventually be able to celebrate rape culture again

155
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.270
and it's never going to happen.
Okay.

156
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:55.271
We are going down a path where you know on television and their entertainment,

157
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.250
you see what's being booked.

158
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.670
You see what's being pushed out there and look it despite the fact that there's

159
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:01.860
a political message and everything,
there's still some good shit out there.

160
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.570
It's not like you're sending great content.
You know?

161
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:06.720
That's one of the reasons why I posted that Tim Dillon video yesterday.

162
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.680
Do you have that Shannon?
The Canon one,
there's one where he's a,

163
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:15.270
he hits his dude like it's one of his more recent fight clips that he put up.

164
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.470
The fight starts,

165
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.310
it goes like 10 seconds and he steps towards this dude and he hits him with a

166
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.980
left hook to the body and crumple zone and I just want to show he's like a

167
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:25.050
master at the liver,
shot another shot.

168
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.830
He's one of the best heavyweights of all time when it comes to liver shots.

169
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.010
He was so good at it.
If you would have said,
points your liver,
I watch this,

170
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.730
watch this.
This is Shannon cannon.
Watch,
look,
look,
watch this.
Liver.
Bang.

171
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.210
That's it.
See he goes to the body and then down to the gut,

172
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.440
he'll pop you with the jab,
poppy with the hook upstairs.
Watch this,
look at this.

173
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.680
See this is,
they're just showing it.
Boom.
Wants the left hook pop.
What's this?

174
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.410
Upstairs.
Boom.
And then downstairs,
that's one of them.

175
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:53.850
But that's not the one where he stopped the dude.

176
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:55.710
He just came jumping out of the gate.

177
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:58.740
But there's another one I think a little bit further back than that.
Honestly.

178
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.620
It looks like he hits so hard.
He hit so hard.
Oh my giant.

179
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.380
Do two pieces just in general,
like you know,
and you know,

180
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.930
we obviously both watch a lot of [inaudible].
I don't really watch boxing,

181
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.010
but now that I'm a pretty big MMA fan,
I watch boxing in a different,

182
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:14.700
and the way they punch it looks so devastating.
Oh,
for sure.

183
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.410
<v 2>So I remember one time we did a street promotion.</v>

184
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.500
I was running street teams in New York City for comedy clubs.

185
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.100
Like even before I started comedy and we did a thing where we got like boxing

186
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:27.520
gloves and headgear and we went out and we're challenging people to come in and

187
00:10:27.521 --> 00:10:29.500
just box and if they could beat me in a boxing match,

188
00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:31.060
I've never fucking turned the day in my life.

189
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.190
But if they could just simply beat me in a boxing match,

190
00:10:33.191 --> 00:10:34.450
they got free tickets to the show that night.

191
00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:36.790
It was just a way to generate a crowd in my streets and guys were selling

192
00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:39.190
tickets.
If people trying to go to a comedy show.

193
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.600
<v 0>Do you think it helped your act at all?</v>

194
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.820
Like I was even doing comedy at that point had punched,

195
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.200
I wasn't even doing comedies.
Watched this guy.
See that left to the body.

196
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.950
How digs that?
Watch that one more time.
Watch how he sets it up.

197
00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:55.630
He Jabs to the head and then when you cover upstairs,
oh look at that.

198
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:59.260
Boom.
He hits you with a left hook to the face,
but it's a quick left.

199
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:03.160
Took the set up the left hook to the body.
By the way,
he's 50.
Yeah,

200
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.160
I see his beard.
It's a fucking animal.
Can tell by his face.

201
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.270
He wants to find them.
But I think there's also a TRT issue,

202
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.420
but nobody wants to fight him right now.
He has a hard time getting fights.

203
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.190
Well that's his chin,
bro.
Leave his cello.
Don't make fun of his facial hair.

204
00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:21.160
The guy just got fucked up by the cannon.
Let's go chat.

205
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.030
If you go to his Instagram page,
it's all,
let's go champ.
Let's go chat.

206
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:28.720
It's very inspiring man.
Like if I want to feel good,
I go to Shannon.

207
00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:31.840
The canons Instagram page.
Is that where you go?
Yeah,
it makes me feel good.

208
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.970
It's all positive.
It's like,
let's go champ.

209
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.390
And it's like you got to drink more water champ.
You've got to eat healthy champ.

210
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.313
Here it is.

211
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.160
He's always like super friendly and had them on the show once we had them call

212
00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:52.180
in.
Um,
I think Bisbee knows him pretty well.
You gotta be there with them live?

213
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.700
Yeah.
Oh,
he's,
yeah.
All personality.
Yeah.
He's,
he's,
he's uh,

214
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.000
like a battery of black Santa Claus.
Look at him.

215
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.730
He's got some serious white and that beard.
Oh yeah.

216
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.100
I think he's still trying to fight.
He had some sort of a tea.

217
00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.810
Our tea issue don't,

218
00:12:06.811 --> 00:12:09.400
testosterone replacement therapy can make a separate league where you just let

219
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:13.510
the guys,
yeah.
100% steroids and TRT and who cares?
Especially older guys.
Yeah.

220
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.590
Avitar Belfort's now go into one FC and uh,
it looks good.
Again,

221
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.940
looking sexy porn all filled out.
Did you see Eddie Alvarez is I,
yeah,

222
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:26.170
he got fucked up.
Yeah.
That dude,
he fought Timofey um,

223
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.670
as Duke in Nass.
Duke and I think is his last name.
He's the guy is a beast.

224
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.670
That one FC show was legit.
Yeah.
Have you watched it?

225
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.350
I've watched just highlights.

226
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.990
I don't have time and I'm coming to watch all the UFC fights this time.
Um,

227
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.580
so it's hard to kind of to watch the other cards as well,
but once in a while,

228
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.330
Washington Beltour I'll watch one FC Gamma at that.
I,
oh my God.

229
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.740
His Eyes Freddy fucked up.
Oh my God.
That's terrible.

230
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:55.630
That's a terrible injury.
Yeah,
they,
it looks like it's split his eyelid.
It did.

231
00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.430
Oh my gosh.
This is Christ.
It's split his fucking eyelid,
dude.
Oh my God.

232
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.320
People,
people don't realize like that side of it,
like,
I mean,

233
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.640
that's fucking touch your face.
I mean,
you had a little bit of an MMA fight.

234
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.430
You know what it's like.
Not really.
You did,

235
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.410
it was a fight is a fight against another comedian comedian up.
Very impressive.

236
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:22.240
But Hey,
it was,
he had a taekwondo black belt from when he was 14 years old.

237
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:25.660
Take that back to taekwondo black belt.

238
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.220
I think people forget how to do shit,
man,
if you all bullshit aside.

239
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.030
But they also gave out a lot of talk,
Mondo black belts that are 100% portraits.

240
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.840
It's,
it's part of the business.
Even if they're not,

241
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.120
if you're not giving your belts out,

242
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.000
how you're not going to get people to come back.
Dude,

243
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.920
I know a lot of people that were like my son's nine years old,

244
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.370
he just got his black belt.
I want to like,
oh,
what are you even saying?

245
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:48.700
I'll beat the shit out of that kid everywhere.
Well that's the problem.

246
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:52.710
We give another nine year olds will,
most actual tough athletic kid who's,

247
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.620
who's not afraid of getting it.
That's a dinner between kids who like,
we'll do,

248
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.880
you know,
karate and kick a board.
Yeah.

249
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.260
There's also the kids that are just from the hood have been being punched in the

250
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:06.640
face by their uncles and fathers since they were a baby and they are just ready

251
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:09.040
to fight and they're being hit to them.

252
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.520
It's like you get desensitized to it if you're doing any sort of training or if

253
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:14.350
you've,
you know,
you have a really tough environment,

254
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:17.140
you actually get desensitized to it and you realize after being hit a few times

255
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.050
that wants adrenaline kicks in,
it doesn't really hurt.
You know,

256
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.780
it hurts after the fact.
But,
um,

257
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.720
so I think you have those kids that will just,

258
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.310
I mean wreck their shit.
Just a little nine year old from the hood.

259
00:14:30.311 --> 00:14:33.730
That's a tough kid.
Kids that grow up around violence.

260
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.550
If you get in street fights all the time,
if you run other kids,

261
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:39.820
get in street fights,
people show you how to do things,
you learn things.

262
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.330
There's a lot of kids that are 10 11 years old that live in poor neighborhoods,

263
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:47.050
whether it's south Boston or you know,
south side of Chicago,
whatever,

264
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.980
any dangerous neighborhood that's like filled with poverty,
those kids will be

265
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.930
<v 3>more apt to succeed in fights.
They understand how to fight the pull,</v>

266
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.270
the trigger.
They're not going to be,
that's really the thing to know.

267
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:01.970
They have to pull the trigger because people will pull the trigger on them.

268
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.010
Whereas like there's a lot of people that talk a lot of shit,

269
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.110
but they never really pulled the trigger.
You see those guys?

270
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.350
Those are the guys I say pull the trigger.
Obviously I need mean punch someone.

271
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.200
I don't mean you said,
you said Chicago eat anywhere.
It's like,

272
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.390
especially after that.
Nipsey Hussle Gaga kills.
Like,
that's crazy.

273
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.550
That's so sad on video too.

274
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:24.530
They have the fuck I,
I'm not a hip hop fan at all,

275
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.340
but apparently was very positive.
Like antiviolence,

276
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.790
like it wasn't like a thuggie rapper that was promoting,
you know,

277
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.010
drug dealing and gang violence,

278
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:38.060
which I don't really know if even people do that as much anymore.
I don't know.

279
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.560
But by all accounts,
this guy was loved and uh,
you know,
he just,

280
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.670
it's just beyond fucked
just like that,

281
00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:53.030
that,
that is still going on in this world.
It was,
if I'm not mistaken,

282
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.810
um,
he got into a fight with a guy,
right?

283
00:15:56.811 --> 00:16:00.320
And the guy came back with a gun,
don't know,
and shot him.
That's what I read.

284
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:03.050
I think it was like a,
I don't know if those lines,
those lines,

285
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.170
something along those lines,
because the,
this,

286
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.370
when you hear about a hip hop artists come down,
you're like,
oh,

287
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:11.300
is this some longstanding beef?
And you know,
you know,
who knows.

288
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:14.930
But I think it was literally a fight that these guys got in and the guy came

289
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:18.240
back with a gun and just fucking Sutter unloading,
which is spiritual.

290
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.180
That's literally how my father died.
Literally.

291
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.620
Well except whether it was with a knife,

292
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:24.020
which is a much more hardcore way to do it.

293
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.840
But my dad was outside of a strip club at four o'clock in the morning and got

294
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:30.570
into an argument with a kid,
you know,
um,

295
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.220
like a 16 year old kid and they got into a fist fight.
Uh,
you know,

296
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.220
the kid came back like an hour later with a kitchen knife and stabbed him.

297
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.320
That's that.
And it's like,
God,

298
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.910
it also takes a different type of person to,
you know,
to,
to kill.
I'm,
I'm not,

299
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.920
I'm not the kid in the hood who was just ready to pull the trigger and punched

300
00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:51.890
somebody.
Like I'm not,

301
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.230
I grew up in a weird way where it's like I was taught like,
wow,

302
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:58.280
you wait until they throw the first punch,
which is a terrible strategy.
But the,

303
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.110
that's sort of the way that I always,

304
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:02.750
it was always like fist fights in the parking lot with your friends.

305
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:04.010
He won't try to really hurt each other.

306
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.280
It was you got into an argument over a video game and you went out back in the

307
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:11.000
parking lot and you beat each other up for two minutes and then that was that.

308
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.470
Um,
but guys that are,
you know,
willing to kill somebody over whatever,

309
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:20.390
just an argument to take their life completely without any juicy,

310
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.890
they lose sense of the repercussions of it as well,
which is sort of like,

311
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.560
that's something that I think would separate most people and go like,

312
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:29.630
oh well I don't want to go to jail.
There's cameras.

313
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.260
I think a giant chunk of it is how they're,

314
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:37.430
what like what experiences they have growing up.
Like what happens to them?

315
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:40.880
Are they abused or they beaten or they around a lot of violence.

316
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.770
What are they exposed to?

317
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.460
And then how much more likely are you to commit that violence,

318
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.890
push that onto the next person.
That's really what it is.

319
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.870
I mean that's the vast majority.
I mean,
it's not,
uh,

320
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.010
it's not a shocker that so much violent crime comes from poor neighborhoods.

321
00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.180
It's,
it's like it makes itself and makes itself the course,
almost like a virus.

322
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.040
I agree.
And I,
I,
you know,
I grew up,
my mom was extremely abusive,

323
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.790
um,
you know,
and I grew up with,
around a ton of violence,

324
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:11.700
a ton of physical and emotional abuse,
verbal abuse,

325
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.790
always the threat of violence at the drop of a hat.
It was,

326
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:16.410
it was always immediately too.

327
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.840
I'll beat the shit out of you if you don't do what I say,

328
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:24.600
even if she wasn't being violent.
Um,
and I did,
I go the opposite dude.
I,
I,

329
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:27.660
you know,
with my son,
Dude,
I live with my son.
I've never even spanked him.

330
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:30.000
I'd never smacked him on the hand.
I've never,

331
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.880
I've never even really yelled at my son.
Um,

332
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.370
and I don't think that I got lucky and have a good kid.
I do have a good grab,

333
00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:36.931
a great kid,

334
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:41.931
but I think it's a direct correlation to me not being aggressive with him at

335
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.830
all.
And I talk talking's huge,
right.

336
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.770
Have little conversations with them,
not just tell him what to do.
Ask Him,

337
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.350
give them the why.
If they don't understand why,
you know,

338
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.360
that just in general in life,
people just in general,

339
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:00.150
if they understand why something that there's a real purpose there and then they

340
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:03.780
do what they're doing,
you know,
with that purpose in mind.

341
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.120
And I think when little kids there,
you know,

342
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:10.200
they're so malleable and sometimes it's annoying for them to ask why two or

343
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:13.380
three times and it's easy to lose your patients.
Um,

344
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.630
but once you realize what you're,
you know,
that's,
you know,

345
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.670
I'm a piece of shit all admit I'm the first one to admit it.

346
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.870
But the only good thing I do,

347
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:21.660
I think is the fact that I'm creating this good little person.

348
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.440
He's a really good sweet person that I think is going to be,
you know,

349
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:27.990
all the shit that I didn't really have or you know,

350
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.990
all the good qualities that I think I,
you know,
I could have maybe had,

351
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:31.920
if I was raised the right way,

352
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.430
I'm trying to give my son and I think that's a really big responsibility.

353
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:37.290
And that's why,
you know,
you,

354
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.230
I feel bad when you see like real violence like that,

355
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.260
like fucking people that are like being really,
you're like,
dude,

356
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:45.990
I know that person experience some crazy shit.
100%.
It's,

357
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.710
it's not their fault in a weird way.
And it's definitely not,
you know,

358
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:51.570
I never lived in the worst neighborhood in the world,

359
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.720
but I lived in a shady one for quite a bit.

360
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.390
We lived in this place called Jamaica Plain,
uh,

361
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.820
outside of Boston for about a year.

362
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.830
My parents knew immediately who we had to get the fuck out of there and we only,

363
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.910
I think we stayed maybe a year,
a little over a year and a,

364
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:08.600
we got out of there as quick as we can,
but there was like a lot of breakins.

365
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:12.570
A lot of it was lower income.
It wasn't terrible.

366
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.660
It wasn't like a,
a gang violence,
shoot them up type shit.

367
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:19.070
But there was a lot of criminals.
Yeah,
a lot of shady shit.
Shit.

368
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.320
Poverty doesn't have to be like gangs.
It's just shitty.

369
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.220
Do poverty makes people do crazy shit.
It does.
And it makes,

370
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:29.100
I was never around kids that were that aggressive,
like kids.

371
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:32.280
We're always trying to fight me.
And um,
I just moved there.

372
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.890
We just moved there from Florida and I was like,
fuck,

373
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:37.740
I gotta get Outta here and this is what led me to martial art.
How old are you?

374
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.720
13.
Okay.
So you're,
you know,
teenage boy,
almost a man.
I mean,

375
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.390
you're going through puberty at this point.
That's it.
You know,
it's a scary time.

376
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.040
And there was all these kids that were just,
they were,
so

377
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.860
<v 0>they were,
they had already fucked.
They are already doing drugs.</v>

378
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:52.870
They just make a plane,

379
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.370
low income white or white and Puerto Rican like,
uh,

380
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.470
but mostly that mostly white and Puerto Rican.
It was a lot of it.
Uh,
just,
um,

381
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.120
a lot of cigarette smokers at 13 kids are smoking cigarettes,
anything.

382
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.330
They were drinking all the time.

383
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:10.360
I used to like my long cigarettes for her when I was at Penn.
Is that crazy?

384
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.680
I swear to God they could.
Great.

385
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:14.830
Fitzsimmons lived in a house with two parents that were chain smokers in an

386
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:17.230
apartment and they never opened the windows in the winter.
Are you crazy?

387
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:20.470
My mom never just think there's no sense.

388
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.070
My mom smoked her entire pregnancy with me.
Me Too.
My dog.
Yeah.

389
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:25.600
I mean they don't look,
once again,

390
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:30.220
she doesn't know kind of a new date sorta new jury was out on smoking while you

391
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:34.110
were pregnant.
I think in [inaudible] 82 when I was born.
Yeah.
For 82 I'm 67.
You,

392
00:21:34.111 --> 00:21:35.320
your Mama was zero excuses.

393
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.920
My mom was in the 60s.
They didn't know shares that the 60s.
That was like,

394
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:46.560
you had to read a book and she was a little 20.
You know,
my mom was 2010.

395
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.260
My mom was 20 like that.
It's crazy.
Imagine that.

396
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.710
How old were you when you had your first kid for Raisie?
A 40.
You're four.

397
00:21:54.711 --> 00:21:58.330
That's fuck.
That's so perfect.
Yeah.
It's such a perfect time.
I was 30,

398
00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:02.950
which is fine.
It's too young.
I think my mom was 18 when she had my sister.
Yeah.

399
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.610
Um,
it's just the,

400
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.170
just the act of whether it,
no wonder when you start it with,

401
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.180
if you started at 20,
if you started at 40,

402
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.860
the act of raising another human being,
it just changes who the fuck you are,

403
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.400
but just does everything switches and gets weird and then you're like,

404
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.930
oh,
I'm responsible for,

405
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.170
for shaping your life and at least helping to shape your life.

406
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.190
And if I do a good job,
you'll be a good person.

407
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.040
You'll go out there and you'll make more good people and you'll meet good
people,

408
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.370
which is really what everybody wants.
At the end of the day,

409
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.400
everybody wants comradery and love and friendship.

410
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.000
That's why like what's the worst shit that can happen today?
You get canceled.

411
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.680
Everybody wants to cancel people.
You're out,
Ken,
out of here,
you're done.

412
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.740
It's over.
There's a weird,
is a strange,

413
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.950
it's also like I want you to not be able to make money,

414
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.920
but I want you to starve or go home,
be homeless.

415
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:04.840
I don't really understand exact specific,

416
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.810
it's not specific in terms like they don't want you to be able to make an
income.

417
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:08.644
They want to hurt you.

418
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.990
That's what it is because they're scared of someone doing it to them.

419
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.100
This is a big part of why people pull the trigger on that stuff.

420
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.850
Whether I just thought,
well,

421
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.210
people are calling for people to get canceled for like nothing,

422
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:21.250
like little tiny things.
Never again.

423
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.700
It's because they're scared of it actually happening.
So this is like,

424
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.730
you have this ultimate power to to just like get upset at someone for virtually

425
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:35.040
anything.
Pick it,
pick a cause,
whatever it is.
It's also,
it's,

426
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:40.110
it's sort of intoxicating and it's fun and most people don't have real opinions

427
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:43.600
on anything.
And then you have this,
this,
you know,

428
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:46.460
on on Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media platform,

429
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:48.440
you have an immediate gratification of like,

430
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.580
I just got 20 likes on a thought of mine.
Yeah.
That's addictive as fuck.

431
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.940
A super addictive.
You know that.
That right there will,
you know,

432
00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.470
I understand why people continue to come back and nobody really cares.

433
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.540
As soon as you put your computer down at your phone down,

434
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.540
nobody gives a fuck about any of these issues at the supermarket or at the

435
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:08.270
bowling alley or in the library.
That's not what's important.

436
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.820
What's important is the Internet is essentially the whole world is a big window

437
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:17.900
and everyone has a rock.
If you would just look at it,
throw rocks,

438
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.330
and if you find a thing to throw a rock about,

439
00:24:20.331 --> 00:24:25.331
whether it's throw a rock about politics or or gender or race or social justice

440
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:31.520
or you know what,
fill in the blank.
The environment,

441
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.720
the saving,
the animals,
everyone's thrown rocks and you know,

442
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.740
and very few people are a actually communicating.
It's a strange time.

443
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.490
Well you would think that you would want,
in an ideal world,

444
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.320
you would want people that have differing ideas to come together,
sit down,

445
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.830
have an honest conversation.
Yes.
And Go,
awesome dude,
go live your life.

446
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:52.371
I'll live my life.

447
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:55.100
I learned a little bit just now and then you go off and you go,
yeah,

448
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.440
that's how you learn from different cultures.

449
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.360
That's how we ultimately got to a place,
you know,
I think I,
I have,

450
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.430
I think it's a great country.
I,
I in a weird way,
I think it's,

451
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.900
I'm proud to be an American.
I,
you know,
I'm proud.
Um,
you know,

452
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.870
I don't think all the things that people think that are awful about this country

453
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:16.310
or necessarily awful,
um,
you know,
I think the opportunity to make money.

454
00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:21.140
I did grow up on welfare.
I grew up poor and you know,
you know,
I'm,
you know,

455
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:22.130
for all intents and purposes,

456
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:26.510
I'm living my dream right now and I get to kind of do what I want to do.

457
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.170
Um,
and I look at that and I say yes because I live in a place where that

458
00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:32.660
opportunity is there.
Of course,
look,
America is amazing.

459
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:34.070
It doesn't mean it's perfect.
No,

460
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.760
it certainly gives you more opportunity than anywhere that I've ever heard of.

461
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.620
And it's a fun place,
man.
I like it here.
Yeah,
fucking country is fun,

462
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.260
but there's definitely some fucked up aspects of it.

463
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.630
The fact that we're a country,
this is the,

464
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:50.900
the big one is immigration to me because immigration to me,

465
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:55.820
when people take a hard line one way or the other,
I'm always like,
man,

466
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:58.160
this is a weird one.
Immigration is a weird one.

467
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.730
You don't want to diminish the quality of life for everyone in the country,

468
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:04.940
but you don't want to not let people in because that's what the country is based

469
00:26:04.941 --> 00:26:09.290
on.
And we see these fenced in people.
And where is it?
Is it El Paso?

470
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:09.970
There was a,

471
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.250
something that they had on the news where they showed all these people fenced in

472
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.170
and what looks like a dog Kennel.
And these,
these,
uh,

473
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.470
people that snuck across the border and they captured them.

474
00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:22.970
So they just put them in this fucking outdoor fenced in cage.
Like,
dude,

475
00:26:22.971 --> 00:26:25.460
we don't even do that too violent murderers.

476
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.990
You'd have a violent murderer who's due process due process.

477
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:31.300
You put them into prison man.
Right?

478
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.980
Like they don't have the facilities to do what they're doing.
Right.

479
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.590
And then people are like,
well,
it shouldn't be coming across the border.
Like,

480
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.660
I guess so,
but wouldn't you?
I'm also like,
who wouldn't you,
who cares?

481
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.010
Like I,
I understand,
yes there

482
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.000
<v 2>is sort of a,</v>

483
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:50.280
but anybody who is up in arms about immigrants coming to this country,

484
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.210
most of the time they're also on one side of the political spectrum on every

485
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:57.250
other issue.
It's not like it's an independent thought.
It's like the,

486
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:02.070
and everybody that's on both sides,
you know?
And you know,
I just sort of,

487
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:06.720
I'm in a,
I have my own personal life philosophy where I'm not going to solve the

488
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:09.030
immigration issue.
And to be honest,
as we're talking about,
I'm going to like,

489
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:11.220
I don't know.
I,
I have no idea what the answer is here.

490
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.950
People are obsessed with being right.
People always want to have an answer.

491
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:18.790
I don't fucking know.
But I do know that I have things in my life that,
you know,

492
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.210
I can fix.
I know there are,
you know,

493
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.010
the things about my personality and things about me than my own,
you know,

494
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.080
my own issues that I need to fix.
So I'll sort of start there,
you know,

495
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.890
and I think more people need to kind of,
you know,

496
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.590
<v 1>four,
they start espousing opinions,</v>

497
00:27:32.591 --> 00:27:34.960
look at themselves and figure out why they're coming up with these opinions.

498
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.270
Yeah.
Just sort of,
um,

499
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.810
I just pulls on your humanity.

500
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.170
You see a bunch of people caged in with their children and in some fenced in

501
00:27:44.171 --> 00:27:47.110
area that literally looks like a dog Kennel.
Yeah.
This is crazy.

502
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.870
<v 2>Well,
I'm not saying I don't care about that.
I just,
I,</v>

503
00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:53.640
I don't care about people coming in the country and going in these imaginary

504
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:58.200
lines.
I,
I,
you know,
it's just sort,
sorta like,
yeah,
I think it's,
um,

505
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.100
I think as a human being,
it's hard to see that.

506
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.980
And I look away from shit like that a lot.
You know,
I don't look,

507
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.820
I don't like looking at videos like that.
I don't like watching sad things.

508
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:09.930
I don't watch any Gore Shit.

509
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:14.310
I didn't watch the video of the dude that mowed down those people in New
Zealand.

510
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.560
Um,
you know.
Yeah.
It is a sad thing and I really don't know the solution.

511
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.750
<v 1>The shit it says.</v>

512
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:25.560
They treated us like we were animals holding pen from migrant families and El

513
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.920
Paso shut down.
Shut down overnight,
I guess because people found out about it.

514
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.370
It's crazy.
Look at that.
That's,

515
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.410
that's a dog Kennel you means people would just sit around waiting for what?

516
00:28:34.411 --> 00:28:36.420
I mean,
if that was murderers.

517
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.700
<v 2>So let's say you're the guy in charge though.
What do you do?
What would you,</v>

518
00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:41.920
I mean me,
I wish that's a good question.
I'll go let him in.

519
00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:43.210
But I don't know if that's the right answer.

520
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.550
<v 1>I don't know if it's the answer to either.</v>

521
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:48.810
But a guarantee you all of are your relatives came from another country.

522
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:53.720
My relatives all came from another country or the,
I'm third generation.
They,

523
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.990
they knew that Europe sucked.
They knew the Italy sucked.
And so they're like,

524
00:28:57.991 --> 00:28:59.640
look,
I mean no disrespect Italy,

525
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:03.150
but they decided I've gotta get the fuck Outta here.
And they got on a boat,

526
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.760
all of them.
Grandparents on both sides.

527
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.320
They both came over here when they were kids.

528
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.800
<v 2>Does Italy suck?
It seems awesome from everything I've seen about it.
Grateful.</v>

529
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:11.240
Well,
well

530
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.530
<v 1>the food is fantastic.</v>

531
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.530
When I talked to a guy there that was trying to get an understanding because he

532
00:29:15.531 --> 00:29:17.570
wanted his kids to go to college in America,

533
00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.070
anybody who was basically saying was there was just not enough opportunity in

534
00:29:22.071 --> 00:29:23.690
Italy and that,
uh,

535
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.490
he wanted his son to have more opportunity and she was driving a cab.
Actually,

536
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.720
they all speak two languages.
They all speak perfect English.

537
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.590
A good percentage of them.
Yeah.
There,
you know,
it's a smart place.

538
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.650
The Lot and the art is insane.
When you're,

539
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.680
when you're going through Rome and you through

540
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.680
<v 0>the Vatican,
you see their billions of dollars,</v>

541
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:47.830
literally billions of dollars in artwork.
You're like,
Holy Shit.

542
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.130
Like this is what a crazy culture,
this culture,

543
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:55.810
all they wanted to do was create beautiful architecture,
create beautiful art,

544
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.060
make wine,
make great food,
have sex,

545
00:29:58.061 --> 00:30:01.360
fuck like crazy and kind of take over the world.
I mean,

546
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:04.350
they took over the world for a long ass time.
I got no problem with that.
Elise.

547
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.730
Sounds like Gary and people,
but she's now,

548
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.220
today there's not much opportunity if you want to drive a cab,

549
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.660
mixed tomato sauce.
Dude,

550
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:14.500
I was driving with his cab driver with my kids in the car and this guy slowed

551
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:16.870
down to check out this chick's ass and yelled out the window at her.

552
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.030
They're fucking savages,
Matt.
They are a people.

553
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.900
My ancestors,
I'm allowed to say it.
I ape folk,

554
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.250
I s I used to love cat calling and it's terribly funny way though.
It's not a,

555
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.690
it's wrong.
I will preface this by saying it's wrong,

556
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.300
but and as,
as an adult,

557
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:41.530
as a 37 year old man who has a six year old boy,
um,

558
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.050
who will probably watch this one day,
I'll say,
don't do that.

559
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:47.140
Don't do what daddy says.
Do as I say,
not as I do it exactly.

560
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.320
But I will say it was sort of like a funny thing.
We would just,

561
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.030
we just can't call checks in a funny way.

562
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:54.760
We would do it almost like mocking guys who can't call.
However,

563
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:57.790
from the girl's perspective,
she's just being cackled.
Yeah.

564
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:00.910
The girls don't like it unless they really like it.
Well,
it depends.

565
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.060
It could be freaks,
but it's,

566
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.400
it's never worth the risks go one out of 10 may like it.

567
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.810
I had talked about this in my special,

568
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:11.410
but if you go holler at a fucking Puerto Rican check or black chick,

569
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.510
they want it.
They like it.
I'm making a generalization here from culture,

570
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.920
but I'm telling you right now,
it's how it's a different level of community.

571
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.090
I'm telling you go watch in Harlem or he'd go to Brooklyn,

572
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.810
just loose j Gomez defense cat calling on the GRE.
I,

573
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.710
you guys can see I have,

574
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.110
I have a brand new special that we should go much presents the,

575
00:31:30.111 --> 00:31:33.620
they should go here.
It's how right now it just came out on Amazon.

576
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.790
It's out everywhere.
It's out on Itunes,
iTunes,
guested on that bill.com.

577
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.510
What is it again?
Louis J.
Gomez presents Louis Louis J.

578
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.610
Gomez or you get a Dominican pitcher from Miami.

579
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.470
Louis Gomez Gomez is a completely different thing.
Yeah.
That's a poor fishermen.

580
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:51.400
Uh,
um,
what we're just talking about,
we smoked too much pot for the show.

581
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:57.130
It's like,
what's that?
Have you ever had a gay guy?
I try to fuck you.
Yeah.

582
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.430
Are you kidding?
How about a big strong one that could kick your ass?

583
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.740
Like a gay guy that looks like Deontay wilder.

584
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.970
Not that I thought he kicked my ass,

585
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:09.040
but I understand the point that you're making.

586
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.160
If you had a gay guy that you know could kick your ass,

587
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.760
that's what it's like to be a check.
That's what it's like.
I get,

588
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.710
I go to a high end,
Jim,
high end meaning gay meaning you have to like gay guys.

589
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.573
Equinox.

590
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:26.580
It's a gay guys love Equinox and I love the gym was actually my last day job.

591
00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:29.830
I worked doing sales there and uh,

592
00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:32.260
I saw the infrastructure of the company and I know they're,
they're very,

593
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.990
you know,
it's about customer service and I really liked that,
right?

594
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.030
Just selling it right now and telling you when I'm selling memberships,
Chi,

595
00:32:38.031 --> 00:32:39.980
so hit me up selling,
but

596
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.300
<v 2>it's the salesman mode.
I really,
I'm telling,
I'm a salesman through and through,</v>

597
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.650
but I go there now and the steam room,
I mean,
and I,
and I mean this,

598
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.560
I would say one out of eight times out of go on the steam room,

599
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.800
a man will do what it almost like a presenting type thing where he's trying to

600
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:00.620
fish for me to suck his dick.
You know,
like I guess the,
the,

601
00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:03.140
the famous story was like sort of tapping the foot under the stall,

602
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:06.950
but it's not that they opened their towel and the kind of like make eye contact

603
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:07.784
with you,

604
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.360
but they do it in a way where you can't call them on their shit because you

605
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:14.130
can't be like,
cause then you look like a fucking big homophobic.
Right,
right.

606
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.990
So yeah,
it probably on number you what the gay guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.

607
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.970
Um,
probably,
yeah,
but it happens,
it happens a lot.

608
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.920
I've gotten multiple free months there because I complain about it.

609
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.440
<v 0>Wow.
That's a good move.
It's like dropping hair and your own food.
Yeah.</v>

610
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.960
I just saw,
this is reminded me of a video.
I just saw this as a pretty,

611
00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:36.660
I don't know if you've seen this video.
What is this like ringing the bell?

612
00:33:36.661 --> 00:33:37.800
It's only took 20 seconds.

613
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.373
<v 4>Okay.</v>

614
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.420
<v 0>It says man catches guy looking at her in a bathroom stall.</v>

615
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:47.110
He's got his video camera.
It's just pointing at the floor right now.
Okay.

616
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.290
Wash on school

617
00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.940
jeans.
Cause also lying on his boner.

618
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.870
He's just lying on the floor in that.

619
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.400
That's a guy looking to see people shit.
Yeah.
In the sock.
Some cock

620
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:11.240
<v 2>that happened to me at the gym in between the,
the shower stalls,</v>

621
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.310
the guy's face was peeking through.
Oh boy.
Um,
and yeah,
it's a,

622
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.740
and I in a weird way,
because here's the thing,
you can't,

623
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.800
you can't just start beating somebody up for that.
Right.

624
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.720
You can't just say you can't even threaten violence for it.

625
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:26.360
It's a weird thing and you feel very defenseless.

626
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:28.340
And I understand it's the first time I truly was like,
oh,

627
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:32.930
I kind of get what women are talking about because I feel like violated and you

628
00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:34.160
can't really do much.

629
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:39.320
<v 0>I've had it happen and I could beat the guy up.
Yeah.
Like,</v>

630
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:42.230
I haven't had it happen where it was a guy that was not physically a threat to

631
00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:45.650
me and it's still made me super uncomfortable and I felt really weak.

632
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.790
I felt like,

633
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.240
cause you feel like it's also committing a hate crime if you beat this guy up

634
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:53.820
for being gay.
No,
it wasn't.
It wasn't just how aggressive was he?

635
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.140
Super aggressive.
Like touching me,
putting his hands on my shoulders,

636
00:34:57.141 --> 00:34:58.820
tell him he's going to take me up to his room and I'm like,

637
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.010
you better get your fucking hands off.
Wow.
I was like,
this is getting a,
yeah,

638
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.480
you live a different life.
To me.
I just feel,
I feel like a princess.

639
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.360
I feel like just to put why I feel like the Belle of the ball for one day.
Oh,

640
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.900
it was,
um,
it was disconcerting.
But again,
I wasn't physically vulnerable.

641
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.070
Like I could decide that I just wanted to choke this guy unconscious and I could

642
00:35:19.071 --> 00:35:22.250
just do that.
You could choke most guys unconscious.
This guy was not like,

643
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.940
there was no,
no guessing.
You know what I'm saying?
He was not a specimen.

644
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.900
He was a scrawny dude.
Right.
It was just a Oh,
of an aggressive gay guy.

645
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.260
But it's like you go to prison and you know.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's my point.

646
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:37.440
If the roles were reversed,
if it was me aggressively coming onto guy,

647
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:38.070
never worked out

648
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.740
<v 3>a day in his life,
it would be terrifying.
He would just have to take it.</v>

649
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.500
He'd have to take,
well that's what I,
when I was training for that,

650
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.810
a MMA fight against the comedian.

651
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:49.380
I trained with Bisping twice and I grappled with as being in business,

652
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:52.460
not even known for his Jujitsu.
Of course he is.
He,
no,

653
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.360
he's got very Scott Brown belt.
I know his guard.
He's defensive guards.

654
00:35:57.361 --> 00:35:58.380
One of the bests in MMA.

655
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.170
Very rarely do people pass his guard when he's on the ground.
He's,

656
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:04.950
he's excellent.
But primarily he,
you know,
he's known as a striker primarily.

657
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.120
Primarily don't,
I can't explain to you.
It was like,

658
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:14.150
I felt like Elian was just toying with me and it was,

659
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.330
it was a strange thing because I had never in my life.
Cause you obviously,

660
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:20.640
you know an MMA fighter can beat you up.
You know,
like professional,

661
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:21.900
mixed martial arts can beat you up.

662
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:27.350
But I don't think people realize how badly and how big of the gap it is.

663
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.050
Cause it's not,
it's,
but they don't know Joe,
you know,

664
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.300
people have no fucking clue until you do it.

665
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:36.720
And I had no idea until this last summer and I just,

666
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:40.050
and he was fucking around with me for a second.
Yeah.
It was terrifying.

667
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:41.310
And I feel like less of a man,

668
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:44.010
I can't look at my son in the eyes the same way that I used to be able to.

669
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:46.770
I don't fuck right.
You know what anymore?
Like,
oh come on,
you'll be alright.

670
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.780
You know what it's like.
It's like,
um,

671
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.410
do you know how people see someone to stand up and they think I can fucking do

672
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:55.500
that.
Everyone.
That's how we got started.
Right.
Cause you're just talking,

673
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.320
you guys just talking.
That's what fighting is like.

674
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.370
It's like you look at a guy like Bisping and you know,
he's like a normal guy.

675
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:05.040
I mean,
he's obviously very athletic and he's big and everything like that,

676
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:07.410
but he's not Shaquille O'Neal.

677
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:12.150
He's not like some seven foot something specimen.
He's a regular sized human.

678
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.940
So you're like,
well,
he's moving like a regular human.
I could do that,

679
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:19.920
but you have no idea.
It is beyond helpless.
You have no idea.

680
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.660
Literally no idea.
He grabbed a hold of you.
You are,
you're a dead person.

681
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.160
Almost anybody in the UFC,
any,
any person,
the average person,

682
00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.360
if even if you're training,
it doesn't matter.

683
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.340
They can take you this level of do what they want to do.

684
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.220
There's intellectual levels,

685
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:37.680
like I always feel like that whenever I talk to people that are really smart,

686
00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:40.500
like I'm going to have a Sean Carroll or Neil degrasse Tyson or someone on the

687
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:44.940
podcast,
you talked to him.
He just like,
God damn,
I'm fucking stupid.
You know,

688
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:46.650
there's just,
there's levels to this.

689
00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:49.140
There's levels to this understanding of life that's like,

690
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.410
but that's with everything with standup,
but artwork with,

691
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.130
with someone choking the life out of you got says day,
man.

692
00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:59.970
I been doing Jujitsu since 1996 if I roll with certain people,
I just,

693
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:02.010
it's a matter of when I'm going to get strangled.

694
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.530
They don't even have to be bigger than me.
It'd be smaller than me.

695
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:06.780
It's when am I going to tap?
When's it coming?

696
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.160
I had a friend of mine who's like a really athletic dude who I get heat.

697
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.350
He signed a bit of friends,
a friend of a friend,
but he trains out of a,

698
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.810
he's like a trainer out of a,
a Gracie school in Florida.

699
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.360
They're going to be one time he,

700
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:21.330
he got to roll with hoists Gracie and I just have no,
I was like,
I was,

701
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:23.560
what was it like?
Was it like,
was he like that much better than,

702
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.970
because it got us a high level black belt.
Like he's like,
dude,
he was like,

703
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.530
we were talking about levels.
He was like,

704
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.840
he was toying with me like I had never done it before.
And that's how I,

705
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.190
that's how good.
Um,
those

706
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.260
<v 1>guys are.
The hoist doesn't,
you know,</v>

707
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.270
at this point when you compare it compare to these athletic guys.

708
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:42.510
And I made it day,
we saw it with Matt Hughes,
you know,
you know,

709
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.150
he couldn't compete anymore.
Um,
once people sort of knew the tricks.

710
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:51.190
But um,
yeah,
I mean that it's a very humbling,
the whole experience.

711
00:38:51.191 --> 00:38:53.440
Even crazier.
Hixon hoist,

712
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:57.690
his brother hoist will tell you he's 10 times better than him.
Yeah.

713
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.840
Hixon would do to hoists would hoist would do to other black belt.

714
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.830
What was in that sort of the,
the story was they could have had hex him,

715
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:07.750
but he was too athletic and s you know,

716
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:13.190
a bunch of issues and I would not want to say exactly what happened for fear of

717
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.320
upsetting either side.
Cause I think there's two different stories.
Okay.
But,
uh,

718
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.400
he was essentially the champion of the family and one of the thoughts was that

719
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:28.741
it would be a more impressive if hoist did it because Hawaii's was only 175

720
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.600
pounds with his shirt off him.

721
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.240
He looked like he was fit but look like a volleyball player or something.
Right.

722
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.190
Whereas Hicks,
like Freddie Mercury,
Hickson was shredded kicks.

723
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.930
Him was like really in a physical training.
He did a lot of gymnastics and yoga.

724
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:43.150
He was unachievable.
He athletic.
Yeah.

725
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.880
But he was also like way physically stronger.

726
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.900
It would appear more that he was just dominating something like a cat would jump

727
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:51.890
on.
So it wasn't as good of an advertisement for,

728
00:39:51.891 --> 00:39:55.150
it wasn't necessarily true though because it was also taught that no one can

729
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:59.240
control Hicks and it didn't want Hixon to win because Hixon is uh,
he's like,
oh,

730
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.780
a free spirit.
Like in the greatest sense of the word.

731
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:05.290
Like legitimately he might throw his phone in the ocean to disappear for a month

732
00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:07.930
and just fucking surf and do Jujitsu somewhere.
Oh,
he's,

733
00:40:07.931 --> 00:40:10.810
he's a freak in the best sense of the word.
That's awesome.

734
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:14.800
So I don't think they ever thought they could control Hixon that was part of the

735
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.420
problem with having Hicks and be the champion.

736
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.670
Hixon would probably freeze up the whole organization.

737
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:20.530
I want $10 million while they were fight again.
Right.

738
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:24.940
Like they were offering him fights for years and he had some crazy number that

739
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:28.420
he wanted and he was like,
if you give me that number,
I'll fight fade door.

740
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.290
If you give me that number,
I'll fight the best fighters.
Oh yeah.
This is after,

741
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:36.610
after the UFC,
right?
Yes.
What after the UFC started,
but everybody's still knew.

742
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:39.060
See when hoists was winning,
everyone's still knew.

743
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.890
Hickson was competing in something called Japan valley too though.

744
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:45.490
When he won that,
you got to see that super high level Jujitsu pride.

745
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:48.100
One was Hixon,
um,
and uh,

746
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:53.430
Hickson was the guy that everybody knew that if something happened and then

747
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.330
hoist was out of the UFC or there was no other,
uh,
Gracie's in the UFC,

748
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.470
Hixon is always there to step in and we were always wondering when is he going

749
00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:06.390
to step down?
When's he going to fight?
The best guys never did.
No,
he fought.

750
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.050
He fought Funai who was a really high level guy that was his last fight and he

751
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:15.700
strangled them,
uh,
put them to sleep.
It's crazy image man of him.
Rear naked,

752
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:19.450
choke finicky and for Nazi's eyes roll in the back of his head and he goes

753
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:23.290
unconscious and Hickson just throws him off as he stands up.
He was a savage.

754
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.190
Awesome.
I love it.
I got into it and I was younger.
I'm too fat and old now.

755
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.180
[inaudible] he just started nonsense.
How old are you?
I just turned 37 yesterday.

756
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.160
Ordained.
Didn't start doing Jujitsu.
Tilly was 58.

757
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.710
<v 0>Yeah,
around that shit.
There's a,
what's his name?
Al Bondi,
right.</v>

758
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.250
He started late in life.
He did.
Um,

759
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.600
I don't think he was the Hicks and Gracie student,
I believe.

760
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:49.160
I believe he's hoists.
I think he was from Torrance.
So he was,
um,
that was,

761
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:53.780
uh,
like,
that's like Henna and he,
Ron.
Yeah.
Yeah,

762
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.160
you're right.
I could,
and I'm just coming up with an excuse for being a phony.

763
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.370
Totally do it.
I mean,
if you trained for a,
a martial arts fight,

764
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:03.490
you could train for Judaism.
It's a fun thing to learn too,

765
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.980
but that's where I got injured the most was doing Jujitsu.

766
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.450
You fuck up your shoulders.
That which side?

767
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:11.450
My shoulder was dislocated six weeks before the fight.
My hand was broken.

768
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.900
Both of my ribs to this day,
they're just popping out like it just little blurbs,

769
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:19.490
which tour,
poking out in different directions and it hurts continuously tear.

770
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.790
And then the red bull will heal up,
like sticking out a little bit.

771
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.520
And it was all doing,

772
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.620
it was all rolling Jujitsu with guys who were just trying to kick your ass and

773
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:32.920
you just have,
I know I should,
I learn,
talked about,

774
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.130
you talked about that you've gotta be real careful with who you trained with

775
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.880
because uh,
someone was really good,
can train with you and you don't get hurt.

776
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.200
You know,
like if I roll with John Jacques Machado,
like I never get hurt.

777
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:50.570
He never win,
but I never been hurt.
You know,
it's uh,
you,

778
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.570
he's always in control like you're in and everything is like if you roll with a

779
00:42:54.571 --> 00:42:55.041
black belt,

780
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:59.120
it's actually safer then Roland with like a really strong blue belt or a purple

781
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:01.250
belt cause they're just trying to kill you.
They just want those,

782
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.220
they want those tap points.
Maybe be able to get you,

783
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:06.560
especially if you're Louis J.

784
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.650
Gomez from a legion of skanks course and they know bragging rights because one

785
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:13.370
boy fucking get that arm triangle and squeeze the shit out of you.

786
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:19.340
Yeah,
tap had a fucking wrestler.
Big Dick had wrestler was just like,

787
00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:22.940
here's a golf show at a rustle.
A little dude.
He just grabbed me.
Oh No,
no,

788
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:27.140
I'm sorry.
He didn't grab me.
This is,
this is what a pussy I am.
This is what,

789
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:31.400
how tough this fucking guy was.
Huge guy.
Written just nasty,
gnarled up ears.

790
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:34.850
Course college wrestler,
but a big,
big boy,

791
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:37.250
like heavy did I try to take it?

792
00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:39.250
He was showing me how to like pop up and take somebody down.

793
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.580
That's what I'm trying to drill with him.

794
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:44.780
We were drilling good and every time I would do it he would just not let me do

795
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:46.880
it and just fucking flop me on my ass.

796
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:50.090
And one time I tried to do it and when I went to go take him down,

797
00:43:50.091 --> 00:43:52.760
he jerked me in the other direction and my shoulder literally just popped out

798
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.410
altogether all the way out.
It was crazy.
I was like,
there's no way.
Yeah,

799
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.920
it was.
It was nuts.
Um,
you know,

800
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:03.480
and everything hurt going into it and a Bisping,
he basically was like,
dude,

801
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.410
you were his wrapping my hands in the back and my hand was throbbing.

802
00:44:06.411 --> 00:44:08.000
It was broken.
It was just throbbing.

803
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.900
And I was just over and over again re wrapping the house to do it.

804
00:44:10.901 --> 00:44:13.220
It's not right.
You've got to rewrap it a new way.
And he was like,
man,

805
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.280
shut the fuck up.
He's like,
you're not gonna feel anything.

806
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:17.140
As soon as you walk out there,

807
00:44:17.141 --> 00:44:19.220
you're going to feel anything and adrenaline is going to kick in.

808
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.580
And that's that.
And uh,
you're doing wrestling drills.

809
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.640
That's when a lot of guys get really injured and you've got to make sure you're

810
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:28.790
doing them with people that understand it as a drill and understand where your

811
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:32.130
levels at.
That's what's going on with a guy like that.
He's just flexing on.
Yeah.

812
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.930
Yeah.
He's just beating on you,
of course,

813
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:35.850
because he's probably done it a million times.

814
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.240
He's done those drills probably a million times,
but you've done them zero times.

815
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.180
It's crazy.
It's crazy that he would do that and go hard with you.

816
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.690
<v 2>The wrestling sucks dick on so many levels.</v>

817
00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.930
I tried to join the wrestling team cause I was a pro wrestling fan when I was a

818
00:44:47.931 --> 00:44:51.140
kid was like,
I don't know,
wrestle,
wrestle.
First of all I saw was saying let,

819
00:44:51.141 --> 00:44:54.290
I was like that's not happening and my little fucking Dick and flabby acid,

820
00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.040
a singlet.

821
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.250
It's like you have to have a big Dick at a nice but in order to fucking were

822
00:44:58.251 --> 00:44:59.510
saying like,
sorry there's another

823
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.880
<v 0>quote that's a meme right there.</v>

824
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.930
You have to have a big Dick and a nice butt towards,

825
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.720
<v 2>it's the truth.
What do you want me to say?
Crazy?
I'm in the ninth grade.</v>

826
00:45:07.721 --> 00:45:09.970
I'm like I'm waiting for my dick to grow in still.
Okay.

827
00:45:09.971 --> 00:45:11.410
I'm not doing this for another couple of years.

828
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.270
So I joined for like a day and in my high school we had a pool and it was like a

829
00:45:16.271 --> 00:45:19.780
heated pool for the swim team.
I went to a pretty nice high school actually.

830
00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.340
And there was a,

831
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:25.390
they would make us run around the pool but like for like four miles before

832
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.730
wrestling practice,
before,

833
00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.180
before wrestling path thread that was three miles total,
whatever it was.

834
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.210
And it was like a sauna.
So you were doing like a hot,

835
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:39.350
warm up in a hot pool and then you would start training and yeah,

836
00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:41.650
two days later I was like,
fuck this dude.

837
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.880
<v 0>They beat your ass from wrestling.
But that's what makes people so tough.</v>

838
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.550
That's why wrestlers are like mentally some of the toughest people alive.
Yeah.

839
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.630
They're so used to that grind.
They can,
they,
they uh,

840
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.680
they also take pleasure in suffering like no other sport.
Like they enjoy it.

841
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.230
They enjoy not being premadonna.
It's like all the best wrestlers.
If you,

842
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.400
you go back and you look at like the history of amateur wrestling,

843
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:05.940
they're all known as being like hard,
hard man.
Like Dan Gable.

844
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:08.170
Dan Gable was a hard man.
Yeah.

845
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.070
You know that mother fucker just trained his body into the ground.

846
00:46:11.071 --> 00:46:14.460
I think he's got two hip replacements,
two knee replacements.

847
00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:16.960
Does that mean he just just keep going,
destroyed.

848
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.650
He was an animal and he was just a,

849
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:24.480
just was just unstoppable wrestler in its prime.
Yeah.
But that was part of it.

850
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:27.450
It was that,
that mental strength that those guys have.

851
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.050
A lot of those guys don't jump into it later though.
It's also,

852
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:32.040
as we're talking about beating,

853
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.520
you're turning them into pieces of shit because the other side of it as well

854
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:38.130
where you have like it's,
it's in their family,
it's their dad.

855
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.860
They're doing it since they were four,
since they can sure crawl,
they can,

856
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:45.510
they're practicing takedowns and that side of it,
if you're,

857
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:49.050
you know,
in those formative years,
if that's built into you,
that toughness,

858
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.410
et Cetera,
sort of cake walk.
I,
I didn't have any,
I mean I,
I did,

859
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.820
I did just for fun baseball and I wasn't even good at it.

860
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.990
<v 2>Like I could barely hit it or like what's the tea was tea ball.</v>

861
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.330
I could barely hit the ball.
I was so on athletic and my mom,

862
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.290
there was no part of her that wanted to continue to push me to do those things.

863
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.260
So if I said I didn't want to go to,
to just for fun,
she was,
she was like,

864
00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:11.910
all right,
fuck it,
I'm going to take you.
That was sort of,
you know,
right.
Um,

865
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.490
which I think is,
you know,
a problem,
but that,
that I think it's really tough.

866
00:47:15.491 --> 00:47:16.080
That's why you guys,

867
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.830
you see guys like George St Pierre who never did high school wrestling or a

868
00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.040
college wrestling and then jumps into it after the fact and it's like a feeling,

869
00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:24.350
oh man,

870
00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:27.460
<v 0>it makes sense if you know who George is,
it makes sense.</v>

871
00:47:27.461 --> 00:47:30.040
The reason why it makes sense.
There's two reasons.
First of all,
he

872
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.510
<v 1>was very athletic and he already had this leaping inability from karate.</v>

873
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:38.710
So he had this karate blitz ability when you're diving in,

874
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.340
like for a punch or a like a straight blast or something like that,

875
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:47.080
that's very similar to diving in for a takedown in terms of your ability to

876
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:47.914
spring forward.

877
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:52.060
So George already had that with leaping into ponch are leaping into Kik.

878
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.700
So we already had this ability to spring.
Then on top of that,

879
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:58.480
Georgia's super intelligent and he listens.

880
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.570
He has zero ego like I've seen him be coached before.

881
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:06.571
I seen him like do Jujitsu would like Donna her or like really elite high level

882
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:11.110
guys and there's a lot of these videos of it online.
He's very coachable.

883
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.180
He listens to everything is no ego.
He's not trying to do it a different way,

884
00:48:15.181 --> 00:48:18.850
is trying to listen to you a hundred percent guys like that there it's a shorter

885
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:23.851
path to understanding the technique and to proficiency because they,

886
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.450
they listen.
Some people don't all,
they don't listen all the way.

887
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.000
They listen a little bit but then they want to try it their way.

888
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.310
Like even when they're training and sparring,
you'll say,
listen,

889
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:35.740
listen for this round.
I just want you to just try it this way.

890
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.530
Just do this one thing and they'll try it for a couple of seconds in.

891
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:41.500
They'll give up and go back to the old style and you're like,
what happened?

892
00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.420
Like I didn't feel comfortable.
Like that's the point.

893
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.910
Like this is how you get better.
Georges is the opposite.

894
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.130
He listens really coachable.

895
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:53.020
I guess just he just understands the technique is everything.
It's everything.

896
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:54.670
And if you understand,
if you,

897
00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:58.540
you could learn like two or three techniques and have,
uh,

898
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.580
like a real high level proficiency,

899
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:03.790
if you just continue to drill them and understand the counters,
like it's not,

900
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:07.000
he's not like doing a lot of like crazy shit inside the octagon when it comes to

901
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:10.150
wrestling and not like a Ben Aspirin type style,

902
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:14.590
but what he is doing as a power double,
he's got awesome singles on both sides.

903
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.800
He knows how to take people down.
He knows how to stuff takedowns yeah,

904
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.020
just those things alone.
That's all he needed to impose his MMA game.

905
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:25.090
<v 3>Yeah.
Georgia,
I mean,
to this day,
one of my favorite fighters.
Um,</v>

906
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.390
you know,
uh,
but yeah,
he was sort of,

907
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.290
he always like stood out as the guy that like,
um,

908
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:37.420
yeah,
I mean,
just didn't,
you know,
guy wrestled better than everybody without,

909
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.760
you know,
having to do that earlier and then got,
you know,

910
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:42.760
guys like Ben Aspirin who he's a fucking monster.
I,
he's also hilarious dude.

911
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:47.110
I think Ben aspirins.
Sorry.
So funny.
He's,
he's such a troll.
I love,

912
00:49:47.111 --> 00:49:51.490
I love a guy who just doesn't shy away from it.
Yeah.
Um,
trolls.

913
00:49:51.491 --> 00:49:55.540
His boss trolls still continues to this day.
It just makes a game out of it.

914
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:56.190
It's hilarious.

915
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.140
<v 1>Yeah.
He's a funny dude.
Um,</v>

916
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.820
what also what George Saint Pierre has is a extreme physical ability.

917
00:50:02.821 --> 00:50:07.370
Like you could do back flips.
He does a lot of fucking gymnastic stuff.
He,

918
00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:11.130
he's just,
his Hickey has excellent command over his body.

919
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.700
<v 3>You would see him like doing like those like gymnastic training things where</v>

920
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:18.400
he's like doing like super crazy like,
you know,

921
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.080
core strength balance beam type shit.
And I made at that point once,

922
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.930
you know,
you ever can still really guys doing that?

923
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.190
No other guys in the sport are sort of looking to,

924
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.850
<v 1>it's another level of cross training and getting your body prepared for like</v>

925
00:50:31.851 --> 00:50:34.220
something that it's not really prepared for exactly.

926
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:38.960
And yourself out of your comfort zone.
That's,
that's um,
know one of the,

927
00:50:38.961 --> 00:50:40.970
I just,
I really wish I would've when I was a kid,

928
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.800
I wish I would have done more sports.
I wish I would've had.

929
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:45.350
What did you play sports when you were a kid?
Nothing like a baseball player,
Joe.

930
00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:46.460
I did play baseball.

931
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:52.150
I actually quit doing everything else but martial arts because of baseball and

932
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:55.390
went to see a red sox game at Fenway Park.
And when,
uh,

933
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.840
me and my buddy were coming home,

934
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.980
there was like crazy crowds of people trying to get on the t,

935
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:03.110
which is the train to get home.
So,
um,

936
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.160
we just for while we were walking by this taekwondo gym,

937
00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.190
I walked upstairs,
I want to see what it was all about.

938
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.870
And as I was walking up the stairs,

939
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:15.260
there's this guy named John Lee who was a national champion at the time and one

940
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:18.110
of the best black belts this God shake him ever produced.

941
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.430
And he was murdering this heavy bag.
I mean murdering.
Yeah.

942
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.730
He was hitting it with these spinning back kicks that was making this sound like

943
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.593
oop.

944
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.510
And then you hit cheek with the chains would would snap because uh,
I mean,

945
00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.180
just extend to their full length because he was kicking this bag and it was

946
00:51:35.181 --> 00:51:36.200
flying through the air.

947
00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.790
And so I'd never seen anything and that was as close to him doing that as Jamie

948
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:41.630
is to me right now.

949
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.330
Cause there was like a little wall and there was a heavy bag there and the way

950
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.780
Mr. Kim and Mr O'malley,
Michael O'malley,

951
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:50.570
who was also the head instructor where Mr. Kim was gone,

952
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.580
they set up the bags right there cause they knew that if people are coming in

953
00:51:53.581 --> 00:51:56.360
and thinking about signing up and we've got like John Lee's kicking the bag,

954
00:51:56.361 --> 00:52:00.450
you're like I want to do that.
How the fuck do you do that?
Are you athletic?

955
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:04.070
Can All cook where you wrestled?
I wrestled,
I did.
Um,

956
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.710
I've wrestled also while I was doing taekwondo for one year.

957
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:09.440
It was too much to do too at the same time.
But I did a,

958
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:12.160
I played baseball but I wasn't very good.
I just liked,

959
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.680
I never ever tried to get on base.
I always tried to hit home runs.

960
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:17.720
The coach said just hit a strangle or straddle strangle.

961
00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:21.920
We really need this by gay.
Fuck you there and swing for the bleach.

962
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:26.900
I think give a fuck man.
Either struck out on the finger,
Bang,

963
00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:31.700
a chick at the pep rally.
I hit one home run once and that was it.

964
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.380
I was like,
oh,
I can do that.

965
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.430
Like I didn't know I could do that because as a little kid I could swing pretty

966
00:52:37.431 --> 00:52:41.480
hard and you know the their light bats and the kids aren't throwing very fast

967
00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:43.610
and what else is 13 too,
you know?

968
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:47.510
And but from going to that one taekwondo gym,

969
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.320
watching that one guy,
he became like a mentor to me and a lot of ways.

970
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.710
And you went back to that Jim specifically.
That was the 100% I was like,

971
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:57.800
I never saw anything like that.
I had done a little bit of martial arts by then.

972
00:52:57.801 --> 00:53:02.410
I did a little bit of karate,
but not much.
But I never saw anybody kick it back.

973
00:53:02.411 --> 00:53:05.210
The CRI school that I went to,
they didn't emphasize that,
which it's a very,

974
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:08.360
very important part of developing power.
You have to be able to kick a bag.

975
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.630
I don't think I,
there was any bags in the taekwondo school that I went to town.

976
00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:15.410
I was out that it's,
it's a foolish mistake that a lot of gyms make.

977
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.640
They emphasize speed and uh,

978
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.080
like kicking pads,
overpower,
you have to have the power.

979
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.220
We're just break some ice.
Got to get a bag.

980
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.700
You got to hit a bet because the bag resists,
if it's a hundred pounds,

981
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.880
you got to realize that you're not just hitting this thing.

982
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:35.430
You're also pushing a hundred pounds with your foot.

983
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.170
You're pushing a hundred pounds of your foot.

984
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.690
So if you're standing in front of a hundred pound bag,

985
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:43.020
well but you're not just hitting it hard.

986
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.100
You're moving a hundred pounds with your hips and your legs and your apps and

987
00:53:47.101 --> 00:53:51.120
your core,
that's,
that's yes,
you're actually getting a real,

988
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.560
it's a Plyo.

989
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.220
There's actual physical resistance in terms of weight and that's how you get

990
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:59.820
stronger.
It's the only way,
the only way you really develop like destruction,

991
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:01.740
power,
like you know that some people

992
00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.940
<v 2>can you do that though because that's the whole thing where I look cause I was</v>

993
00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:06.860
researching like how do you,
how do you hit harder

994
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.660
<v 1>or you can hit harder.
You can't hit as hard as some people.</v>

995
00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:14.140
Do you think a guy can teach inside of have knockout power?
No.

996
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.000
You either have it or you don't.

997
00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.690
I think you can increase someone's power and most people can knock people out.

998
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:24.610
Most people,
if you taught them where to hit someone and they hit someone clean,

999
00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.690
they could hurt someone.

1000
00:54:25.691 --> 00:54:28.760
Especially most men who actually know how to punch a little bit.
Yeah.

1001
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.980
But there's a big difference between that kind of punching power and say like a

1002
00:54:32.981 --> 00:54:37.090
Tommy Hearns and his prime punching power or a,
you know,

1003
00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:41.440
a Lennox Lewis straight right hand like this.
You don't,
you don't have that man.

1004
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:44.140
No.
You either have that or you don't have that.
And some people just say,

1005
00:54:44.141 --> 00:54:47.440
I saw guys that were like fucking 15 they had that.
It was crazy.

1006
00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.890
He'd watch guys that like at a young age,

1007
00:54:50.891 --> 00:54:54.820
they would hit a pad or hit a bag and he'd be like,
fuck,
this is crazy.

1008
00:54:54.821 --> 00:54:57.220
Like how you have so much power and you don't know why.

1009
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:01.670
<v 2>You don't know the strategy.
They can be any,
well,
actually we add that story,</v>

1010
00:55:01.671 --> 00:55:03.890
but I was saying when we do that promotion in the street in New York City,

1011
00:55:03.891 --> 00:55:08.560
where if the headgear on gloves,
uh,
a little Mexican kid comes up,
doggies,

1012
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:12.020
oh,
this guy was 123 pounds soaking wet.

1013
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:16.010
Little Mexican kid comes up and I'm like,
I'm,
I'm my size.
You know,

1014
00:55:16.011 --> 00:55:19.250
I'm 20 at the time,
maybe 21 or whatever.
But I'm just like,
you know,
by the way,

1015
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.080
I had never thrown a punch in my life.

1016
00:55:21.081 --> 00:55:24.500
Now that I actually watch fighting and they're standing a little bit as a fan,

1017
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:29.780
like I,
I didn't have to stand,
I had no idea.
Did this Mexican kid,
he came up,

1018
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:32.810
he just faked a body shot and hit me with a hook.

1019
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.120
And I remember it,
it felt like,
because there was no adrenaline,

1020
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:42.470
it was a game for me.
It wasn't like,
you know,
it felt like my head was shook.

1021
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.620
It felt like my entire,
I'd never been hit saw it.
To this day,

1022
00:55:45.621 --> 00:55:48.620
I've never been hit so hard in my entire life.
Dude,
I took a knee.

1023
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:52.460
I literally took a knee and that's all I remember.

1024
00:55:52.461 --> 00:55:53.540
I don't even know what happened after that.

1025
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:57.680
That kid just went off being awesome and,
and then I remember thinking,

1026
00:55:57.681 --> 00:56:00.440
cause I always look,
I want a box,
I want to get into boxing.
That'll be fun.

1027
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.820
And that was the moment I was like,

1028
00:56:01.821 --> 00:56:06.320
I'm not going to box them too big the way that could hurt me the way that felt.

1029
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.900
No fucking way.
No Way.

1030
00:56:08.901 --> 00:56:12.530
If our 230 pound guy where to hit me,

1031
00:56:12.531 --> 00:56:14.440
like especially if you went to the wrong

1032
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.760
<v 1>Jim and they had you sparring right away,
which a lot of gyms do,</v>

1033
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:21.160
they'll throw guides to the wolves just to see if they're worth keeping around.

1034
00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.630
Well they'll try you like out of the street,
they'll show you a few punches,

1035
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.880
have you hit the pads a little bit,

1036
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:31.050
tell you to keep your hands up then the heavy bar.
I've seen it happen man.
Sure.

1037
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.190
No,
just to let you know.

1038
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:36.080
And sometimes you know that you'll be sparring with a pro so they won't hurt
you.

1039
00:56:36.081 --> 00:56:38.680
They're just pop you a little bit pop pop to the body pop.

1040
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:42.430
Just try and get some work in,
you know,
just looking for an easy target.

1041
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:46.600
So I do with my girlfriend when we box,
just fucking boss.
Just touch,

1042
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:51.190
just to let her know,
let her know,
hey know it could be worse.
Boxing is the,

1043
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.730
the problem with it as a casual thing though is the punches that don't even hurt

1044
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:59.530
you.
They're just raw.
Rattle your head a little.
Those all count,
all those count.

1045
00:56:59.531 --> 00:57:02.830
And those are probably sometimes worse.
Yeah,
because there's so many of them.

1046
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:05.620
You don't even notice.
Like if you get hit with one big shot,
you'll stop.

1047
00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.890
Like your,
your head gets rattled,
you had a headache,
you sit down,
you're like,

1048
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:13.360
oh fuck.
But you'll stop.
If you get hit a few times,

1049
00:57:13.361 --> 00:57:16.390
you treat it like it's nothing.
He did this get popped a few times.

1050
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:17.224
You're in the air,

1051
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.340
<v 2>hit 30 seconds later,
you got a bloody nose,
you're lips tweeting a little.</v>

1052
00:57:20.341 --> 00:57:21.660
Now I got something over your eye.

1053
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.340
<v 1>You don't think about it,
but you got hit in the head 30 times.
Yeah.</v>

1054
00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:26.850
He never got dropped.
So you're like,
I'm fine.
I didn't take any damage.

1055
00:57:26.851 --> 00:57:28.170
But you did.
You just don't,

1056
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.010
you don't think of that as damaged and now they're understanding that that is as

1057
00:57:32.011 --> 00:57:35.550
much of what you're seeing from CTE.
Is that sub concussive trauma?

1058
00:57:35.551 --> 00:57:39.600
Probably more so because it's so frequent now.
Over and over again.
Yeah,
man.

1059
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:43.590
Everything man.
Dr. Mark Gordon said fucking jet skis.

1060
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:45.160
He said the bang of jets

1061
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.760
<v 2>skis Hanae when you're humping.
Wait.
He's like,</v>

1062
00:57:48.761 --> 00:57:53.110
that's terrible for your fucking head.
Like,
how about Angus young from AC DC?

1063
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.240
I'd like to do with it.
I keep banging his head and he'll get his leg out

1064
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.560
<v 1>MRI to see like how maybe is the fibers of his brain a strengthened from a</v>

1065
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.060
hundred years ahead.

1066
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:07.120
<v 2>Maybe.
I used to go to like metal concerts and go to mosh pits.</v>

1067
00:58:07.121 --> 00:58:11.200
I was like a big metal head when I was a kid and uh,
yeah,
we were just fucking,

1068
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.990
yeah,
you get brain damage.
He's go in there and sort of swing your hands,

1069
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:15.430
get punched gift and you're,
you're right.

1070
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:17.970
You don't think about the amount of light just headbanging.
Yeah,

1071
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.450
just banging your head over and over again.

1072
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:23.170
Your brain is just smacking into the front of your fucking face over and over

1073
00:58:23.171 --> 00:58:23.780
and over again.

1074
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.130
<v 1>Gimme some lazy DC.
Jamie red eyes had begun.</v>

1075
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:31.490
Angus would on stage play and Headbang at the same time.
Yeah,

1076
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.520
like try rubbing the top of your head and your stomach at the same time.

1077
00:58:37.671 --> 00:58:41.990
You know how you do that now?
Imagine patting your head and imagine.

1078
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.550
Now imagine trying to play guitar and Headbang at the same time and then catch

1079
00:58:46.551 --> 00:58:51.410
all the tunes.
Fuck,
I was in a band when I was in high school too.
I played drums.

1080
00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.850
That was a,

1081
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.100
<v 5>okay.</v>

1082
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.630
<v 1>Yeah,
we all,
I think we all want it to be,
we all want to be rock.
So I was,</v>

1083
00:58:56.631 --> 00:59:01.210
did you want to be a rock star when your kid or nope.
Nope.
No Way.
No.
No music.
No.

1084
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:05.390
Nope.
No,
no musical talent whatsoever.
I look at these,
all these group,

1085
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.960
he chicks from the 70s hilarious.

1086
00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.530
<v 5>Look at them.</v>

1087
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:16.270
<v 2>So why did he hear any means to stories about like even when we're talking
Molly,</v>

1088
00:59:16.271 --> 00:59:19.570
Chris,
I'm going to go,
wow,
how are we not hearing like crazy me too?

1089
00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:22.070
Stories about shit with like rock bands

1090
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.670
<v 3>in the eighties and seventies I think is everybody knew what they were getting</v>

1091
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:29.630
into.
I think they knew they were getting into a lot of the times now,

1092
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.190
but it's just,

1093
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:33.980
you think that at least somebody would want to come out and go like,
oh,

1094
00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:35.300
just so you know,
uh,

1095
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:40.330
guns and roses ran a train on me in 1987 just Fyi and I was really intoxicated.

1096
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:42.680
Maybe it's a different time.

1097
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.530
Like those ladies had a different approach to things.

1098
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:50.270
Oh look,
I,
they were there for the memory.

1099
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:54.980
I think the reality is most people,
they sort of go like,

1100
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:57.200
all right,
well I'm respond.
I am responsible for my actions.

1101
00:59:57.201 --> 00:59:58.160
That's where most people,

1102
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:02.600
I don't think most people actually have a victim mentality when they look at

1103
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:05.620
stupid shit that they've done in their youth.
I think most people go like,
yeah,

1104
01:00:05.621 --> 01:00:07.310
I was a fucking idiot.
I shouldn't have done that.

1105
01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:10.190
So a lot of shit I shouldn't have done.
There's both things,
right?

1106
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:15.550
There's some people don't have a victim mentality and then there's also some

1107
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:21.440
people just became victims back then and they just didn't have a a way to

1108
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:24.440
express it like they do now.
Yeah.
Is a different,

1109
01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.730
like it was a completely different world 2030 years ago.

1110
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:33.410
How would you even start to get the message out that you were Mitsu too in 1981

1111
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:37.670
yeah.
I'm going to write a letter to a publisher.
What would you do if you got,

1112
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.790
if someone is sexually assaulted you in 1981 what would you do?

1113
01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.340
I mean go to the cops.
Yeah.
You'd have to try to call a newspaper.

1114
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.180
Maybe they would,
you know,

1115
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.480
if the guy was a rich guy turned his lawyers on you.

1116
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.830
Yeah.
Different world.
It's all,
it's,
I mean,

1117
01:00:55.850 --> 01:01:00.850
I'm a of the Steven pinker view of a progress that I think that although the

1118
01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:05.880
world is not perfect,
I think it's just way better than it sounds.
Way Better.

1119
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:09.550
Yeah.
It feels worse because we have the Internet and your,

1120
01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:13.430
would you have access at your fingertips to the most vile shit?

1121
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.140
It's constant.

1122
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:19.790
Seems like people are more racist because before you used to have to write the n

1123
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:22.610
word on a bathroom stall.
That was the only way to say,
Hey,

1124
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:27.050
credit group.
Yeah,
yeah.
Whatever it is.
And there's a,

1125
01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.910
you can sort of get that instant reaction.

1126
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:32.060
You had to go back the next day and there's another guy that drew an arrow to

1127
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:34.970
that and was like,
yeah,
but what about the Jews?
And then it kept on going down,

1128
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:39.950
but now you sort of have that instantly at your fingertips.
So it feels like,

1129
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:43.100
oh my God,
the world's crumbling.
Everyone's race has everyone sexist.

1130
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:47.030
But everyone's got an opinion online and once you get off there,

1131
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.350
you know,
we all coexist.
We all,
we all work together.
We're all doing shit,

1132
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:56.120
you know?
Yeah,
we certainly can.
Yeah.
I mean people,

1133
01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:01.130
there's a lot of this nonsense like energy on a,

1134
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:01.881
on social media.

1135
01:02:01.881 --> 01:02:06.020
We're two people just arguing about things all day long and people all day long

1136
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:10.760
and that shit is so bad for your head to engage in that all day.

1137
01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:15.350
Yeah,
it feels way better to not engage and it feels way,
but every time I travel,

1138
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:19.210
anytime,
if you see me on Twitter talking shit back and forth,
I'm on an airplane,

1139
01:02:19.211 --> 01:02:21.960
the board and I just,
I did it yesterday.

1140
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:24.930
I won't even name the guy that's a blogger.
He didn't even watch my special.

1141
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:28.560
This cocksucker just took shots at me because he doesn't like me.

1142
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.540
And I was just just engaging back and forth over and over again.
And uh,

1143
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:37.410
it's because I'm bored.
Did you feel gross though?
After it was over now,

1144
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:40.710
cause I just deleted it.
I was like,
all right,
I'm done.

1145
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.550
Like I said what I had to say.
Um,
but I also,
I don't know,

1146
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:48.930
like I,
there's part of me as well,
like I've gotten,
you know,

1147
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.170
you get so much shit eventually you sort of get desensitized to it so that you

1148
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:54.840
don't really,
I mean you're,
you know,
you're fucking famous.

1149
01:02:54.841 --> 01:02:57.100
You get critics like real critics.
I mean your,
your,

1150
01:02:57.101 --> 01:02:58.680
your specialist been reviewed by real people.

1151
01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:00.630
I'm sure some people didn't like it.

1152
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.420
I'm sure you've had to have a bad fucking critic out there,

1153
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:05.430
but at this point you're like,
ah,
who gives a fuck?

1154
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.890
I just think overall in general it's better to be who gives a fuck.

1155
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.360
Cause I think there's,
there's criticism that's valid that you understand.

1156
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:14.681
Like you,

1157
01:03:14.681 --> 01:03:18.030
you should be able to know whether you fucked up or whether something was good

1158
01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:20.080
or not.
You should be able to look at it and go,
oh,

1159
01:03:20.081 --> 01:03:23.580
that wasn't my best work and be honest about that.
Um,

1160
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.510
<v 1>but then once you are honest about that and you,
you do your best work,</v>

1161
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:30.090
like either you like it or you don't.
The idea that everyone's going to like it,

1162
01:03:30.091 --> 01:03:33.300
it's crazy because people just don't like the same things that you didn't ride.

1163
01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.370
He likes what you're doing.
It fucking stinks.

1164
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:38.430
There's someone out there listening to Fleetwood Mac 24,
seven.
Okay.

1165
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:41.460
They never heard a fucking Tupac Song.
There's no biggie in their car.

1166
01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:42.630
They never listen to Nas.

1167
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.550
It is fucking Tusk all day long every day.
That's okay.

1168
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.660
That's okay too,
man.

1169
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:53.370
You know if you're really into Fleetwood Mac and someone tries playing,

1170
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.570
you know some led Zepplin and you're not into it and you get angry,
okay,

1171
01:03:57.571 --> 01:04:00.270
that's not your fault.
It's just like that's not what you're into.

1172
01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.480
If if someone comes to see you and they go,
oh,
this guy's just not for me,

1173
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.380
but then some 25 year old guys like Bob,
I love it.

1174
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:11.870
<v 3>Well he's not wrong.
No,
everybody has a different opinions.
Right?
Actually,
Joe,</v>

1175
01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:17.120
that guy gets it,
gets it.
He gets you.
If you go,
well,

1176
01:04:17.121 --> 01:04:22.121
if you go to a comedy club in general and if you vocalize that you do not enjoy

1177
01:04:23.331 --> 01:04:28.070
the show in any way,
I could sort of look cause she was an asshole.

1178
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.200
I just don't

1179
01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.110
<v 1>need to do that because you,
you can have an opinion.</v>

1180
01:04:32.111 --> 01:04:33.520
There's nothing wrong with having an opinion,

1181
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:37.150
but for you to say that your opinion is more important than the whole show is

1182
01:04:37.151 --> 01:04:38.910
crazy.
Yes,
because that's what you're doing.

1183
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.440
You're either doing one of two things.
Either your ego is so inflated,

1184
01:04:41.441 --> 01:04:44.320
you think you're going to correct this person and you're going to stop their

1185
01:04:44.321 --> 01:04:47.560
jokes in its tracks and they're going to realize the error of their ways and

1186
01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:48.640
it's gonna make them a better person.

1187
01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.720
And you're going to also educate this entire crowd.

1188
01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:54.680
It's been laughing at this awful stuff that's a full hardy way of looking at

1189
01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:56.460
<v 3>not gonna happen.
Also,
if you know that the way comedy works,</v>

1190
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:59.390
you realize you just pissed off the comic cause now he's going to fuck,
dude,

1191
01:04:59.391 --> 01:05:00.540
I'm working on this bill.

1192
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:04.380
I'm trying now I have a new way of wording this tonight and now I want to do it

1193
01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:07.320
a certain way and you just went and fucked that up.
You asshole.

1194
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.510
And maybe maybe I'm going to get there.

1195
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.020
Maybe I'm going to get to a place where you actually enjoy the joke you
dickhead,

1196
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.250
but you've ruined it now.

1197
01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:14.750
<v 1>Well,</v>

1198
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:19.750
the thing is people see every time on stage they see you as this is a finished

1199
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:22.600
product you're presenting.
What they don't understand is,

1200
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:26.230
and I'm hoping people get it more now than they ever did before,
but this,

1201
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:27.910
some people still don't get it.
It's a year.

1202
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.950
The way we work stuff out is by trying it on stage and sometimes we take chances

1203
01:05:32.951 --> 01:05:35.950
and sometimes over again,
and sometimes those chances come out terrible.

1204
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.080
And it's not that we're a bad person,

1205
01:05:38.081 --> 01:05:41.440
we're trying to figure out the right combination of things and sometimes you try

1206
01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:42.490
to do it in the moment.

1207
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:46.910
<v 2>Best Shit that everybody really likes,
where people who are taking risks,</v>

1208
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.793
there's very,

1209
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:50.630
all of the greats you're talking about everyone that when people are about their

1210
01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:52.010
top 10 lists of Comedians,

1211
01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.390
these are people who took some chances is takers 100% you didn't have a cell

1212
01:05:56.391 --> 01:05:58.010
phone to watch what they were doing in the club.

1213
01:05:58.011 --> 01:05:59.360
And the night that the joke bombed,

1214
01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:03.470
you know where you know whoever's talking about,
you know,

1215
01:06:03.471 --> 01:06:04.880
which apart talking about smoking crack,

1216
01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:08.300
he had nights where that joke bombed and nobody's laughing and there's somebody

1217
01:06:08.301 --> 01:06:10.910
that went,
you know what?
My Dad's addicted to crack.
That really bothers me.

1218
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.170
But nobody,
it just was a different time.

1219
01:06:12.171 --> 01:06:17.030
So nobody had the outlet to sort of express that.
Um,
I think that,
yeah,

1220
01:06:17.031 --> 01:06:20.210
I mean they're Patrice O'Neal who,
I mean,
in my opinion,

1221
01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.960
greatest comedian to ever live.
Um,
uh,
also a Boston guy.
Um,

1222
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.020
and he,
you know,
he talked about it,
um,

1223
01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:33.040
when I think he was defending his either Kramer or a radio guys dominant don

1224
01:06:35.461 --> 01:06:38.500
imus soon defendants the nappy headed hoes common app.

1225
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.480
And he was just talking about how,
you know,

1226
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:43.700
it's a joke and jokes whether they're good or bad,

1227
01:06:43.701 --> 01:06:45.950
they all come from the same place as this idea.
And I'm like,
well,

1228
01:06:45.951 --> 01:06:49.100
I wanna I wanna this is something funny and I'm going to go turn it into

1229
01:06:49.101 --> 01:06:50.750
something that's going to hopefully make people laugh.

1230
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.760
The end result is a very much a net positive room of people laughing.
Right?

1231
01:06:55.130 --> 01:07:00.130
And sometimes you take that chance and it bombs and it hits people the wrong way

1232
01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:03.170
and you're like,
oh,
I fucked up.
I said it wrong.
I didn't do it right.

1233
01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.900
But it's wrong.
It's not,
the wrong isn't the right word.

1234
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.041
<v 1>Well,</v>

1235
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:10.540
the problem is we're trying it out with the people you need the audience to help

1236
01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.300
you create the best that they're in the process.
They don't think of them.

1237
01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:16.930
So you don't understand it more.
Well,
they don't understand it.
And so like,

1238
01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:20.320
I mean you don't have to laugh.
Like I know it's not funny if it comes out wrong,

1239
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:24.780
but if you,
if you get mad at someone for something that's not done yet or in la,

1240
01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:29.020
but there's,
you know,
there are points in time where someone can say something.

1241
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:33.490
It's so egregiously incorrect that at the very least you want to leave the room.

1242
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:38.170
I get that.
I mean I've seen it.
I've seen people say things on stage.

1243
01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:41.380
They'll be hard to get you to leave a room for anything.
There's no,

1244
01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:43.930
there's not many subjects.
I thought it was stupid.

1245
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.730
If it was insulting to my intelligence,

1246
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.510
if I was frustrated listening to this idiot talk onstage,
I would leave the room.

1247
01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:50.750
Yeah.
Nothing wrong with leaving the room.

1248
01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:54.070
But there's a big difference between leaving the room and yelling out,
hey man,

1249
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:56.920
what you're saying is not funny.
This is not funny.
I don't care.

1250
01:07:56.921 --> 01:07:59.620
What the hell are these fucking people are laughing and shit's not funny.

1251
01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:02.680
You should stop talking about it.
Like that's nonsense.
That's nonsense.

1252
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:07.300
Like you're not a fucking court where someone's reading affidavit stupid.

1253
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.540
This is someone trying to make funny out of life.
Yeah,

1254
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.690
it either works or it doesn't,
and if it doesn't,
that's okay.
I'll figure it out.

1255
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.130
Or I won't figure it out.
Be The way.
This is just

1256
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.640
<v 0>the process.
You yelling out something,
you know,</v>

1257
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:23.120
throwing up your flag of virtue in front of everyone.
It's just preposterous.

1258
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:26.150
It's like you don't,
you don't get to do that at a comedy club,
men's right,

1259
01:08:26.151 --> 01:08:30.230
or they kick you out.
It's just a stupid,
it's a stupid way to handle it.

1260
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:33.680
And then when guys are like,
I'm helping the show,
oh my God,

1261
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.780
that is the ultimate stupid.
No,

1262
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:39.170
just because everyone's laughing now because I'm roasting you doesn't mean

1263
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:44.070
you're helping the show.
Stupid.
It's a God damn.
Usually I,

1264
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.480
I'll just have the audience turn on that person.
The only one.

1265
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.610
Just point out to the fact that that's,
that's a secret sauce.

1266
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:52.160
You'll see comics do this.
They'll go like,
look,
I don't even care dude.

1267
01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.950
You're making these people,
you're making them mad.
They're wasting their money.

1268
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.460
So and then the audience bicycle.
Yeah,
yeah.
Fuck this guy.

1269
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.710
Well some people think that they could do comedy and so that's why they do it.

1270
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.760
You said it before,
it's like we make it look easy.
If you're a good comic,

1271
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.760
you're making it look like it's off the cuff it,
you're rolling with the punches.

1272
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:09.440
Just talking.
You're just talking up there.

1273
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:13.490
And then some other guy who maybe is very funny might be the funniest of his

1274
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:15.140
friends.
Right?
Which to be honest with you,

1275
01:09:15.141 --> 01:09:16.760
that's all you need to start doing comedy.

1276
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:20.120
He should maybe go sign up for an open mic.
More power to him.
Exactly.

1277
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.650
But he goes,
Oh shit,
this is easy.
He sees everyone laughing.
You Go,

1278
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.120
I remember when I was in high school,
I would make everyone laugh.

1279
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:27.170
That was an awesome feeling.

1280
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.370
And then they take that shot and once in a while it works in their favor and

1281
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:33.070
you'll look like a real asshole and you're right.

1282
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.440
That happened where somebody says something hilarious and you're like,
fuck dude,

1283
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:37.940
you gotta be laughing at it.
You Go,
yeah,

1284
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:41.930
but then then the problem is it encourages more people and then people get drunk

1285
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.750
and then as the night goes on like some,
there's always some dummy.

1286
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:47.450
He's been holding onto this idea.
He's going to heckle you about something.

1287
01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:51.500
He's got it in his head for like 10 minutes and finally blood blurts it out.

1288
01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:56.420
You're like what?
You were holding onto that for all that time?
Yeah,
it's fucking,

1289
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.860
it's a hard thing to do to make it,

1290
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:02.030
to make a group of people after the exact same time that are expecting the
laugh.

1291
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.250
That is a very specifically,
it's also a weird thing.

1292
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.990
I feel like an alien saw us doing comedy.

1293
01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:09.060
They just fucking blow up the comedy club.
Like this is crazy.
This is like the,

1294
01:10:09.061 --> 01:10:12.320
I don't know what it is.
It would stop us from killing all the fish first.

1295
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.280
The first thing they do though,
hey,
how many fish you guys going to eat?

1296
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:22.400
There's no fish left,
dude.
We keep going.

1297
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:24.650
I joke around about this all the time because it kind of,

1298
01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:27.470
it's one of the things that freaked me out more than anything about what people

1299
01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:30.850
do on the planet.
Suck fish.
Ocean did.

1300
01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:35.860
I've watched countless hours of commercial fishing nets pulling gigantic halls

1301
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:42.300
of fish into their boats.
And you're like,
how many,
how,
how many souls?

1302
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:47.650
How many souls are in that fucking net a fish fan now I don't think humans have

1303
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:51.290
souls.
So fish don't even take care of their babies man.
Like one,

1304
01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:55.130
one or two fish too.
Some of them hold their babies in their mouth,
but fish,
they,

1305
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:59.240
they just shit out.
Some eggs,
male comes over jizzum the eggs.

1306
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:03.290
It's like they have such a minimal connection cause they know their time is

1307
01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:05.780
short.
How,
what's likely they're not going to survive.

1308
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.610
What's the life span of a fish if they make it?

1309
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.630
It's a good question that I'm sure it varies.
Sharks,
sharks,

1310
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:14.860
sharks and whales a long time.
Um,

1311
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:18.420
let's say a grouper,
that's a giant ass fish.

1312
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:21.570
How old is an old group or I want to say 30.

1313
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:26.040
That old you made it look to you and to start with like ocean fish?
No,

1314
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:29.550
let's go with Groupon.
Cause groupers a gigantic ocean fish.

1315
01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.360
They go get hundred days or 30 years.
There's such a differentiation.

1316
01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:37.710
What the answer could be.
It's definitely years,
30 years,

1317
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.270
30 Ooh,
feel fill Rogan.
Holy Shit.
Total guests.

1318
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:46.260
Total gas.
Yeah,
that makes sense though.
Like a deer,
a deer lives.

1319
01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:48.120
Like if everything goes perfect,

1320
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:52.680
a deer live like 15 years and then they get jacked by something usually to Joe

1321
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.470
Rogan.
Now giant turtles have like almost,
yeah,

1322
01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:01.110
they're all muscle model.
Yeah.
They don't even know how old those fuckers are.

1323
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.860
Yeah.
They could be a thousand years old.
Right?
Isn't it the case?
Really?

1324
01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:07.770
Something crazy like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think a giant turtle can live.

1325
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.160
We should probably go with that.
I've tried to look by before.
I don't think that,

1326
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.870
I don't know how,
you know like fucking kill it to test.
You used to do on boats,

1327
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:20.280
man.
They used to to fill the hall like the bottom of the boat with turtles,

1328
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:23.550
they take the turtles in the flip them on their back because they'll live down

1329
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:28.440
there for months on their back because they don't really have to eat all the

1330
01:12:28.441 --> 01:12:30.900
time.
And that's how they would use,
they use him for food.

1331
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:33.000
So they would have all these turtles,

1332
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:36.390
live turtles and they were still alive so they weren't riding what?

1333
01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:39.570
They couldn't do Jack Shit cause they were on their backs and so they would go

1334
01:12:39.571 --> 01:12:43.080
down there and pick them up,
take a turtle and bring it upstairs and cook it.

1335
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.120
Have you ever had turtle soup?
Yeah.
Good.
I think I have sent,
I said that why?

1336
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:50.700
When I was saying that I'm like are you lying?
I think I have.

1337
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:54.910
I think I had it once a long time ago.
I can't remember.
I didn't have,

1338
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.310
I was going to have it.
I was in Florida at one of these like frog legs.
Yeah.

1339
01:12:59.340 --> 01:12:59.830
Yeah.

1340
01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:02.880
It's like a place that it's like the best you want to have smell good or yeah.

1341
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:03.241
And it,
yeah,

1342
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:06.300
it's like alligator meat and like I tried alligator me at tried frog legs.

1343
01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:07.680
I don't,
I don't eat exotic shit.

1344
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.240
I've only tried alligator meat at like one of those Tgi Friday type joints.

1345
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.541
You know,

1346
01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:17.541
one of those like chain type and it was like deep fried batter fried and it

1347
01:13:18.601 --> 01:13:23.040
wasn't medically chicken chili chicken.
But apparently when they get it fresh,

1348
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:26.340
like if they shoot an alligator and then they take like the backstraps off of it

1349
01:13:26.341 --> 01:13:29.160
and they cook it correctly,
it's delicious apparently.

1350
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:32.610
But it's one of those things that like when you get it at a restaurant,

1351
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:35.150
unless it's like a legit restaurant,

1352
01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:38.940
like they're probably serve and you some frozen noncitizen alligator.
Fuck that.

1353
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.060
And how did,
how did they take care of it before they froze?
It mean?

1354
01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.770
Do you ever see those a swamp people shows where the boats filled with fucking

1355
01:13:46.771 --> 01:13:49.560
alligators.
I don't even think they're eating those man.
I think most of those,

1356
01:13:49.561 --> 01:13:53.700
they're just taking the skins off of them and selling it for the leather.
Yeah,

1357
01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:56.760
that's,
that's what's really valuable.
Yeah.
Dude,
I don't know.
I've,
I've no,

1358
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:58.320
no adventure in me.

1359
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:01.830
I want you posting videos of you hunting and killing things and then eating it.

1360
01:14:01.831 --> 01:14:04.860
It's like if you just go back to your,
your Instagram three days in a row,

1361
01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:06.010
it's like I go watch like a,

1362
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.710
an animal alive to being on your plate and it's fucking,
I mean,

1363
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.800
more power to you,
dude.
The whole,
I'm,
I'm,

1364
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.260
I watch it in awe because I could never,

1365
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.450
I could never kill something even in a even,

1366
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:19.060
I don't even definitely could kill something.
Listen to me.

1367
01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.970
You could kill something and you definitely could if you wanted to feed your
son,

1368
01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.920
there's no doubt in my mind.

1369
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.820
If you had a gun and there was a deer and you are hungry,
starving,
yes.

1370
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:28.960
You don't even have to be starving.

1371
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:32.760
You just have to have not the best prospecting or manifesting.

1372
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:36.160
Right now it's like 11:00 AM I'll fucking,
what is this,
Jamie?

1373
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:40.840
46 grams of protein and alligator.
Is that a pound?
3.3 ounces.
Holy Shit.

1374
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:45.490
Three ounces of alligator,
46 grams of protein.
You gainers out there.
Well,

1375
01:14:45.491 --> 01:14:48.730
of course,
it's a goddamn murderous dinosaur.
It's got no fat on it.

1376
01:14:48.731 --> 01:14:52.660
It's just muscle and rumps style skin.
They're monsters,
man.

1377
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.030
Terrifying that,
that story about like the like,
uh,

1378
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:58.660
that's the other thing about becoming a father that people don't tell you

1379
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:01.830
everything makes you terrified.
Oh yeah.
So you know the,

1380
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.230
so I'm supposed to read my kid to Disney in July and there was a story with the

1381
01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:08.060
alligator who grabbed the little kid and drag them into the,
uh,

1382
01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:12.610
on the property of Disney.
Yup.
The father just watched this kid get eaten,
Dude,

1383
01:15:12.611 --> 01:15:15.520
Florida,
there's too many alligators.
They can't keep track of them.

1384
01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:19.390
So if you have a body of water and you're not standing there 24,
seven,

1385
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:23.620
when the fucking spotlight and a rifle,
those cuts can sneak into that water.

1386
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.320
That's,
that's some real shit,
man.
Yeah.
He'll sneak into that water.

1387
01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:29.320
They'll cross that grass.
You don't know they're there.
They climate that water.

1388
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:32.650
You don't know they're there.
And they'll be underwater for an hour,
two hours,

1389
01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.950
and they'll pop the little head up.
They see that little kid and I'm like,

1390
01:15:34.951 --> 01:15:37.990
God damn,
I'm hungry.
That kids too close to the water and let's just grab them.

1391
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:41.410
They don't have any qualms about that.
They don't know what the fuck you are.

1392
01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:42.640
They don't care what you are.
Yeah.

1393
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:46.750
They have a brain the size of a god Damn Walnut and they've been alive in that

1394
01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:51.160
form for who knows how many fucking millions of years and they just kill,
kill,

1395
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.800
eat,
take.
They can go without food for a year,
man,

1396
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.310
really 95 alligators removed from Disney property in Orlando.

1397
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:01.540
Fos Toddler killed 95 that was just like in that last year.

1398
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:05.120
This was two years ago when this is written.
Dude,
they're too tiny.

1399
01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:07.630
Five up to 400 alligators through April.

1400
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:10.410
Like it's a project like they're building a fucking bridge,
bro.

1401
01:16:10.411 --> 01:16:13.540
We were there like a year ago and first of all,

1402
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.280
if you haven't gone to Disneyland,

1403
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:18.250
Disneyland has the dope is fucking writing the history of the world.

1404
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.480
Daddy World Avatar worlds is Lardo lands here world.
Sorry.

1405
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.980
Disney land.

1406
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.700
We'll have the dopest ride when they have this a Millennium Falcon rod that

1407
01:16:27.701 --> 01:16:30.310
opens up.
Supposedly it's insane,
but the,

1408
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:34.960
the Avatar ride in Disney world and Orlando is off the charts.

1409
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:38.740
It's crazy man.
It lets you know like,
oh my God,

1410
01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:40.540
the future of these fucking rides.

1411
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:45.760
It's like one of those like a reality where you see crazy shit and you're
moving.

1412
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:49.360
You put on this helmet and the helmet is a virtual reality.

1413
01:16:49.361 --> 01:16:53.110
Goggle straps you into this chair and this chair is like,

1414
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.700
it looks like a motorcycle and you look down and you were riding this dragon and

1415
01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:58.090
that's it.

1416
01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:02.560
And you go for this full HD three d environment that they keep getting better

1417
01:17:02.561 --> 01:17:06.080
and better if the shit,
I did the transformers,
I brought my kids to universal,
uh,

1418
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:09.380
last year.
That's a fun ride.
It was.
The transformers was awesome.

1419
01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:10.190
Harry Potter ride

1420
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.740
<v 3>was dope.
Love the Harry Potter Park.
You're like,</v>

1421
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:16.070
what in the fuck is that stupid fake dinosaur was the last year I think they

1422
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:19.220
fuck they got rid of it.
It's the last one.
More money on the ride.

1423
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:22.880
Then they did making the movie for Jurassic Park and it wasn't that good of a

1424
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:25.640
real,
yeah.
I ride that recently.
Come on.
Hundred

1425
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:32.300
impossible.
That's impossible.
I that fact it literally impossible.

1426
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:36.920
That ride is so old.
You got realize Chucky cheese technology and that ride.

1427
01:17:36.921 --> 01:17:41.420
It's a fucking animatronic Dicken re skin it and it would be a giant rat playing

1428
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:45.380
drums.
I know.
It's not even remotely scary.
It's like what will,
the drop is scary.

1429
01:17:45.381 --> 01:17:48.230
That's the thing.
At the end of it,
they do a drop at the end.
My son was five,

1430
01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:51.710
so he was terrified.
The Jurassic Park River adventure,

1431
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.940
$110 million.
God,

1432
01:17:53.941 --> 01:17:57.650
it remains the most expensive amusement park ride of all time and actually cost

1433
01:17:57.651 --> 01:17:59.600
twice as much as Jurassic Park.
The movie,

1434
01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:03.440
how would have guessed more than 55 whoever made that right now has a bottle of

1435
01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:04.100
champagne,

1436
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:08.920
one hand coke tray and the other and they just didn't live in The Bahamas and

1437
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:13.820
some shit.
Laughing about how they got $110 million to make the shitty ass ride.

1438
01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:17.720
Yeah,
they just live in like a baller.
It's a,
yeah,
it is.
It's a different,

1439
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:21.890
I mean like Jay z and big pimp and t do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do

1440
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.690
10 million that rides with $35 if that was at a county fair and be like,

1441
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:32.900
all right,
yes,
they will be the best writer at the county.
Fair.
Big Rod.

1442
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:35.810
It's big Rod.
You should see the dinosaur comes out.
Looks pretty good.
Yeah.

1443
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:39.000
Like he'd never slept bad fucking dinosaur.
I,
yeah,

1444
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:42.090
I got caught smoking weed at university aside.

1445
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.680
My girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park.

1446
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.240
I didn't get caught by the police,

1447
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.430
but I was outside of the Jurassic Park ride and I was like,
all right,
you know,

1448
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:51.980
bring him to go get a soda or whatever.

1449
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.580
I'm going to sit here and smoking my vape pen and a,

1450
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:55.880
there was like one of the handlers,

1451
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:58.010
they have a thing where they have a velociraptor,

1452
01:18:58.011 --> 01:18:59.340
it's like a person in a costume,
but it's again,

1453
01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:03.140
and I'm a charter costume and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and

1454
01:19:03.141 --> 01:19:05.780
the uh,
the trainers like trying to calm him down.

1455
01:19:05.781 --> 01:19:08.060
It's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited.

1456
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:11.450
So I'm just like kind of watching it,
like getting stone zoning out.

1457
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:15.740
And at one point the girls got like one of those,
you know,
a microphone,

1458
01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:19.040
face pieces on.
She just goes,
she goes,
sir,
not here.

1459
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:23.150
And that was it.
And I went up and then I just certain not here,

1460
01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:26.420
faded off into the distance.
I know.
I wonder if they're cooler about it now.

1461
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:30.890
Now this is a year ago.
Oh,
this not that long ago.
Wow.
I was very surprised.

1462
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:32.990
I was like,
this is California.
Well not only that,

1463
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:37.370
what would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed

1464
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:41.330
to do that?
Probably not.
I think there's smoking areas that are designated,

1465
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.621
but she knew what it was.

1466
01:19:42.621 --> 01:19:47.621
She saw my face and my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking

1467
01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:53.660
around.
I was losing my mind.
It was all to like get outta here.
Stoner.
Yeah.

1468
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:55.940
That was listening to the radio and Utah.

1469
01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.780
And they were talking about how they have to,
uh,
re,
uh,

1470
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.740
they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now because

1471
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:08.010
there's no reason for us to be some,
is there a change in Utah?
Is Utah changing

1472
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.660
<v 0>their,
uh,
their drug policy?</v>

1473
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.650
Because it was funny listening to this old dude on,
just for the,

1474
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:16.710
for the fuck of it all's Wilson,
the am radio talk radio.

1475
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.870
And this old dude was talking about how they,
uh,
they're,

1476
01:20:19.871 --> 01:20:23.310
they're going to decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs cause they'd use

1477
01:20:23.311 --> 01:20:25.530
them on like traffic stops and we go,

1478
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.000
medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines.

1479
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.060
Just fucking putting these dogs down.
Well,

1480
01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:36.410
they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs.

1481
01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:37.244
You're like,
you,

1482
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:41.790
when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah,

1483
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.990
you know,
first of all,
you realize God damn pod is really,
you can't stop.

1484
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:51.060
The genie's out of the bottle.
The revenues in grandma feels better.

1485
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:52.610
You know,
the,
the Alzheimer's,

1486
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:56.670
the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing arthritis

1487
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:57.504
patients.

1488
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.650
People with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that

1489
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:05.130
works the way cannabis does that just given in and then they're making all this

1490
01:21:05.131 --> 01:21:05.610
money,

1491
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:09.120
but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're

1492
01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:10.580
talking about it and they,

1493
01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:14.250
they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are going to go away.

1494
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:19.080
Right.
How many dogs are going to be,
it's not really my problem.

1495
01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.020
It's interesting to watch him look at it as an economic issue.

1496
01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:24.540
The problem is you have potheads that are leading the charge,

1497
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:28.930
so it's for a long time it was difficult to take him serious.
Yeah.
He needed,

1498
01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:32.070
he needed straight laced guys to come in and you know that there's a lot of

1499
01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:34.350
money there.
There's so much money in it that you're getting that,

1500
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:38.850
but when you have fucking hippies playing hacky sack and yeah,
you know,

1501
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:40.020
weren't pukka shell necklaces.

1502
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:43.200
It's sorta hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want it

1503
01:21:43.201 --> 01:21:47.130
to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know,

1504
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:51.780
yeah.
I don't like,
I don't,
I don't use,
we access doesn't try to do,
I do take CBD.

1505
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:56.640
I literally,
during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time.
Um,

1506
01:21:56.850 --> 01:22:01.350
so I guess take oral too.
I do,
I take CBD excellent daily,

1507
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:02.580
but I don't know,

1508
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:06.680
kind of infinite CBD sponsors our podcasts and I'm to festivals whether also,

1509
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.090
actually I'll get you a bunch of products because they're a really great company

1510
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:12.840
that supports comedy.
They sponsored my tour when I was preparing for my special,

1511
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:17.370
they're fucking dope.
But,
um,
I take it daily.
I take the oil.

1512
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.280
Um,
just because you know,

1513
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:24.150
apparently all of the benefits that it has with getting your body back into

1514
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:26.490
homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line.

1515
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:29.310
I don't know the fucking effects.
I smoke weed every day as well,

1516
01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:32.490
so I'm sure I'm getting CBD affects as well.
But in my mind I'm going,
well,

1517
01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:36.180
I have a bunch of this stuff.
I know that since I started taking it,

1518
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:39.180
I weirdly feel better,
but I can't really connect.

1519
01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:43.110
You said before you take CBD and you go into another realm.
Well,

1520
01:22:43.111 --> 01:22:48.090
I was taking one and one.
It's like one gram of CBD to one gram of THC.

1521
01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:52.330
Like it's a,
it's one part,
so whatever milligrams you have,
it's,
but like,

1522
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:56.490
it's 10 milligrams CBD,
it's 10 milligrams a week as well.
It's,
I,

1523
01:22:56.890 --> 01:23:00.420
I take regular CBD too though.
I take oil,
I feel like it's a,

1524
01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:04.530
it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory

1525
01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:06.040
benefits than just smoking

1526
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.270
<v 1>it.
Smoking it does something for you.
It definitely reduces inflammation,</v>

1527
01:23:10.271 --> 01:23:14.470
makes you feel better.
Taking sore joints.
Topical.
Topical is good too,

1528
01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:18.850
but I think the real combination is topical plus,
uh,
the oil,

1529
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.860
you don't have to take people.

1530
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:24.860
A lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one verse,

1531
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:29.910
one plus one,
like one part THC,
one part.
So it's like edible,
like,

1532
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:34.420
you know,
marijuana mixed with CBD.
A lot of people find great benefit in that.

1533
01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:39.010
For some reason I had to trick my aunt because my aunt Cille anti-drugs and if I

1534
01:23:39.011 --> 01:23:42.550
told her that CBD was derived from Hampshire,
she wouldn't take it.

1535
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:45.230
She has bad arthritis and I gave it to her for,
uh,

1536
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.920
for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact,
but it's grabbing to,

1537
01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:52.510
it's just a plant folks.
And,
and if you just get straight CBD,

1538
01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:54.370
it has no psychoactive properties.

1539
01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.210
That's the only thing that's going to do is for some folks and it works a little

1540
01:23:58.211 --> 01:24:01.840
bit less wave with me.
It'll alleviate some anxiety.
It just relaxes you.

1541
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:06.980
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
uh,
that's why I smoke weed too.
Yeah.
I smile.</v>

1542
01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:07.630
I've,

1543
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:12.630
I've been arrested probably 10 times in my life and every time was for smoking a

1544
01:24:13.981 --> 01:24:18.720
joint in the street.
Every single time.
Do they arrest you?
They take you in,
yeah.

1545
01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:23.580
New York talkie.
It's going to fucking sell.
It's crazy.
Still.

1546
01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:24.091
They're still doing,

1547
01:24:24.091 --> 01:24:28.620
the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago.

1548
01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:32.880
Me and Dave Smith two years ago,
maybe tell them you were Louis J.
Gomez.

1549
01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.160
I told him,
Louis Gomez,
that's when I started using the middle initial was like,

1550
01:24:35.161 --> 01:24:37.620
you know what?
It was problem.
I learned the lesson.

1551
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:40.860
Fucking Louis Gomez as much have rap sheets doggy.

1552
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.990
Every time I come back into the country I am pulled into a room and they
fucking,

1553
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:49.680
they look like they're about to fist fuck me with a rubber glove every time.

1554
01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.000
Have you been to Panama anytime recently sir?
Yeah.

1555
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:57.600
That's come right this way.
Every single time.
Bolivia sir.

1556
01:24:57.810 --> 01:25:02.760
But yet dude,
when in New York City,
the way it works is you,
it's did.
It sucks.
Oh,

1557
01:25:02.761 --> 01:25:03.511
it's happened so many times.

1558
01:25:03.511 --> 01:25:06.010
It's the worst cause it's just a major inconvenience.
You know,

1559
01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:07.500
pain in the ass to get into Canada.

1560
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:09.180
I can do it now because they changed the laws,

1561
01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:12.510
but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being

1562
01:25:12.511 --> 01:25:14.250
arrested for a joint.

1563
01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.010
We're not talking about like I have announced that I just bought from my dealer

1564
01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:20.700
and they found a large amount on me,
a joint smoking on the street.

1565
01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:24.150
What they do is they,
they at first they,

1566
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:27.900
they take the weed and the garbage is going to give you a ticket.

1567
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.480
Just hang tight,
relax.
We're going to put cuffs on you.

1568
01:25:30.481 --> 01:25:33.170
This is just to keep you calm and just to fucking get you in the patty wagon.

1569
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:35.790
It's all a process.
Then they put you in a patty wagon.

1570
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:40.110
They used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go

1571
01:25:40.111 --> 01:25:43.650
and try to find kids smoking weed,
drunk kids,
college kids,

1572
01:25:43.651 --> 01:25:48.030
pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick

1573
01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:51.510
up everybody in Phillip,
patty wagons and create criminals.

1574
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:54.150
Just create criminals that have teenagers.
You know,

1575
01:25:54.151 --> 01:25:55.050
Kay and they were targeting this,

1576
01:25:55.051 --> 01:25:57.030
why the stop and Frisk laws happening in New York.

1577
01:25:57.031 --> 01:26:00.720
They changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids cause

1578
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:02.520
they were like,
oh come here,
let me,
let me see what's in your pockets.

1579
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:04.160
Vastly numbers

1580
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.310
<v 1>of them being stopped and frisked versus white kids and everybody's got weed in</v>

1581
01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:10.610
their pocket in New York City.
Okay.
It's just so stupid that it's still illegal.

1582
01:26:10.611 --> 01:26:10.911
They're like,

1583
01:26:10.911 --> 01:26:14.030
how the fuck is that clinging on in one of the biggest cities in the world?

1584
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.570
How the fuck is that?
Still the same thing with the UFC.
It wasn't legal there.

1585
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:18.420
It was the last date.

1586
01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.550
It was the last state or maybe second to last and it's because corruption.
Yeah.

1587
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.440
The amount of red tape involved,

1588
01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:27.980
the amount of people that have to be paid off to make any laws happen in any

1589
01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.740
type of the fast way.
The UFC out wound up going to jail.

1590
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.640
One of the guys who was actively campaigned to keep the UFC out,

1591
01:26:34.641 --> 01:26:37.430
he went to jail for corruption.
Which guy was this?
I don't remember.
Fuck him.

1592
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.460
Yeah.
That was the whole dealt with that for a long time.
I didn't care.

1593
01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:45.260
I knew what it was,
man,
you know,
I used to live in New York.
I know what it is.

1594
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:48.740
There's a lot of that shit still around.
It's too big of a city.
Too much.

1595
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.070
Too many rats in the holes.
You know?

1596
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.390
You know when he wraps or in the streets of New York City,

1597
01:26:53.391 --> 01:26:56.810
just all throughout the bottom of the subway and running around the sewer
system,

1598
01:26:56.811 --> 01:27:00.150
this rats,
they just like,
they become a part of the ecosystem.
Well,

1599
01:27:00.151 --> 01:27:02.900
does human rats too.
It's like creepy,

1600
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:06.890
corrupt motherfuckers that had been manipulating shit and getting people to pay

1601
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:11.210
them off for protection and all sorts of sneaky fucking city related shit that

1602
01:27:11.211 --> 01:27:13.360
takes forever to clean out it,

1603
01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:17.450
just to get it out of the streets of New York.
It would take forever.

1604
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.090
They did a good job.
I mean they cleaned up times square.

1605
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:24.080
They've eliminated a lot of the mob,
but there's still a little mob killings.

1606
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:27.290
Right.
That guy just got some dude,
just got killed,
just got whacked.

1607
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:30.590
That happened and I was like,
what?
There's the mob.
The mob still alive.

1608
01:27:30.591 --> 01:27:34.740
Still alive.
They're out there has to whack and p.
No way.
I know I had,

1609
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:35.840
it was done.
I thought it was done.

1610
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:39.410
I literally thought it ended in like the 80s the Italian mob.
I had no idea.

1611
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:43.640
I thought so too.
Like fucking reality stars now.
Yeah,
right.

1612
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:48.040
I know like mob bosses,
wives still those fucking shows.
Grownup Gotti.

1613
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:50.930
That was one of them.
Whatever one where Liz lady was,

1614
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:53.730
I remember watching one with his girl was drinking and she,

1615
01:27:53.731 --> 01:27:57.980
she got mouthy with this guy and then the guy told her,
go fuck herself.

1616
01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:00.980
She's like,
Oh yeah.
And then she calls her ex husband rob who said mobster.

1617
01:28:00.981 --> 01:28:03.290
The ex husband comes over and talks to the guy.
I'm like,

1618
01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.570
imagine you're some poor guy at a bar.

1619
01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.650
And some crazy lady starts yelling shit out.
You'd go,
fuck you cunt.

1620
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:12.710
And she calls,
this guy comes over and you look in his eyes,
you know,

1621
01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:16.340
he's killed about 18 fucking people and you're like,
oh Jesus.
Yeah.

1622
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.400
<v 2>Yeah.
You got,
well that's the other thing is like,
you know,</v>

1623
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:24.560
when you go after a chick,
you gotta be ready to fight.
You got to,

1624
01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:28.340
if you're just calling some chicken fat con yeah.
That just,
just be ready.

1625
01:28:28.341 --> 01:28:29.900
Just whatever's gonna happen.
And,

1626
01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.320
and I feel bad cause the guy that she's with now,
he's like,
fuck,
fuck,

1627
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:38.130
now I've got to fight for this factor.
And I've seen it happen man.
Oh yeah.

1628
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:42.380
I had one,
we were at a UFC event in Philly years ago.
Forrest Griffin.

1629
01:28:42.381 --> 01:28:46.700
Anderson Silva.
Okay.
And,
uh,
there was a guy,

1630
01:28:46.701 --> 01:28:50.250
I was with a chick who was sorta dating,
she was a little Chubbier and we,

1631
01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.000
me and my buddies were there and these fucking Philly Dick as we're just ready

1632
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:57.590
for a fight dude,
back then,
dude,
jersey,
Philly,
there was always like seven,

1633
01:28:57.591 --> 01:28:59.870
eight fights in the crown.
It was like,
it was crazy.

1634
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:01.230
And these guys were just ready for a fight.

1635
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.320
And I remember she was like there and they were like right in front of us,

1636
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:07.710
but she was sort of in between us and the guy just said,
he was like,
yeah,

1637
01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.650
fuck you and fuck your girlfriend.

1638
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.400
And literally in that moment I'm like,
well,

1639
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:17.850
now I have to fight this guy because he,
I don't even like this girl really?

1640
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.130
So now it's like a,
but it's a,
it's a weird thing.

1641
01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.980
So I just pretended I didn't hear him.
I was like,
well,
that was,

1642
01:29:24.981 --> 01:29:26.970
it was kind of like scuffled and I was like,
that was that.
She was like,

1643
01:29:26.971 --> 01:29:29.980
did you hear what he said?
It was like,
no,
we told him,

1644
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:37.990
<v 1>yeah,
I have.
I've dated girls like that that will get in your head stopped.</v>

1645
01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.940
<v 2>She's like,
I'm going to get a hot dog.
I've had,</v>

1646
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.910
I've had girls that I've dated that would want you to fight for them,

1647
01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:48.650
not want they would just ladies and the ladies listening to the show.

1648
01:29:48.651 --> 01:29:50.870
All three or four ladies that are listening to this show right now.

1649
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.620
If just don't get your man into a fight.
Let him decide.

1650
01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:58.250
Don't start talking shit to another dude.
You're,

1651
01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.950
you're putting him in a situation that maybe he does want to be in and you're

1652
01:30:00.951 --> 01:30:03.860
never going to know whether or not he wants to be in that situation.

1653
01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.600
You're never gonna get the honest story.

1654
01:30:05.601 --> 01:30:08.000
What's going on in his fucking mind right there.
Just no,

1655
01:30:08.001 --> 01:30:11.120
we never want you to start talking shit to a dude in the middle of an

1656
01:30:11.121 --> 01:30:13.040
altercation cause it's never going to end good.

1657
01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:17.110
<v 1>No.
Most of the time,
most of the time does not end good.</v>

1658
01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:20.800
Especially if blows start flying,
man.
People getting knocked out.

1659
01:30:20.801 --> 01:30:23.530
Some guy got hurt really bad at a Dodgers game recently.

1660
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:26.020
He got knocked out and cracked his head off the ground.

1661
01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:28.420
That's what people need to understand.
People die from that shit.

1662
01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.380
Watch movies and people knock people out in the person's fine.
You know,

1663
01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:35.050
you could get a goddamn murder rap if you punch someone and they fall.

1664
01:30:35.051 --> 01:30:37.150
And most people,
when you punched him in the face that go unconscious,

1665
01:30:37.151 --> 01:30:39.550
they have no idea what happened.
They go unconscious,

1666
01:30:39.551 --> 01:30:43.660
their head bounces off the ground,
they die.
It happens all the time.
Kevin James,

1667
01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.570
when he was a kid,
when he was a bouncer in long island,

1668
01:30:46.571 --> 01:30:49.360
and one of the guys at the bar,
I don't think he was working that night,

1669
01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:52.420
but one of the guys he knew and worked with,
knock the guy out,
the guy fell,

1670
01:30:52.421 --> 01:30:56.200
hit his head off a curb,
dead guy,
went up to go,
going to jail for years,

1671
01:30:56.780 --> 01:31:01.100
spent years in jail at some fucking $10 an hour job or you fight fighting
drunks.

1672
01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:03.160
Just getting into some dumb fight,

1673
01:31:03.161 --> 01:31:05.650
which is thinking it's okay to just tee off on someone's face.

1674
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.940
That's also probably pretty rare.

1675
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:10.690
People falling and hitting their head and dying.
And that's not rare at all.

1676
01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:13.880
That's really common.
Think about what that is,
is said,
we saw somebody,

1677
01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.960
I've seen a lot of people get knocked out,
so I'm the wrong guy to ask,

1678
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:18.810
but I'm saying dying from hitting their head and occurred.

1679
01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:21.210
I haven't seen him die,
but they could easily,
if,

1680
01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:24.280
I mean I guarantee you in a major city like New York,

1681
01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.520
I bet somebody dies falling and hitting their head off the curb every week.

1682
01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:32.230
When you punch someone and they fall,
think about how far that is,
right?

1683
01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.660
Think about the amount of force that's involved.

1684
01:31:34.661 --> 01:31:37.600
Now think about if you were standing there and so when he hit you in the back of

1685
01:31:37.601 --> 01:31:41.530
the head with something,
now think about that.
Something was the fucking world.

1686
01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:42.520
The earth.

1687
01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.820
It doesn't give it all concrete doesn't give it all the only thing that gives

1688
01:31:45.821 --> 01:31:46.654
your head.
Yes,

1689
01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:51.610
you had asked a bounce and your skull fractures and you get internal bleeding.

1690
01:31:51.611 --> 01:31:55.630
Your brain hemorrhages,
it cuts off your ability to move.
You might have a stroke,

1691
01:31:55.690 --> 01:32:00.100
it might have.
I mean,
it's horrible.
Getting knocked out,
falling and hitting

1692
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.440
<v 3>your head off the ground is a terrifying thing.</v>

1693
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:07.060
And when you hear the sound of smack of someone's head bouncing off the
concrete,

1694
01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:11.890
it's,
it's t it sounds hollow.
That sounds like a look.
A like a melon.

1695
01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.580
It sounds terrible.
Like a hard melon or something like that.
Yeah.

1696
01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.570
You see it happen.
Um,
where people will pass out,

1697
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:20.790
there's like videos that are out there,

1698
01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:23.120
there's like fall over and then they just split their head open.

1699
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.070
What's the worst dude?
Gruesome?
Falling backwards though is something,

1700
01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:30.040
especially when you get hit,
you get fucking clipped on the chin,

1701
01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:33.910
your head snaps and you light shut off and you just fall and bounce.

1702
01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.800
It's even in boxing matches men.

1703
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:40.090
So miscarries knockouts when a guy gets k out and then his head bounces off the

1704
01:32:40.091 --> 01:32:41.950
ground and MMA and the UFC,

1705
01:32:41.951 --> 01:32:44.980
same thing when guys fall back and their head bounced off the ground.

1706
01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.280
It's like a double knockout.

1707
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:49.660
I watched that fight science thing back in the day they were doing on spike TV

1708
01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.100
and it was like a show called,

1709
01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:55.510
I think it was called fight science and they were just explaining why ground and

1710
01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:59.290
pound was so much more brutal than a straight up standing punch and they were

1711
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:00.130
just,
they like,
you know,

1712
01:33:00.131 --> 01:33:04.480
they showed the 3-d animation of the head and the fist coming down and then the

1713
01:33:04.481 --> 01:33:07.780
head bouncing off the mat and then the brain bouncing off the front,

1714
01:33:07.781 --> 01:33:08.740
then bouncing to the back.

1715
01:33:08.741 --> 01:33:12.160
Then the fist comes back up again and your brand is just being over and over

1716
01:33:12.161 --> 01:33:14.860
again and you can't go anywhere you're stuck on.
It's terrifying.

1717
01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:19.900
I got beat up in the sixth grade by an African kid named Bubba tune day and this

1718
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:23.710
every day 153 people in the United States die from injuries and include

1719
01:33:23.711 --> 01:33:26.700
traumatic brain injury.
What?
Wait a minute though.
Okay.

1720
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:29.200
That include traumatic brain injury,

1721
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:32.440
so it's an injury that also has traumatic brain injury,
head injury.

1722
01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:36.180
I see what they're saying.
Those who survive a Tbi can face effects.

1723
01:33:36.181 --> 01:33:39.040
It lasts a few days or the rest of their lives.
That's the other thing.

1724
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:43.360
Impaired thinking or memory movements,
sensation,
vision,
emotional functioning,

1725
01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:44.950
personality changes or depression.

1726
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:48.510
These issues not only affect individuals can have lasting effects on families.

1727
01:33:48.511 --> 01:33:52.900
The community.
Well that's,
yeah.
Um,
yeah man,
don't,
don't get hit in the head.

1728
01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:56.230
Don't avoid it.
Yeah.
Take it for somebody that has been hitting the head.

1729
01:33:56.290 --> 01:34:00.440
Avoid it.
Yeah.
I uh,
whenever with my son cause there's just like a lot of,

1730
01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.920
there's a weird thing in New York as well where there's like a lot of tough guys

1731
01:34:02.921 --> 01:34:06.700
that it's like this Alpha energy we will get on the subway and there's another

1732
01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:09.370
dude who like make eye contact with you and then you're like,

1733
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:12.610
weirdly like you're in a weird beef now cause you're just looking at a dude in

1734
01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:15.490
the eyes.
Yeah.
And it's in that,

1735
01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:18.300
and then it becomes a thing where you have to like look away when you're,

1736
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:20.470
you have this internal struggle.
We're going like,
well no I don't,

1737
01:34:20.471 --> 01:34:24.460
I'm not going to look away because this guy's looking at me.
And then,

1738
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.040
and then I looked down at my kids right there and I'm going like,

1739
01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:28.690
what is even going on in my head right now?

1740
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:32.650
I need to just go to another subway car.
Just avoid at all costs.

1741
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:36.250
Having to get into a confrontation in front of him because that's one of my

1742
01:34:36.251 --> 01:34:39.220
biggest fears in the world is not knowing what to do.

1743
01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:42.460
This people that live in like Montana that are listening to this right now,

1744
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:44.440
they're like,
what the fuck are you talking about?
Look,

1745
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:47.710
you look each other in the eye and some wants to fight for no reason.

1746
01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:52.350
This is the nature of being penned up that many people I was fucking does

1747
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.500
something cool about it.

1748
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.380
The cool thing we talked about before that people were like,
you are exposed.

1749
01:34:57.381 --> 01:34:59.830
Even if you're a poor kid,
you're exposed to rich people.
They're there,

1750
01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:03.650
they're normal Nike,
the,
it doesn't seem unattainable,
unreachable.

1751
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:06.860
They're all around you.
The Path is there.
Well,
there are humans that are,

1752
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.450
they're just like you.
You're around them.

1753
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.970
But if you live in a place where there you're never around them,

1754
01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.390
you'd never get that.
So there's benefits to New York for sure.

1755
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:17.450
Culturally there's benefits.
The just the,

1756
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:20.870
just the energy of the city and so much creativity,
so much going on.

1757
01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:22.430
It's even beyond just the money thing.

1758
01:35:22.431 --> 01:35:25.850
It is that the creativity por portion where like literally everybody,

1759
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:30.980
everybody that's in New York is trying to do something.
Yes.
They're all,

1760
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:34.040
they're all trying to make something happen.
Whether they're,
you know,

1761
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:35.650
if they're trying to become a banker,

1762
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.940
they're trying to become the number one fucking banker in the country.

1763
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:42.620
They're trying to become the best at that.
Um,
and that,
that energy of success,

1764
01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:45.980
it's really,
that's really good.
And that's why I'm happy that I won on one level.

1765
01:35:45.981 --> 01:35:49.160
I'm happy I'm raising my kid in the city because of that.
And the other level,

1766
01:35:49.161 --> 01:35:52.010
it's like,
I want you to build a fucking tree house.
The tree house,

1767
01:35:52.011 --> 01:35:55.790
he can't go out of the house without somebody being right there.

1768
01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:57.650
Show him some shit on the weekends,

1769
01:35:57.651 --> 01:36:00.140
take him places and the weekends where it could be around the woods so you could

1770
01:36:00.141 --> 01:36:02.930
get like the best of both worlds.
There's definitely a,

1771
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:06.350
there's a benefit to being in a city where you're a kid or an adult.

1772
01:36:06.351 --> 01:36:07.400
There's definitely a benefit.

1773
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:11.600
The negative part is this depreciation of,

1774
01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.930
of value of life people,
there's so many people,

1775
01:36:14.931 --> 01:36:17.310
you don't think of them as being as important.
They're,

1776
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:21.020
they're a hindrance as much as they are like a nice thing to see.

1777
01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:23.270
There's so many homeless people too.

1778
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:28.630
And there's a homeless woman who basically stands on my corner and just begs for

1779
01:36:30.081 --> 01:36:34.640
change every day.
Um,
and my son was with me the other day and this woman,

1780
01:36:34.641 --> 01:36:38.230
she's like,
Hey,
do you have any money for a sandwich?
And a,
I was like,
no,

1781
01:36:38.231 --> 01:36:40.910
I saw it on today and I keep on walking and I might not look down my son.

1782
01:36:40.911 --> 01:36:45.140
He's like,
that's really sad.
She doesn't have money for a sandwich.
And I'm like,

1783
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.740
she has every fucking day jams every day.
She has.
Okay,
I can't.

1784
01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:52.970
And I'd explained to him,
I was like,
I was like,
well,
you know,
look,

1785
01:36:52.971 --> 01:36:55.460
I can't give her money every single day.
And I was like,

1786
01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:56.990
you know when I do have a dollar though,
I was like,

1787
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:59.870
why don't we go back and give her a dollar?
And then it was like,
no,
I get it now.

1788
01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:04.700
We've walked at,
I swear to God,
he stopped me from giving her the dollar.
Well,

1789
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:09.760
if the world was just one,
there was only one person like that.

1790
01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:14.310
That was the only issue.
Just one lady.
Just need some help.
You'd be,
oh,

1791
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.230
we'll just help her.
Yeah.
But when there's a million of them,
you're like,

1792
01:37:18.231 --> 01:37:20.870
why can't help ever,
I just can't do this.
I got to keep going.

1793
01:37:20.871 --> 01:37:22.880
I've got to concentrate on my own shit.
Yeah.
That's like,

1794
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:27.320
that's a microcosm of what happens in a city.
If that lady was in a small town,

1795
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:29.450
she would be the,
the crazy beggar lady.

1796
01:37:29.451 --> 01:37:33.300
People would probably like figure out a way to help her cans or something.
Yeah.

1797
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:36.860
Some people does.
A problem is,
is just like humans.

1798
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:41.030
Some humans when you give them that as an option,
just begging,

1799
01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.670
like there's guys who do it and there was a whole San Francisco and I lived in

1800
01:37:43.671 --> 01:37:44.150
San Francisco.

1801
01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:47.210
There was a news report thing about this guy who was doing it for a living and

1802
01:37:47.211 --> 01:37:49.010
he was making a lot of money,
a lot of money.

1803
01:37:49.011 --> 01:37:51.860
Now he's just begging and he was essentially saying there's nothing wrong with

1804
01:37:51.861 --> 01:37:53.840
it.
It's totally legal.
And uh,

1805
01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:57.570
I just make up stories and have people donate money to me.

1806
01:37:57.571 --> 01:38:00.810
And I think of it as like an occupation.
So he,

1807
01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:05.811
it was weird listening to him talk about it cause he was telling this lady who

1808
01:38:05.821 --> 01:38:06.850
was a,
the reporter lid,

1809
01:38:06.851 --> 01:38:10.650
he was telling her how she could do it too and you know how he was doing it and

1810
01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:13.110
how it shows people how to do it.

1811
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:17.460
But he was making like a decent living,
like 100 bucks a day.
Yeah,
I'm sure.

1812
01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:19.650
I don't remember cause I was a kid,
but I remember listening like,

1813
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:23.670
Oh this is mother fucker.
He's just faking it.
I don't,
in a weird way,
I,

1814
01:38:24.090 --> 01:38:28.740
I appreciate the hustle.
I don't look,
I watched my mom on welfare.

1815
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:32.070
I remember as a kid watching my mom collected welfare check and sitting in the

1816
01:38:32.071 --> 01:38:35.070
room smoke cigarettes and not work.
And I remember as a little kid being like,

1817
01:38:35.071 --> 01:38:37.890
that's not right.
I was like,
what are you doing?
Just work.
Do something else.

1818
01:38:37.891 --> 01:38:41.490
We could be in a better situation just from way too young having that thought.

1819
01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.460
Right.
Um,
but in a weird way,
I,

1820
01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:50.190
I appreciate the guys hustle.
He's figured out a way to thrive sorta.

1821
01:38:50.850 --> 01:38:54.060
It's not nothing to be proud of,
you know,
he shouldn't be bragging about it,

1822
01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:57.340
but at the same time,
like it's just a different system.
It's a different game.
We,

1823
01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:01.650
if you disconnect from sort of like,
you know,
whatever,
we're,
you know,

1824
01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:04.380
he's a con artist.
There's not never a good thing.
Have it.

1825
01:39:04.381 --> 01:39:07.710
Someone who's lying to everybody all the time.
I appreciate it.
Good con artists.

1826
01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:11.520
I really do.
They're boring.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's boring.

1827
01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:15.960
It's boring.
Just figure it out.
Stupid.
Stopped lying.
Aren't they figured out?

1828
01:39:15.961 --> 01:39:19.170
Something different.
Dot.
They're just finding lemmings.
That's all they're doing.

1829
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.100
They're finding lemmings.

1830
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:21.890
They're finding people that don't know any better people that are,

1831
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.910
what's three card money?
Come on,
I'll show you.
Well,

1832
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:26.430
that's sort of what they deal with a homeless lady is doing.
There's now,
look,

1833
01:39:26.431 --> 01:39:30.510
I've been in New York City since 2001.
Um,
I've,

1834
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.760
I'm so desensitized to homeless people that I,

1835
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:35.560
there's no part of me that feels bad.
I just will walk on Sar.

1836
01:39:35.561 --> 01:39:39.030
Can't keep on going.
But what happens is you get there,

1837
01:39:39.031 --> 01:39:40.760
they're looking for the person who moved there a week ago.

1838
01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:41.700
They're looking for the tourist.

1839
01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:44.040
They're looking for the person who looking for Nice people and they're,
they're,

1840
01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:46.920
they're,
so,
it's sort of like that's,
but that's not the same thing.

1841
01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.640
Like that lady might just be crazy.
She's not a con artist.

1842
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:55.530
Con Artists are people lying and pretending to listen to my car broke down.
Um,

1843
01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:59.760
my wife and kid having anything to eat,
24 hours,
really in a bad situation,

1844
01:39:59.761 --> 01:40:00.600
I would never do this,

1845
01:40:00.601 --> 01:40:04.320
but I just ask you if you could just give me $5 and the guy says,
yeah,
man,
sure.

1846
01:40:04.321 --> 01:40:07.500
I'm sorry.
Here's $5.
Next person.
Hey Man,

1847
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.840
I need to go take this flight to see my mom.
She's dying of cancer.

1848
01:40:11.841 --> 01:40:15.330
They change it.
Usually they have sold and they'll change all the time.
Well,

1849
01:40:15.331 --> 01:40:18.510
I had a guy do that to me in New York when I first moved there and this guy,

1850
01:40:18.511 --> 01:40:21.750
he was wearing a suit,
young white guy wearing a suit and he was like,
dude,

1851
01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:24.780
I miss my bus back home was here for a job interview.
Um,
you know,

1852
01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:27.890
I'm just trying to get money for a bus ticket back home.
And I was like,
Oh,

1853
01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:30.510
here's a couple bucks,
whatever.
And then the next day,
and union square,

1854
01:40:30.511 --> 01:40:35.430
same fucking kids,
same suit,
same story.
Because they learn it like a sales pitch.

1855
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:38.100
So they know the beats of what they know exactly what to say.

1856
01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:40.080
You see it went on the subway.
When they get on the subway,

1857
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.810
they have an actual script,
you know,
so it's like,
you know,

1858
01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:45.750
I don't mean to bag out,
you know,
uh,
but my wife is blah,
blah blah.

1859
01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:49.020
And you see them every day going down the cart and it,

1860
01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.770
if you've ever done a sales job,
a good sales script is pretty good.

1861
01:40:52.771 --> 01:40:54.010
You're just sort of fishing,
you're playing the

1862
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.850
<v 0>numbers,
you're your,</v>

1863
01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.850
instead of sort of adding emotion to it and changing the story in doing all

1864
01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:00.040
these different things and putting too much thought into it,
you go,

1865
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:03.400
I'm just going to run the script and close one out of 20 people that walk by.

1866
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:05.590
Stupid.
Yeah.

1867
01:41:05.591 --> 01:41:09.640
No it's not only benefit is that you grow up around people that are full of Shit

1868
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:12.850
and you learn how to spot people that have full of shit so went benefit.

1869
01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:14.290
Other than that it's just annoying.

1870
01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.890
I agree with you but I also can appreciate it.
I can,

1871
01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:20.060
I can appreciate a good hustler.
I appreciate it.
It,

1872
01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.850
it goes out and gets a fucking job.

1873
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:26.110
You don't just lie to people everywhere with some stupid story about how you

1874
01:41:26.111 --> 01:41:30.610
missed your bus.
Can you shit together pussy stop mooching money from people.

1875
01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:35.320
That's gross.
Well what about,
what about a guy who sells his CD on the street?

1876
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:38.620
That's maybe a bit different cause he's offering something.
He has his art.

1877
01:41:39.170 --> 01:41:42.910
Nobody had a CD player,
you and a CD player.
I do not want up top.

1878
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:46.430
I got a refurbished laptop in Columbus.
You're sorta reminding me.

1879
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.980
I completely forgot about him.

1880
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:52.900
He wasn't known as the wrapping bum but or help us on the way 10 1520 years at

1881
01:41:52.901 --> 01:41:56.110
Ohio state and this guy would be on the high street,

1882
01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:58.330
which is like the main strip.
And he had this,

1883
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.700
all these rhymes he would constantly go to.

1884
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.940
It always ended with help us on the way.
But I don't remember a lot of them,

1885
01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:05.950
but he always said help is on the way.
And it like,

1886
01:42:05.951 --> 01:42:07.750
it was like this punchline like help is on the way.

1887
01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:09.820
He had tee shirts made about him.

1888
01:42:09.821 --> 01:42:14.110
I think keep someone actually recorded him at one point and like 2005 or six but

1889
01:42:14.210 --> 01:42:17.230
you remember when they found that homeless dude that had that crazy radio voice?

1890
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:20.260
Yeah,
that was in Columbus to,
was it?
Oh Yay.
I got a job.

1891
01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:25.720
Went right back to the pipe.
Yeah,
he fucked it up.
Well,
you can't fix,

1892
01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:29.770
you can't fix them.
Like that was fire though.
It's very good voice,

1893
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.500
great voice radio Voice.

1894
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.090
You got a lot of gigs too smooth and he just wound up going right back to being

1895
01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:40.780
a homeless person.
Right.
This is going to sound very insensitive,

1896
01:42:40.781 --> 01:42:44.950
but most of the time it's not bad luck.
Right.
You know,

1897
01:42:44.951 --> 01:42:48.430
it's sort of the decisions you make and I'm not saying that you can't have a bad

1898
01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:50.140
situation and you cannot,
you know,

1899
01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.320
there is bad luck in the sense that some people are born into,
you know,

1900
01:42:53.321 --> 01:42:58.060
affluent households and some people are born into poverty.
But this is him.
Yeah,

1901
01:42:58.061 --> 01:42:59.410
the same,
let's hear it.

1902
01:42:59.510 --> 01:43:00.890
<v 6>Nothing but the best of all these,</v>

1903
01:43:00.891 --> 01:43:05.210
you're listening to magic 98.9 thank you so much.

1904
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:08.230
God bless you.
He was a radio guy.

1905
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:11.150
Yeah.

1906
01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:14.210
And then he fell in hot oil and don't forget tomorrow morning is your chance to

1907
01:43:14.211 --> 01:43:17.790
win a pair of tickets to see this man live in concert.
I have a theory theory.

1908
01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:21.450
<v 0>I think doing that for living makes you fucking crazy.
That's what I think.</v>

1909
01:43:21.451 --> 01:43:24.750
I think if you have that fake voice,
eventually you just snap,
you know,

1910
01:43:24.751 --> 01:43:26.910
I can't do this anymore.
I can't talk like this.

1911
01:43:26.911 --> 01:43:31.330
I can't have this fake voice blow a fuse and that guy blew a fuse rotations.

1912
01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:35.520
Have you done that a lot in your career?
No.
I've voiced over a couple of things,

1913
01:43:35.521 --> 01:43:39.390
but not nothing serious.
It's such a weird like other hustle,

1914
01:43:39.391 --> 01:43:42.490
like you're like that's a whole world in comedy where like guys are everyday

1915
01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:46.500
going out and doing voiceover auditions and trying to be a voice in some

1916
01:43:46.501 --> 01:43:50.040
commercial.
There's so,
it's so disconnected from creativity,

1917
01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:52.930
like there's no part of everyone.
First of all coming.

1918
01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.820
I started reading these books on things you could do because this is before

1919
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:59.270
podcasting was even a thing and it was like you could do stand up,

1920
01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.590
you could try to get corporate gigs,

1921
01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:03.710
you could try to write jingles for commercials or write hallmark cards.

1922
01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:05.540
That was one of the things and one of these books,

1923
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:09.410
it was this chick who wrote all these books.
Oh,
I know Judy Brown.

1924
01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:12.680
Is that what it is?
You're so close.
It's not Judy Brown,
but your clothes,

1925
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:14.030
something like that.
Fuck yeah.

1926
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:18.070
So she wrote books on how to do stand up and it was workbooks.

1927
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:22.790
It was like hell's her name.
She's the one who did it.
Yeah,
yeah,

1928
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:23.870
yeah.
She had a bunch of them.

1929
01:44:23.871 --> 01:44:26.510
But there was no real evidence of her being good at comedy.
No.

1930
01:44:26.511 --> 01:44:31.310
None of them are good at comedy something.
How'd he just fuck,

1931
01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.230
there was a book.
Here's the deal for people listening.

1932
01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:35.630
Don't know what the fuck we're talking about.

1933
01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:39.200
There was literally no books on how to do standup.
There was no books.

1934
01:44:39.201 --> 01:44:43.160
There was a couple of books written by comics and they were almost always tongue

1935
01:44:43.161 --> 01:44:44.100
in cheek.
Like Belzer.

1936
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.570
Richard Belzer wrote a book on how to do stand up and just gave you some like

1937
01:44:47.571 --> 01:44:51.700
joke advice for the most part.
Carter,
Judy Carter.
Carter.
Yep.

1938
01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:55.070
So she wrote these books and how did you stand up and everybody bought those

1939
01:44:55.071 --> 01:44:57.750
books.
Everybody that wants to try to just stand up and bought those books.

1940
01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.510
Everyone,
even comedy greenroom stole a lot.
Just like on a shelf somewhere.

1941
01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:06.260
And they would give you like exercises,
so she'd be like,

1942
01:45:06.261 --> 01:45:10.010
go get a newspaper and write 10 premises out of the newspaper today.

1943
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:11.990
You know it's not.
Look,

1944
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.440
the reality is if you're not a funny person and you're still trying to pursue a

1945
01:45:15.441 --> 01:45:19.900
path in sand up,
that's not,
yeah,
there's nothing wrong with that shit.

1946
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:23.390
Shut that off.
Don't give her the time of day.

1947
01:45:24.190 --> 01:45:27.750
Fucking shitty quarter.
Maybe she's funny.
I'm just joking.
Impossible.

1948
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:29.450
So God damn sensitive these days.

1949
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:34.250
You'll find that that's like what we do honestly on a podcast,

1950
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:35.990
just in the realm of talking shit.

1951
01:45:36.190 --> 01:45:40.460
This is one of the last bastions of actual shit talking when we smoked weed,

1952
01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:45.380
you sit back and chill half like half the fight companion podcast that we do.

1953
01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:49.160
We want to be in completely blitzkrieg hammered by the time it's over.
Hell yeah,

1954
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:54.220
you're talking Shit live and there's non real time and put a microphone in front

1955
01:45:55.641 --> 01:45:58.220
of you for 10 hours a week.
You're going to say something stupid.

1956
01:45:58.221 --> 01:46:02.150
You're going to say a lot more stupid shit than I say.
Way More stupid shit.
Okay.

1957
01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.890
I'm done putting good point.
It's like what Patrice said is so pertinent.

1958
01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.320
It's so important that it all come from the same place.

1959
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.860
Whether it hits or misses.
Like when you just try to be funny,

1960
01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.990
you're just trying to be funny.
Like that's all you're trying to do.

1961
01:46:14.991 --> 01:46:17.180
You're not trying to hurt nobody.
And sometimes to be funny,

1962
01:46:17.181 --> 01:46:22.130
the funniest thing to say is the most fucked up thing or the thing that's making

1963
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:25.640
wa I says not trolls all the time.
Cause you know,

1964
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:29.660
people say mean shit about me on the Internet and um,
and I,
I go,
well no,

1965
01:46:29.661 --> 01:46:32.090
it's not about me.
That's the funniest thing to say in that moment.

1966
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:35.180
And they're trying to beat their comedy fans.
They're trying to be funny.

1967
01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:38.810
So when you step back and don't take us a personal,
you kind of go like,
oh,

1968
01:46:38.811 --> 01:46:41.360
I get why that's funny.
It also fits in with what you do.
Yeah.

1969
01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.370
And that's what you do.
So it's a,
it fits in there.

1970
01:46:43.371 --> 01:46:46.080
Jumping in when we lost balls then that's the,

1971
01:46:46.081 --> 01:46:50.040
I think you don't realize so legion of skanks.
Yeah.
I mean what the

1972
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.260
<v 3>fuck is anybody expecting from that name?
Well,</v>

1973
01:46:52.261 --> 01:46:53.280
that's why we don't get in trouble.

1974
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:57.270
I think if we called the most offensive podcasts on earth and we say,

1975
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:01.390
I mean the craziest shit you could possibly sound a podcast,
it's nuts.
It's,

1976
01:47:01.391 --> 01:47:04.380
it's actually it never going to get a network gig.
Now we deck,

1977
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:07.410
we've got a pilot deal with true TV last year.
That's a mistake by their part.

1978
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.720
We'd love that canceled.
He put the Kibosh on that bad boy.

1979
01:47:09.721 --> 01:47:13.500
Don't you worry that never made it to even filming day.

1980
01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:17.820
No,
we don't.
We don't need it with,
with the Internet today,
man.

1981
01:47:17.821 --> 01:47:19.980
You don't need anything.
No,
but you were not.
You're right.

1982
01:47:19.981 --> 01:47:21.540
We're never going to get a TV deal.

1983
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:24.310
I tell my agent you don't want it and then I told my agent,

1984
01:47:24.311 --> 01:47:27.360
stop sending me on acting gigs for ABC is going to happen.

1985
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:28.741
What are things going to happen?

1986
01:47:28.741 --> 01:47:32.640
I'm going to get a Gig and I'm going to get fired from it and then it's going to

1987
01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:35.740
put me in a suit.
Once you sort of open that can of worms,
you're of label it,

1988
01:47:35.741 --> 01:47:36.574
label the problem.

1989
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.320
I'd rather work with people that want to work with me and sort of get what I do.

1990
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:43.310
Well,
not only that,
do you really have aspirations to be an actor now?

1991
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:46.410
One of those stupid things they rope you into.
It's one of those stupid things.

1992
01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:47.790
They was wasting time.
Yeah,

1993
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:51.810
they broke you into it because he like Mitch Hedberg had a whole joke about it,

1994
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:55.170
but that comedy is one of the weird things that if you like do comedy,

1995
01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:57.930
they expected also act,
you know,
he had,

1996
01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:01.380
I forget the bit and it's another completely different,
different things.

1997
01:48:01.381 --> 01:48:05.850
Such a different thing.
I mean even on the like the like the cellular level,

1998
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:10.710
like how to start off acting as such a,
you go to technique classes and there's,

1999
01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:13.110
it's a real art.
I,
I really appreciate people who are good actors.

2000
01:48:13.111 --> 01:48:15.610
It is a majorly different thing.
Um,

2001
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.980
but for some reason they group them together like actor and comedian when it's

2002
01:48:19.981 --> 01:48:23.580
as different as hockey player and comedian.
Yeah,
it is.

2003
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:27.090
Well not really because if you can act,
you could be a comic.

2004
01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:32.220
If you can do comedy,
I think you can act.
I think it's possible.

2005
01:48:32.410 --> 01:48:35.550
It'd be impossible.
More likely.
If you do comedy,
you can act.

2006
01:48:35.551 --> 01:48:39.540
This might be my own bias.
More likely.
Do you want some weed?

2007
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:42.660
You don't have to roll it like a peasant.
Oh.
Rolson bleed.
I feel I bring it.

2008
01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:46.560
I'll bring some weed.
We can sponsored speed.
We'd as dropping off.

2009
01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:51.180
It's already rolled us chest.
I love,
Gina has a fucking man.

2010
01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.750
He's the best.
That war chest in the back.
That's all we'd dude,

2011
01:48:54.751 --> 01:48:58.830
we can get high for a year.
He was rubbing the boy.
I love it.
I'm talking about,

2012
01:48:58.831 --> 01:49:01.170
so I didn't really,
she smoked blunts too,
which is fucking dope.

2013
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:05.600
Where's the one that we just had?
Is it this go out?
No,
it wasn't different.

2014
01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.273
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

2015
01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.700
<v 3>W get one that's as fresh as possible.
That might be it.</v>

2016
01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:13.810
That last one might be it.

2017
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:18.250
<v 7>Oh hmm.
Hmm.</v>

2018
01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.970
<v 3>Wait one second ago.
You were like,
dude,
we got weed for days here.</v>

2019
01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.920
I'm fucking going through roaches
too.
Uh,
what's his face?

2020
01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:28.240
Um,
uh,

2021
01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.980
Action Bronson.
Oh yeah.
Actually brought,

2022
01:49:33.010 --> 01:49:35.610
he came in here and by the time the ashtray was done,

2023
01:49:35.611 --> 01:49:38.430
I had to take a picture of it.
Like this is ridiculous.
This is all his weed,

2024
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.200
like seven joints.
I mean blunt just kept,
got big ones.
Sticks,

2025
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:48.130
bats.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a pothead.

2026
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:49.330
<v 2>I'm a,
I'm a morning</v>

2027
01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:53.310
<v 1>dude.
Smoker.
I was saying,
I wrote,</v>

2028
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:59.370
I wrote last night at like one o'clock in the morning,
I took an edible,

2029
01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:05.100
gave the misses the business and then afterwards I,
uh,
I had,

2030
01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.320
I couldn't lay down,
I was laying down,
I was like mid die.

2031
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:09.480
All these ideas were rolling through my head and I'm like,

2032
01:50:09.481 --> 01:50:13.890
I know the right thing to do.
I got to get up and write.
And uh,

2033
01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.540
sometimes you write and just bullshit comes out and there's nothing there on

2034
01:50:18.541 --> 01:50:21.000
sometimes you,
right.
You just hit a vein man.

2035
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:25.280
Whether it's creativity,
vulnerability,

2036
01:50:25.281 --> 01:50:28.500
a live experiences,
thoughts,
recent things in the news,

2037
01:50:28.501 --> 01:50:30.300
everything just comes together.
Boom.

2038
01:50:30.301 --> 01:50:33.900
And then you have these ideas and then those ideas could eventually be bits.

2039
01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.050
That's like those moments when you get an idea,

2040
01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:40.450
you get the inspiration to write man.
As a comic,

2041
01:50:40.451 --> 01:50:42.300
it's one of the most important things that capture.

2042
01:50:42.630 --> 01:50:44.490
You've got to dive on those cause you'll,

2043
01:50:44.491 --> 01:50:47.130
you might have your next closing bit in that moment.

2044
01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.400
<v 2>It's such a hard,
that's where the difference between pros who are legitimately,</v>

2045
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:53.890
um,
who really care about the craft.

2046
01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:58.930
And guys like me who don't fucking,
I need to do it more.
I mean,

2047
01:50:58.931 --> 01:51:00.440
I,
I,
I,

2048
01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:03.130
this is the first time doing this special was the first time that I ever had to,

2049
01:51:03.131 --> 01:51:05.170
there was a purpose to doing Santa,
but was a fucking hobby.

2050
01:51:05.171 --> 01:51:07.240
Before there was nothing.
I wasn't working on anything.

2051
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:10.000
I was running a race for no reason.
There was nothing.
There was no,

2052
01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:12.070
it was doing bits.
You're just working on it forever.
You're like,

2053
01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:13.450
nobody's asking for this.
I'm not,

2054
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.590
I'm not doing late night sets are putting out an album.
Um,

2055
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:21.550
and all of those little habits that they're great.
Do you ever,
you put,

2056
01:51:21.551 --> 01:51:24.630
you can definitely know Gary Gulman who's a brilliant comic forever.

2057
01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.660
I'm sure we had lost too.

2058
01:51:26.190 --> 01:51:28.280
<v 1>Well God,
I didn't know him from Boston and met him out here.</v>

2059
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.030
I think I met him at the laughing.

2060
01:51:30.170 --> 01:51:31.820
<v 2>He's the fucking man,
but he's got on his Twitter.</v>

2061
01:51:31.821 --> 01:51:34.640
He does like a writing tip every day.
Oh beautiful.

2062
01:51:34.641 --> 01:51:36.830
And he's got these really cool writing tips for young comics.

2063
01:51:36.831 --> 01:51:40.530
If you're young comic,
you should go follow Gary Goldman cause he's great.
Um,

2064
01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.400
but he has these just little great little tips where it's like when you're

2065
01:51:43.401 --> 01:51:44.240
writing down your,

2066
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.050
your jokes leave a space between each line so then you can go in and fill in

2067
01:51:48.051 --> 01:51:51.320
different words later and it gets very specific like that.
Um,

2068
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:53.740
and I think putting in those little habits and just making it a,

2069
01:51:53.741 --> 01:51:55.460
a genuine rule where you say,

2070
01:51:55.461 --> 01:51:57.460
every morning I'm going to get up and I'm going to write for one hour,

2071
01:51:57.490 --> 01:52:00.940
I'm going to commit to that.
Whether I feel motivated or not.
Um,

2072
01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:04.160
you will eventually reap a lot of benefits.
And I think a lot,

2073
01:52:04.161 --> 01:52:07.170
when I started doing comedy,
it was like,
it wasn't our,
these,

2074
01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.970
<v 1>some of the most recent ones he did,
he spoke,
written wrong.</v>

2075
01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:15.770
Um,
but I fuck up spelling all the time.

2076
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:19.070
It's okay to bomb taking risks essentially.
Oh,
it's good for him.
There's also,

2077
01:52:19.071 --> 01:52:22.250
I think there's a Twitter called advice for writers.
That's interesting.

2078
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:26.810
Here's the number one thing though.
Here's number one,
right?
Just do it.

2079
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:29.750
Just get out there and make it happen.
Just start moving.

2080
01:52:30.230 --> 01:52:34.490
You got to force yourself to sit in front of a notepad or whatever it is for x

2081
01:52:34.491 --> 01:52:38.150
amount of time of day.
Have a fucking timer set it,
make sure you do it,

2082
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:41.810
and then if that timer goes off and you're still working,
keep going.
If you can,

2083
01:52:41.811 --> 01:52:43.730
if you feel it,
keep going,
but make yourself do it.

2084
01:52:43.731 --> 01:52:45.980
If you just make yourself do it,
that's more important than

2085
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.800
<v 3>anything else.
All that other stuff.
The other stuff is good.</v>

2086
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:50.780
It's all good to have structure and understanding,

2087
01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:53.870
but the number one thing people have a problem with is doing it.

2088
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:56.960
It's like talking about exercise but not exercising.
You know what I'm saying?

2089
01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:02.150
I think the other thing is with social media,
you have the tendency to say,
oh,

2090
01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:03.290
I'm going to just tweet this.

2091
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:06.770
And then you don't really work the joke the same way you would if you were

2092
01:53:06.771 --> 01:53:08.060
sitting down and trying to work a joke.

2093
01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:10.100
Cause you're trying to fit it into a certain amount of characters.

2094
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:13.280
You try to make it funny in a certain way when you're not going to get the

2095
01:53:13.281 --> 01:53:14.120
maximum.

2096
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:16.430
And that's where I think a problem where I have where my college and I'll just

2097
01:53:16.431 --> 01:53:20.930
go and tweet this or I'll put it on Instagram or whatever it is.
Um,
but yeah,

2098
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:22.610
I think,
uh,
that's another,

2099
01:53:22.611 --> 01:53:26.810
I think I'm sort of turning a corner now where I'm starting to look at that

2100
01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:31.130
process more.
That's fun too.
Men tweet jokes are great.
Nothing wrong with it.

2101
01:53:31.131 --> 01:53:34.430
A lot of people would become famous for having a really good Twitter account

2102
01:53:34.431 --> 01:53:36.830
when they say funny shit.
Nothing wrong with that.

2103
01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.390
But you've got to write for yourself,
man.

2104
01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:41.480
Like writing for yourself is everything.
It's everything.

2105
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:44.620
It's the one thing that we tend to fuck off on.
You know?

2106
01:53:44.650 --> 01:53:46.670
So one thing that I like to reinforce it.

2107
01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.350
So you're still listening back to sets and everything.

2108
01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:53.300
I listened to him in my car.
I have,
I'm a,
I listened to him on the way.
Um,

2109
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:56.510
if I'm working on some new shit,
try to say Oh yeah,
don't forget that part.
Oh,

2110
01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:59.180
make sure you pause there.
Make sure you may,

2111
01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:03.530
maybe if you emphasize this first punches right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2112
01:54:03.850 --> 01:54:07.190
It's like doing an extra set.
So like say if you do three sets a night,

2113
01:54:07.191 --> 01:54:10.160
but you record three sets a night and you listen to two sets of night,

2114
01:54:10.161 --> 01:54:11.320
now you did five sets a night.
Yeah.

2115
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:15.920
It is like it cause you're in that mindset maybe even more beneficial,

2116
01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.960
like not beneficial in terms of like,

2117
01:54:17.961 --> 01:54:21.080
you know that groove that you get in when you just loose onstage and

2118
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:24.110
everything's flowing.
Like the only way to get there I think,

2119
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:27.220
or the only way I know how to get there I should say is I have to do a lot of

2120
01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:28.870
stand up if I don't do a lot of standup.

2121
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:32.540
There's always this weird feeling of awkwardness that you have to overcome at

2122
01:54:32.541 --> 01:54:35.330
the beginning.
When you do a lot of stand up right away,

2123
01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:40.160
you can be loose and that is essential for getting the material across the best

2124
01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:40.994
way.

2125
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000
But you probably can get a lot of work done on top of that.

2126
01:54:46.581 --> 01:54:49.880
If you listen more,
a lot of guys don't like to listen to because that's gross.

2127
01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:53.930
Listen to yourself,
like shut up stupid Haley's,

2128
01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:56.330
you're so annoying and fake watching it back.

2129
01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:59.900
The special editing at myself with an editor obviously.

2130
01:54:59.901 --> 01:55:02.600
But you start to hate it and the more time you have with it,

2131
01:55:02.630 --> 01:55:05.230
you're taking more things out and you're noticing more things wrong.

2132
01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:09.380
You'll eventually whittle it down to nothing.
And I think,
look,

2133
01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:11.960
I think that's probably a good sign.
Uh,
you know,

2134
01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.970
my taste is a,
is better than I am as a comedian.
Like substantially.

2135
01:55:16.971 --> 01:55:21.050
Like I,
I have impeccable taste in comedy,
like the guys who I look up to,
Patrice,

2136
01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:24.680
David Towl,
you know,
these are the best of the best in my opinion.
Um,

2137
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:26.350
and you know,

2138
01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:31.380
that I sort of hold myself to that standard and I'll never be there in my mind

2139
01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:34.940
in a minute,
probably in most people's minds,
but I'll never fucking,
you know,

2140
01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:38.560
that those are the best.
Um,
and you start to hate it.
And that's a,

2141
01:55:38.630 --> 01:55:41.750
that's a very difficult,
painful process that I think most people,
most people,

2142
01:55:41.751 --> 01:55:43.920
even if you don't do stand up,
go listen back.

2143
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.720
<v 0>Anybody older,
listen to this.</v>

2144
01:55:45.721 --> 01:55:48.480
Think about when you put answering machine messages so you still do what we,

2145
01:55:48.481 --> 01:55:49.170
your voicemail,

2146
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:51.060
how many times did you go back and look where I sound like a fucking idiot.

2147
01:55:51.061 --> 01:55:54.030
And you delete it again and again and again and you've done it 30 times.

2148
01:55:54.570 --> 01:55:58.680
And yeah,
I think that's just sort of natural.
Yeah.
If you care about what you do,

2149
01:55:58.681 --> 01:56:01.770
you're going to hate it.
You know?
Uh,

2150
01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:04.290
Alexander Gustafson said something like that one.
So He's,

2151
01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:07.500
one of the UFC is top light heavyweights and he was talking about being a

2152
01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:11.370
professional fighter that as a professional athlete,
he was never satisfied.

2153
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.070
They still is never satisfied like nothing.
Nothing's ever good enough.

2154
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:19.020
And this is just the mindset that you have to be to be an elite athlete.

2155
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:24.210
And I think anything you really trying to do,
you're going to pick it apart.

2156
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:25.610
And as you're picking it apart,

2157
01:56:25.611 --> 01:56:28.770
you're gonna find stuff that you hate because still find stuff that you love to.

2158
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:31.020
This like the balance of doing too many sets.

2159
01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:34.880
You know when you do too many sets and you get stale,
you know flat.
Yeah.

2160
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:36.030
That's not good either.
Oh yeah.

2161
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:38.670
Well when you're just going through the same thing.
Yeah.

2162
01:56:38.671 --> 01:56:40.020
You know where the punches coming.

2163
01:56:40.021 --> 01:56:43.230
You feel like they now it's like you feel like they know that's part of it cause

2164
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:43.651
you know,

2165
01:56:43.651 --> 01:56:48.120
so it's hard for you to be in the moment cause it's like you've heard it too

2166
01:56:48.121 --> 01:56:51.660
many times so you don't want to say it again.
Well I think about this like,

2167
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.240
you know,
it must be crazy for you cause every show you do,

2168
01:56:54.241 --> 01:56:56.760
there's somebody that probably fucking followed you from the next city.

2169
01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:59.550
And Are you ever conscious that,
are you ever thinking like,
fuck dude,

2170
01:56:59.551 --> 01:57:04.110
I know that guy,
he saw this bit and it just for one dude,
for me,

2171
01:57:04.111 --> 01:57:05.580
one dude,
I'm like,
fuck that.
I want to do that.

2172
01:57:05.581 --> 01:57:09.720
But now we have kind of 250 people.
I'm like,
you know,
I don't want to do it.

2173
01:57:09.721 --> 01:57:13.320
And as I start saying it,
I'm,
I scan the crowd and I find his eyes and I'm like,

2174
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:16.290
I'm a fucking hack.
I stink.
I'm so bad.

2175
01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:19.530
But that's the process that you have to go through.

2176
01:57:19.590 --> 01:57:24.590
And you know that Stan hope yelled at a guide to stop coming and sitting in the

2177
01:57:24.661 --> 01:57:26.440
front row.
Like,
cause he was,

2178
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:29.160
he did a second show and the guy was there for the second show too,

2179
01:57:29.161 --> 01:57:32.520
in the same spot.
It's like,
what the fuck?
You can't do that.
Yeah.

2180
01:57:33.290 --> 01:57:34.910
It can definitely mess with your head.
It,

2181
01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:37.410
the illusion of you being in the moment,

2182
01:57:37.411 --> 01:57:39.090
talking about these subjects is out the window.

2183
01:57:39.091 --> 01:57:42.390
If someone saw you do it the exact same way,
three hours,
that's the magic trick.

2184
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:44.580
If you know the sleight of hand.
Yep.

2185
01:57:44.630 --> 01:57:46.830
It doesn't matter if you know what's going to happen.

2186
01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.260
You just see it every single time.
Yeah,

2187
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:51.240
but there's some people that love the process.

2188
01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:56.241
I met these two ladies in Austin that travel around the world listening to stand

2189
01:57:56.371 --> 01:58:01.230
up.
They went to cre in Iceland and I think they saw him in the UK too.

2190
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:05.790
They're like fans of awesome process of comedy and they said that they were at

2191
01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:10.750
the comedy store like a week before when I did a set there and then they came to

2192
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:12.750
the shows in Austin cause that's where they live.

2193
01:58:12.751 --> 01:58:17.220
But they travel around watching comedy and they wanted to talk about the process

2194
01:58:17.221 --> 01:58:17.461
of it.

2195
01:58:17.461 --> 01:58:20.730
It's really interesting cause then they'll get to see all these different sets.

2196
01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:24.060
They'll get to see sets where things don't go so great.
That sets,

2197
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:27.240
we switch it up and think you'll see that at the comedy store all the time.

2198
01:58:27.241 --> 01:58:30.570
There's people that go there like two or three nights a week.
Yeah,
they just,

2199
01:58:30.571 --> 01:58:31.320
they,
it's,

2200
01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:36.320
it's a rare art form where it one day will be seen by millions.

2201
01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:42.010
Right.
You put it on whatever you're on Hulu or iTunes or whatever the fuck it

2202
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.230
<v 3>is.
Netflix,
if you're on Netflix,</v>

2203
01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:47.020
you're going to be seen by millions of people like,

2204
01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:52.150
but 150 can watch practice and the same ones can watch you practice.

2205
01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:53.680
Awesome.
By the way.
Yeah,
it's awesome.

2206
01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:57.370
You mentioned watching George Saint Pierre train before or and being coachable.

2207
01:58:57.371 --> 01:58:58.750
I got to watch GSP.

2208
01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.910
I'm training with Henzel Gracie and John Donna her at Hanzo school in New York

2209
01:59:03.911 --> 01:59:06.670
City.
This is when I just started podcasting.
This is like nine years ago.

2210
01:59:06.671 --> 01:59:09.520
I used to do a show called Hammer fisting to beat to give people a,

2211
01:59:09.521 --> 01:59:14.521
that's like watching Herschel Walker play football or get coached,

2212
01:59:14.771 --> 01:59:18.550
like be on the field with him.
If you were a fan of football,
you're like,
wow,

2213
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:21.850
I'm right here.
I'm her about like as far as you guys are from me,

2214
01:59:21.851 --> 01:59:25.660
I'm watching them train.
I'm watching both of them give him like,

2215
01:59:25.661 --> 01:59:29.560
it was really cool.
It's a really,
really cool thing.
Um,
wait,

2216
01:59:29.561 --> 01:59:30.520
how do we even get there?
I'm sorry.

2217
01:59:30.521 --> 01:59:33.380
We're talking about him being coachable and him listening and you watched him

2218
01:59:33.381 --> 01:59:35.740
train with people.
How we even get to the George Saint Pierre.

2219
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:36.761
How'd it get back to there?

2220
01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:41.290
What we were talking about before that marijuana has pros and cons and here is

2221
01:59:41.291 --> 01:59:45.600
the car being able to watch it from the like the training process.
Right,

2222
01:59:45.610 --> 01:59:48.450
so we have with comedy it's like that.
Thank you Jamie fucking,

2223
01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:50.770
you don't get paid enough.
I don't know what you get paid,
but it's not enough.

2224
01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:54.940
The PR,
that process was an amazing thing to watch.

2225
01:59:54.970 --> 01:59:59.830
Now if I went to it and I paid $600 for a front row seat and I was like,

2226
01:59:59.831 --> 02:00:03.490
I'm watching a fight right now and I'm watching a George Saint Pierre Ufc

2227
02:00:03.491 --> 02:00:07.600
champion fight,
I would be vastly disappointed with that experience.
I would go,

2228
02:00:07.601 --> 02:00:09.610
this isn't,
this isn't what I'm paying for it.

2229
02:00:09.610 --> 02:00:10.930
I think when people come to comedy clubs,

2230
02:00:11.290 --> 02:00:14.230
they think they're paying for the big fight night,
the big fight.
Nice.

2231
02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:15.490
The special,
the big fight nights,

2232
02:00:15.491 --> 02:00:17.260
which you're the album you recording of whatever it is.

2233
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:20.410
Basically everything leading up to that with to a certain degree.

2234
02:00:20.411 --> 02:00:23.050
I think if you're headlining and there's a,
on the road doing an hour,

2235
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:24.370
there's a certain responsibility.

2236
02:00:24.371 --> 02:00:28.000
They're paying a heavy price ticket for a real show.
Um,

2237
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:29.650
but they should have a higher,

2238
02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:32.770
they should have at least a little bit of an understanding that they're watching

2239
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:36.400
the process and if they understood it,
they would appreciate it more.
You would,

2240
02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.610
they would go,
oh shit I get,
I even,
I heard this guy do that joke before.

2241
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:42.640
I noticed the nuance and I noticed the difference.
Some people,

2242
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.140
some people only want to hear the new shit,

2243
02:00:44.141 --> 02:00:46.800
but that's cool to just sit around and wait to die.

2244
02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:49.090
She used to just fucking do the hits.
How cool would that be?
Yeah.

2245
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:52.000
He used to get these to get angry.
If he didn't do the hits,

2246
02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.300
like they have a conceal,
I think they,

2247
02:00:54.301 --> 02:00:57.310
they start calling out hot pocket and it was like he'll do it.
He has to.

2248
02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:58.233
I think he has to.

2249
02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:01.760
I think Burt Chrysler has to tell the machine stores still write story.

2250
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:04.780
It's half the hour.
Does it need still tell that story?
I think,

2251
02:01:04.781 --> 02:01:07.360
I'm sure it tells a story.
I'm sure.
Well,
people will be mad.

2252
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:10.330
Bread is taken to taking his shirt off in the original room at the comedy store

2253
02:01:10.331 --> 02:01:14.740
as well.
It wasn't,
he would save the shirt off for the main room,

2254
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:18.910
but now he's taken to the next level.
So it's,
he takes his shirt off,

2255
02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:22.540
immediate said Starbucks and they're way too close to him so they all get

2256
02:01:22.541 --> 02:01:24.160
uncomfortable.
They're like,
what are you doing?

2257
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.280
I wish I was comfortable being that doggy.
If I,

2258
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:32.230
if I could be comfortable being fat,
I would be so happy because I was a fat kid,

2259
02:01:32.231 --> 02:01:35.710
grown up.
Then I got in really good shape in my mid to late twenties,

2260
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:39.350
got sort of eating right,
exercising,
got really into it.
Um,

2261
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:41.060
and now every winter I get fat.

2262
02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:45.470
Every summer I get back in shape and I just yo Yo back and forth.
Um,

2263
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:49.160
and cold weather life.
And it's a Europe's.
Yeah,
you're right.
It is because I,

2264
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:52.520
I don't want to sweat.
You don't,
you don't know Joe,
you never been a fat guy.

2265
02:01:52.521 --> 02:01:54.350
And I don't want to hear this horse shit or you were fat when you're in your

2266
02:01:54.490 --> 02:01:57.470
teenagers never fed.
Okay.
You don't know what it's like.

2267
02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:01.160
I don't know what it's walking upstairs and having your,
you could,

2268
02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:05.150
you could feel your ass sweating,
you could feel your thigh sticking together.

2269
02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:06.320
It's,

2270
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.740
it's just an uncomfortable life knowing that like if you're eating something in

2271
02:02:09.741 --> 02:02:13.850
public that there are other people that are health conscious looking at you and

2272
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:14.540
judging you.

2273
02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.810
And I know that because I've been on the other side because now when I watched

2274
02:02:16.811 --> 02:02:20.180
that people on the subway eating potato chips,
I'm like,
even if I'm fat,

2275
02:02:20.210 --> 02:02:22.100
I'm just like Ugh.
Put them away.
What are you doing?

2276
02:02:22.450 --> 02:02:24.910
Why are you killing yourself with that nonsense out?

2277
02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.700
They probably taste delicious.
Unbelievable in the moment,
right?
Some barbecue.

2278
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:33.320
What kind of,
what is that stuff?
When you get barbecue chips,
what his,
what?

2279
02:02:33.321 --> 02:02:35.870
His barbecue does not taste like barbecue.

2280
02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:40.490
It has a taste and that taste is barbecue potato chip tastes.
It's not barbecue,

2281
02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:44.270
orange dust,
whatever the flavor is.
Yeah,
great flavor.
It doesn't taste like,

2282
02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:45.893
but you know.

2283
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:51.130
But if someone gives you a basic gray bubble gum and be like,
oh this is great.

2284
02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:55.610
Like,
but it sits as a dealer like a grape.
Yeah,
that's true.
So true.

2285
02:02:56.090 --> 02:03:00.350
Orange Soda Kit pitch that is not orange.
Like what is that?

2286
02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:04.820
This is not the taste of orange and all this is is it's like an orange.
Yeah.

2287
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:09.050
I uh,
I do food.
It's so fucking bad,
dude.

2288
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:12.430
What is barbecue potato chips?
What the fuck is that taste?

2289
02:03:12.590 --> 02:03:15.550
Cause that's a weird taste,
right?
That does not taste like barbs.

2290
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.620
Not that I tell you this much.
It does not grow in the earth.
Whatever it is.

2291
02:03:18.621 --> 02:03:23.000
It's some long words and some scientific sounding shit.

2292
02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:28.001
Then methyl El Nino Mile Fisk gift pain should not be putting into your body.

2293
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.970
Oh,
there's gotta be some trans fats in them bitches to,
oh,
come on Joe.

2294
02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:36.110
It's 2019 you say that style is still out of say trans fats.

2295
02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:39.970
It's getting there though.
You can say Trans Trans is okay.
Don't,

2296
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:43.790
don't deviate with new sounds with your face and me and the exact same thing.

2297
02:03:43.791 --> 02:03:47.990
Or people get furious.
Trans fats are okay.
Trans Fat,
he'll get mad at you.

2298
02:03:47.991 --> 02:03:50.660
He'd say it too much.
Like,
do you just get off on saying trends?
It says,

2299
02:03:50.661 --> 02:03:50.971
when you say,

2300
02:03:50.971 --> 02:03:55.340
I'm trans fats and a lot of talk also trainings have great senses of humor.

2301
02:03:55.610 --> 02:03:57.680
If you've ever hung out a lot of them.
Well,
ever.

2302
02:03:57.681 --> 02:04:01.130
Every trans person that I know and I,
I'm friends with too,

2303
02:04:01.131 --> 02:04:05.750
that I'm pretty close with.
Um,
and I know a handful,
um,
get it.
Um,

2304
02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:10.910
and uh,
yeah,
they have great sense of humor.
Gay people have great sense of humor,

2305
02:04:10.911 --> 02:04:12.950
black people,
Hispanic people,
all the people,

2306
02:04:12.951 --> 02:04:16.370
all these protected groups have great senses of humor if you would,

2307
02:04:16.371 --> 02:04:18.860
to a black room and do racist jokes.

2308
02:04:18.861 --> 02:04:23.480
What would be deemed as racist jokes by young liberal white people.
They love it.

2309
02:04:23.481 --> 02:04:28.370
Dude.
They fucking bounce off the walls are having a blast.
It's all good jokes.

2310
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:33.110
Yes,
I,
yes,
but that's just,
but they're not typically getting offended,

2311
02:04:33.111 --> 02:04:34.580
but blew you offstage,
but they're not going like,

2312
02:04:34.581 --> 02:04:38.460
this person needs to lose their job.
I'm highly offended by these jokes.

2313
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:41.250
<v 0>Yeah,
I don't.
I never see that.</v>

2314
02:04:41.251 --> 02:04:46.080
I never see a black person or Hispanic person being the one actually complaining

2315
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.740
about something.
It's always some fucking annoying white chick.

2316
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:54.720
Some fucking barbecue chip fan.
What's in that stuff?

2317
02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:58.350
What does barbecue barbecue,
barbecue flavor like Paprika,

2318
02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:00.640
mesquite smoked flavor.
That's what it is.

2319
02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:05.400
Track garlic powder and the mount dextrose.
Dextrose.
That's a sugar,
right?

2320
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:09.630
Is that some kind of a sugar?
It is a weird acceptance.

2321
02:05:09.670 --> 02:05:14.550
The barbecue chip flavor.
We except that flavor.
It's great,

2322
02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:17.940
but it does not taste like fucking barbecue.
I never,

2323
02:05:17.941 --> 02:05:22.200
I would never go with a barbecue.
Barbecue chips.
I'll take him every time.

2324
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:24.660
Barbecues,
the only sauce,
it's that thick sauce.

2325
02:05:25.130 --> 02:05:30.130
Less sauce on [inaudible] for sure is sea salt and vinegar.

2326
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.810
If you want some potato chips,
I'll fuck up some sea salt and vinegar.

2327
02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:37.600
Salt and pepper.
That's good too.
It's not bad.
That's good too.

2328
02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:42.060
I get just salt and vinegar.
Almonds.
Ooh,
there was another fucking,

2329
02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:47.220
yeah.
Why Sea salt?
Why am I so pretentious?
I want myself from the ocean.

2330
02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:51.090
Sea Salt.
I don't know if I could taste the fucking difference.
Could you tell,

2331
02:05:51.091 --> 02:05:53.940
tell the difference with the regular soul?
I'd like to know if I can't not.

2332
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:58.440
I can't.
I Bet Himalayan salt tastes a little different maybe.

2333
02:05:59.130 --> 02:06:02.910
What do you think?
Probably right.
Probably look a little different.

2334
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:03.660
You could probably do it.

2335
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.430
You could probably taste the difference between all three of those.

2336
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:08.040
If you did a blind taste test I easily,
I bet I would.

2337
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:10.980
I would beg to disagree to it.
If you want to cook a steak,

2338
02:06:10.981 --> 02:06:13.920
especially a Ribeye and you don't have kosher salt,

2339
02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:16.680
you don't know what the fuck you're doing.
You want that thick ass.

2340
02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:20.940
What makes it kosher?
Salt that I dunno.
Is it actually kosher?
Jews use magic.

2341
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:25.620
The Jews are praying over it.
Weed.
It's weed,
Joe,

2342
02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:29.190
that I've killed like at least four laptops.

2343
02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.340
That's one of the reasons why I switched to a windows laptop.

2344
02:06:32.341 --> 02:06:36.360
I have all the Novo,
not just for the best keyboard,
but also because I'm,

2345
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:40.170
the fucking things are waterproof.

2346
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.660
Like how does apple not have waterproof computers?

2347
02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.420
You spill your coffee on your apple computer.
That shit is dead.
Well,

2348
02:06:46.421 --> 02:06:50.520
so the iPhone is not waterproof.
I've watched five friends go,
yeah,

2349
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:53.910
it's waterproof and there's Dunkin water and then it goes off coffee.

2350
02:06:53.911 --> 02:06:57.450
Kelly did that.
Uh,
my girlfriend did that.
We were in Jamaica.
She's like,

2351
02:06:57.451 --> 02:07:00.870
it's waterproof it and she started taking these photos of the waves coming up to

2352
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:05.460
the phone.
So it was like half in the water and half without us.
Oh my God.

2353
02:07:05.461 --> 02:07:09.840
That's it.
It's water resistant.
Yeah,
water resistant.
If it's raining,
it's fine.

2354
02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:13.400
And make sure you have the one that's water resistant.
Like you might not have.

2355
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.650
You might have an older model.
Like I have an iPhone thrown in the ocean,

2356
02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:23.100
but the fucking laptops,
they short out.
I've shorted out how many Jamie,

2357
02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:27.510
how many have I killed?
Five.
Six,
easily.

2358
02:07:27.550 --> 02:07:31.260
I went every six months at least killed four laptops.

2359
02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:34.920
One time I'm leading the skanks.
I was drinking red wine Lewis Chair Gomez.

2360
02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.380
Who is Jacob Lewis

2361
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:40.480
<v 3>Shaygo master.
Get a glass of red wine and I knocked it over.</v>

2362
02:07:40.481 --> 02:07:45.340
A big J.
Big Dad just bought a brand new pair of sneakers,
like $150 sneakers.

2363
02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:49.370
Jay's Jay's deep down inside.
He's trashed.
So he like,
you know,

2364
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:52.190
he needs expensive things and make himself feel good.
Um,

2365
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:56.650
but these were beautiful white sneakers.
Just got them and the wine,
it literally,

2366
02:07:56.651 --> 02:08:00.020
the entire glass fell into the laptop.
I mean literal.

2367
02:08:00.021 --> 02:08:03.870
All the liquid disappeared into the laptop.
Um,

2368
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:08.620
and one splash just went splat right on the front of the shoe.
Oh,

2369
02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:10.540
right on the front of red wine.
That's it.

2370
02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:15.500
And he couldn't be mad because my $1,600 laptop had just been destroyed.

2371
02:08:15.501 --> 02:08:17.410
He said he couldn't be like,
oh,
my hundred $50 shoes.

2372
02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:21.700
Why aren't laptops all fucking waterproof?
That's what I'm saying.

2373
02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:25.870
Like fix that stupid.
They just want to make a lot of money in repairs.

2374
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:28.270
Is that what that is?
Maybe planned obsolescence.

2375
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:32.890
They know people are going to be dumb.
Eventually Snapple.
Listen,
listen folks,

2376
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:37.120
Steve Jobs is dead to make better keyboards.
Your keyboards are dog shit.

2377
02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:41.530
Also the volume on the uh,
the macbook air is garbage.
What do you say,
Jamie?

2378
02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:43.810
I just saw someone tweet about that today.
There's like a,

2379
02:08:43.811 --> 02:08:47.020
an article someone wrote apple doesn't like from their stance,

2380
02:08:47.021 --> 02:08:51.220
they don't buy that.
It's a big problem.
That keyboard issue.
Oh,
but their kids,

2381
02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:56.680
that's a breaking keyboard.
The keyboard suck.
Even if they work perfectly,

2382
02:08:57.070 --> 02:09:00.580
they suck for writing.
There's no,
there's no travel.

2383
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.820
It's a very short travel and they're flat like they don't,

2384
02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:07.180
it doesn't feel good for your hands.
I think you just get used to it.

2385
02:09:07.181 --> 02:09:09.940
That's what sort of stupid.
It shouldn't have to get used to it.

2386
02:09:10.090 --> 02:09:14.980
Like if you like a Lenovo keyboard is so much better today,
you know what it is.

2387
02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:18.940
I think their whole thing was Apple's sort of butterfly keyboard,

2388
02:09:18.941 --> 02:09:21.460
a personal journey.
The feel of it,
right?

2389
02:09:21.461 --> 02:09:24.360
It's what it feels very smooth when you touch,
you take an homeland box,

2390
02:09:24.370 --> 02:09:26.560
fuels how you,
what it is.
It's the way it looks.

2391
02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:29.350
They liked the fact that it looks really thin and really sleek.

2392
02:09:29.351 --> 02:09:32.290
So they made these keys as shallow as possible.

2393
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:36.430
So they just click it so everything's real small and it looks sleek as fuck.

2394
02:09:36.610 --> 02:09:39.310
That's what it is.
It's not for function.
If they had it function,

2395
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:42.550
that'd be like a little dip to the center of the key so your fingers would fit

2396
02:09:42.551 --> 02:09:46.900
in it normally and there would be some travel because when you have some travel

2397
02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:47.734
with your keys,

2398
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.830
then your fingers get a better sense of what you're doing and you're more

2399
02:09:50.831 --> 02:09:55.030
processing Italian or you need your hands moving around more better precision.

2400
02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:57.610
It's more precise whether or not you're touching something,

2401
02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:00.070
you get better feedback so you can type better.

2402
02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:02.380
But I'm showing him like words per minute when they show,

2403
02:10:02.381 --> 02:10:04.330
like people who are like really good typist,

2404
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.660
how many words per minute they can do with a really good keyboard versus a flat

2405
02:10:07.661 --> 02:10:08.530
shallow keyboard.

2406
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:13.450
Though even experienced like high level typist are way better with like

2407
02:10:13.451 --> 02:10:16.690
something that has some travel.
If I try to type on a regular keyboard right now,

2408
02:10:16.691 --> 02:10:20.350
it would feel like I,
it's an alien thing because I'm so used to it now.

2409
02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.790
I guess you can get used to it,
but I don't even mean like a regular keyboard,

2410
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:28.780
like just a let like a laptop keyboard.
It doesn't have to be like some crazy

2411
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:34.010
but just have enough extra travel.
There's a number,
they think

2412
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:38.060
<v 1>it is like 1.5 millimeters or something like that.
And they would like,</v>

2413
02:10:38.061 --> 02:10:41.120
like anything between 1.5 and two millimeters is good.

2414
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:45.230
You get that travel and you get a feeling of it and it's a lot of feedback.

2415
02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:47.030
Anything shorter than that as bad.

2416
02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:50.380
So you're saying it's actually a better riding experience,
your Phoebe?

2417
02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.140
It's easier.
It's easier to write like your fingers find the keys better.

2418
02:10:54.141 --> 02:10:57.380
I'm not a good typer but I'm half decent.
I don't look at the keys.

2419
02:10:58.430 --> 02:11:02.570
I've been love doing those.
Uh,
I did those Mavis Base Bacon teaches typing.

2420
02:11:02.571 --> 02:11:06.270
I did all those little courses or it's like a game that you play it?
No,

2421
02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.100
it's color.
It's really cool.
Like,
uh,
like they make it like a little game.

2422
02:11:10.101 --> 02:11:13.700
Like things will go across the screen and you have to type it with your finger

2423
02:11:13.701 --> 02:11:14.710
and it shows you like a,

2424
02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:18.620
a map of where your hands are in relationship to the keys and it shows you like

2425
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.920
where you should move your fingers and then there's something will pop up and

2426
02:11:21.921 --> 02:11:25.220
you're like,
oh,
that's an l,
here's an owl and you'll,
you'll start doing this.

2427
02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:28.460
And as you're doing this,
you get better and better.

2428
02:11:28.461 --> 02:11:31.700
And then they ask you to start forming sentences and after a while you get like

2429
02:11:31.701 --> 02:11:33.380
a really good sense of where the keys are.

2430
02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:35.920
<v 2>Yeah.
I almost felt that game guitar hero,</v>

2431
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:39.280
they should've made it with like a real guitar because I feel like they can

2432
02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:42.850
teach people guitar if they made it a game where they just started because you

2433
02:11:42.851 --> 02:11:44.680
just sort of like have to hit those beats in your finger,

2434
02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:46.800
starts getting used to it.
Um,

2435
02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:51.290
<v 1>I'm Jamie.
I was in typing class in the sixth grade thing I just discovered.</v>

2436
02:11:51.291 --> 02:11:52.124
It's called tap.

2437
02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:56.660
The little sensors you put on your fingers and you tap little gestures and it

2438
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:59.450
types for you so you don't need it.
You don't need a keyboard anymore.

2439
02:11:59.510 --> 02:12:03.350
What in the holy fuck?
I don't know if it would be useful.

2440
02:12:03.351 --> 02:12:05.260
I don't know if you'd like it.
I don't know if you could get used to it.

2441
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:07.280
It actually be better,
but it's going to suck right now.

2442
02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:10.340
Give me showing a five year looks like it's going to be God damn garbage right

2443
02:12:10.341 --> 02:12:13.640
now.
The technology sucks.
This is a Tom cruise movie.
Look at this,

2444
02:12:13.670 --> 02:12:16.520
this guy moving this stuff around with his fingers.
This is insane.

2445
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:21.530
Fuck.
It could be cool.
I mean you might,
you want tactile feedback I'm sure,

2446
02:12:21.531 --> 02:12:22.730
but like this thick,

2447
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:25.550
they could add a little bit of a vibration maybe and that could be enough.

2448
02:12:25.610 --> 02:12:26.120
I don't know.
Look,

2449
02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.500
it's entirely possible that these typers if you left them alone with one of

2450
02:12:30.501 --> 02:12:31.640
those shallow keyboards,

2451
02:12:31.641 --> 02:12:33.900
eventually they could get used to it and it would put their,

2452
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:37.820
their numbers of words per minute just back up to where it was before.

2453
02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:41.300
But for me it's an easier experience.

2454
02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.800
<v 2>I don't use any of this.</v>

2455
02:12:42.850 --> 02:12:46.720
The new technology like Alexa or those things.

2456
02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:51.840
That bitch is listening.
Oh,
oh yeah.
Oh,
it's crazy.
It's over it.
Whenever it,

2457
02:12:52.630 --> 02:12:56.020
I've sort of given up like all right guys,
you have an online profile.

2458
02:12:56.021 --> 02:12:59.560
Everything I type in is online.
Everything we say it's being picked up.

2459
02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:03.160
Stores are eventually going to have just Alexa and their own versions of

2460
02:13:03.161 --> 02:13:07.420
whatever that is where you just say it into the air and it's all listening and

2461
02:13:07.421 --> 02:13:11.860
it's all going into a database and you know,
I eventually,

2462
02:13:11.861 --> 02:13:14.650
I think what they're going to do is they're going to have a thought of the

2463
02:13:14.651 --> 02:13:18.280
technology to like go through podcasts and find the no,
no words.

2464
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:20.710
They'll have an algorithm to go back and start listening to what you're not

2465
02:13:20.711 --> 02:13:23.860
supposed to say.
It's all kicking old content off the Internet.
That's cool.

2466
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:27.430
That's very close to on the way guaranteed.
I'm sure.

2467
02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:32.510
<v 1>Yeah.
We're in the middle of a hurricane of new,
yeah,
no,</v>

2468
02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:37.390
I mean it's going to be really,
really interesting to see what these lean,

2469
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:42.230
the kinds of wearing virtual reality goggles typing on his arm.
Yeah.
What?

2470
02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:46.920
Moving things around some virtual desktop that's like straight out of a

2471
02:13:46.921 --> 02:13:51.200
futuristic film.
Right.
I,
uh,
I,

2472
02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:53.940
I'm interested to see where it's going to go.
That's minority report,
right?

2473
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.490
I mean,
minority report,
they didn't have glasses.

2474
02:13:56.491 --> 02:14:00.210
They just did it on the screen and we were like,
that is insane.
That is insane.

2475
02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:03.150
But that's like,
you know,
windows 13 or something.

2476
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:04.490
<v 0>Yeah.
It's actually not impressing anybody.</v>

2477
02:14:04.491 --> 02:14:06.430
What you've watched minority report now you're like,
okay,
it's a

2478
02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:10.730
<v 1>touchscreen.
Hey,
he needed all those um,
those psychics.
Yeah.
We need to be tough.</v>

2479
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:12.920
Yeah.
If you could have psychics,
I can predict crimes.

2480
02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:17.980
And what in the fuck kind of weird body slavery was that psychics strapped into

2481
02:14:18.591 --> 02:14:20.540
a tub all day.
Like what was that?

2482
02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:24.800
Is that what they want and how do they not see this coming that they're going to

2483
02:14:24.801 --> 02:14:28.890
get roped into being covered in milk and left in that pool?

2484
02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.640
<v 0>Like what the fuck was,
that was a weird fucking weird fucking movie.
Right?</v>

2485
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:35.280
Like they needed those people to figure out crime.
Right?

2486
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:37.080
Isn't that how they did it?
That was the idea.

2487
02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.580
But you didn't have free will anymore.

2488
02:14:38.581 --> 02:14:42.180
Like it was the idea that those people are like,
I forget where they special.

2489
02:14:42.181 --> 02:14:44.300
Like like x man type people.
He cogs,

2490
02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:50.190
they had magic powers.
But you,
yeah,
I guess the rust in the future like,
well,

2491
02:14:50.191 --> 02:14:53.480
why wouldn't you go to this guy and say don't commit the crime and then the date

2492
02:14:53.481 --> 02:14:56.080
passes,
he doesn't give it the crime and you say,
hey man,

2493
02:14:56.081 --> 02:14:58.890
and know you're going to go rob this bank and it's really gonna fuck up your

2494
02:14:58.891 --> 02:15:01.380
life and everybody else's life,
so don't go robbing the bank.

2495
02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:04.200
Does that have to get in a shootout with the cops?
Yeah,

2496
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:07.200
I was trying to find this little quick little video.
Have you seen this?

2497
02:15:07.890 --> 02:15:12.300
What the fuck is barbecue potato flavor?
This new Amazon store,

2498
02:15:12.301 --> 02:15:14.370
I don't know if these are a fully out yet,

2499
02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:15.750
but this is the way it's going to work.

2500
02:15:15.751 --> 02:15:19.740
Like this guy walks in and he scans his phone on like basically like a
turnstile.

2501
02:15:19.741 --> 02:15:22.830
Like you're walking into a subway that sort of lets the store know you're there

2502
02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:26.290
and you don't pay for anything.
Oh,
you walk out,
walk out,
boom.

2503
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:30.180
It's sort of knows what
charges you off of your account.

2504
02:15:30.181 --> 02:15:33.690
And this is what's going to happen for everyone who wants a minimum wage raised.

2505
02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:38.190
This is common guys.
Nobody's going to be working in these places.
This is weird.

2506
02:15:38.610 --> 02:15:42.650
They're gonna eliminate shoplifting.
This is a weird looking.

2507
02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:46.350
Everything in plastic like that freaks me out.
I feel like we're in a movie.

2508
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.600
There's a couple of grocery stores like that here already.

2509
02:15:48.601 --> 02:15:50.700
I don't know if you're just saying,
what's the airport?
You don't,

2510
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:52.080
you don't even deal with people anymore.

2511
02:15:52.081 --> 02:15:54.510
You just go up and you can pick it up and you scan it out yourself.

2512
02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.840
<v 1>Well.
Um,
Andrew Yang,
who's running for president on this,
um,</v>

2513
02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:05.260
universal basic income idea is one of the things he's doing this for is to

2514
02:16:05.811 --> 02:16:09.710
educate people.
The fact that all these jobs are going away,

2515
02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.150
automation is going to take over many,
many millions of jobs in this country.

2516
02:16:14.151 --> 02:16:18.260
And we have to be prepared for all these people essentially being,

2517
02:16:19.130 --> 02:16:22.760
you know,
uh,
technology's removed them from the workforce.
They don't,

2518
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:25.810
they're not needed anymore.
So then they have to figure out what,
you know,

2519
02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:30.160
what do I do next?
And then universal basic income,
he will be the bridge

2520
02:16:30.460 --> 02:16:31.910
<v 3>to what is universal.
Basically.</v>

2521
02:16:31.911 --> 02:16:34.930
The idea is you get a certain amount of money for free to live.
Yeah.

2522
02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:38.800
And I don't know how it works.
I'm not an economist.
I'm a moron.
All right.
I am,

2523
02:16:38.850 --> 02:16:41.710
I'm not smart.
I don't understand the numbers.

2524
02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:43.660
I don't get if he's right or if he's wrong.

2525
02:16:43.661 --> 02:16:46.270
I'm not the guy and I don't have the time.
I'm not going to invest in it.

2526
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:51.400
But it's a debate.
And the debate is,
if this is common,
what do you do about it?

2527
02:16:51.401 --> 02:16:54.490
It's not whether or not it's coming,
it's pretty,
pretty likely that it's coming.

2528
02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:56.500
Oh yeah.
It's pretty likely that all of these people are going to be out of work.

2529
02:16:56.530 --> 02:16:58.300
Automation's going to take over for driving.

2530
02:16:58.301 --> 02:17:01.210
It's going to take over a lot of factory jobs right now.
There's,
you don't have,

2531
02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:04.210
you do not order from a human being.
Yeah.
You type it into a kiosk,

2532
02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:07.510
they send it over.
And to be honest with you,
it's a better experience.
Ham,

2533
02:17:07.630 --> 02:17:11.260
it's better.
It's cheaper and better.
So at what point do you go,
like,

2534
02:17:11.261 --> 02:17:13.750
I'm not like,
look,
I'm a,
that's fine.
You know,

2535
02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:16.300
I understand there's some kid who lost his taco bell job,

2536
02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:19.070
but if it's a better way and it's a better experience for the customer who's

2537
02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:23.020
spending money,
um,
yeah,
I get it,
man.
The thing is,

2538
02:17:23.021 --> 02:17:25.810
it's happening so fast.
People aren't going to be prepared for it.

2539
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:28.600
They're going to think that a certain amount of jobs going to be available and

2540
02:17:28.601 --> 02:17:31.240
then had a vast number of those are not going to be around anymore.

2541
02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:36.250
So his idea is the way you bridge the gap is you give people something that

2542
02:17:36.251 --> 02:17:38.770
meets their needs,
like your need for food and shelter.

2543
02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:41.440
Just give them enough so that they,
everything else they make,

2544
02:17:41.441 --> 02:17:45.010
they get to keep it's theirs and let them give them like a boost.

2545
02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:50.160
And the idea is that doing this would save money long term and a bunch of

2546
02:17:50.531 --> 02:17:52.870
different ways.
It's all,
it's a lot of,
it's theoretical,

2547
02:17:52.871 --> 02:17:56.620
less in taxes with this question.
If that's the case then I'm all for it.

2548
02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:00.190
That was it.
Always that though.
Like here's the thing,
we never know.

2549
02:18:00.191 --> 02:18:02.950
We don't get an audit of where our taxes go.
Right?
We don't have no idea.

2550
02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:06.770
I have no idea what the fuck goes.
Right.
Well it's distributed throughout.

2551
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:10.270
If it went and you knew that it made an impact,

2552
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:12.010
it really did make a difference.

2553
02:18:12.430 --> 02:18:15.280
And like you knew that the people that are taking your time,

2554
02:18:15.310 --> 02:18:19.210
there's no waste and they're really trying to make the world a better place.

2555
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:22.180
Oh yeah.
But they just like a little bit of your money.
You'd be like,
oh,
okay.

2556
02:18:22.181 --> 02:18:23.260
You're trying to make the world a better place.

2557
02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:26.230
Like clearly these people are making the world a better place.

2558
02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:28.890
If you knew that for sure,
and you felt that for sure.
You're like,

2559
02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.930
I like the attitude behind this is a very community oriented,

2560
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:34.810
we're going to fix the United States hair.
It takes some of them,
that'd be great,

2561
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:36.430
but it's not that,
but it's trying to go call on,

2562
02:18:36.431 --> 02:18:40.450
ain't trying to go get your license renewed a over the phone and see the amount

2563
02:18:40.451 --> 02:18:41.710
of people you have to talk to.

2564
02:18:41.711 --> 02:18:44.050
The amount of times you get hung up on the amount of times you have to call back

2565
02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.390
and you realize there's all of these wastes of jobs.

2566
02:18:46.391 --> 02:18:49.600
All these people that don't need to be there.
And it's to be honest with you,

2567
02:18:49.601 --> 02:18:51.880
everyone is sort of protecting that.

2568
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:55.930
There's like an entire industry of people that work 45 minutes per day and they

2569
02:18:55.931 --> 02:18:58.510
like it that way.
They don't want to have any type of real passion.

2570
02:18:58.511 --> 02:19:01.720
This is what they do.
Um,
so yeah,
everyone's sorta this,

2571
02:19:01.721 --> 02:19:03.220
I want you to the entertainment industry all the time.

2572
02:19:03.221 --> 02:19:06.220
Like we create these shows and we do these things and you know,

2573
02:19:06.221 --> 02:19:08.560
you guys have a very popular show.
Um,

2574
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:11.230
if this was a studio run shelf,

2575
02:19:11.231 --> 02:19:14.770
this was run by ABC Joe Rogan experience change nothing.

2576
02:19:14.810 --> 02:19:16.690
If you know what they would do,

2577
02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:21.310
there'd be literally 20 people behind cameras right now.
Clipboards.

2578
02:19:21.311 --> 02:19:23.170
There'd be people on walkie talkies,
it'd be headsets.

2579
02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:26.200
All of these jobs that don't need to be there.
Guaranteed.

2580
02:19:26.201 --> 02:19:30.230
Have you ever gone to one of the,
there's a lot of studios in la where it's like,

2581
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:33.800
just sort of corporate one podcasts videos when there's 10 people behind the

2582
02:19:33.801 --> 02:19:36.860
camera,
you're like,
what are you doing?
I did Bill Simmons,
Hbo Show.

2583
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:41.840
Really Nice Guy.
That big podcast.
I don't know it now,
you know.
Right.
Jamie?

2584
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:44.810
Yeah.
Um,
and I was,
uh,
we,

2585
02:19:44.811 --> 02:19:47.930
we basically did a podcast just with cameras and,

2586
02:19:47.931 --> 02:19:49.790
but there was like 30 people there.
Yup.

2587
02:19:49.890 --> 02:19:52.670
They'll all these people that are doing this and that and like every other

2588
02:19:52.671 --> 02:19:56.060
studio job.
Yeah.
And who's stepping up?
Nobody sat up going,
hey guys,

2589
02:19:56.061 --> 02:19:58.280
I'm not really needed here.
Just so you know,
I'm going to dip out.

2590
02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:00.920
There's union gigs too by the way.

2591
02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:03.790
Like if you want to have lighting and you want to have cameras on you,

2592
02:20:03.791 --> 02:20:06.800
you have to use these guys.
And this is how,
I mean,
even if you don't need them,

2593
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:11.510
you would have to use it.
It's,
it's interesting on one hand,

2594
02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:16.100
for the longest time I think,
um,
people,
uh,

2595
02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:19.640
didn't have as many opportunities.
You know,
you,
you really,

2596
02:20:19.641 --> 02:20:23.530
if you wanted to do something,
no matter what it would be,
whether it's,
um,

2597
02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:27.290
a television show or you want her to be a host of a talk show or whatever the

2598
02:20:27.291 --> 02:20:29.510
fuck it was,
there was not that many paths.

2599
02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:32.780
There's only allotted a couple of avenues.
There's only a few channels,

2600
02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:36.800
so only a few slots ever,
right.
For the little shows.
But now it's,
no,

2601
02:20:36.801 --> 02:20:39.530
it's not the case anymore,
man.
Yeah.
This is not the case.

2602
02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:42.410
There's a fucking million different channels.

2603
02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:44.960
And if you get roped into that old mentality,

2604
02:20:44.961 --> 02:20:48.020
like there's still a few of those old vampires,

2605
02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:52.550
it claim to that old system and they would rather you come do it on television.

2606
02:20:52.551 --> 02:20:57.070
They'll chop it up every 15 minutes and put a big factor in my crazy like uh,

2607
02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:01.360
cause I was on Sirius Xm for a while doing a show and it's just like you,

2608
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:05.830
they fire Depaulo said you're outta here.
Yeah they did.

2609
02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:07.430
He tweeted some crazy shit that he did.

2610
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:09.260
If you had a corporate job and can't tweak crazy shit,

2611
02:21:09.790 --> 02:21:13.730
nick depaulo that's what you get tired now.

2612
02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:15.780
I can't ask him to quit.

2613
02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.560
It was me and Bisping and Bisping kept on just not showing up.

2614
02:21:18.561 --> 02:21:19.820
He was like done with it basically.

2615
02:21:20.350 --> 02:21:23.320
And they tried to match me up with like some football player and I was like,

2616
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:24.260
she's fucking hit me in Pittsburgh.

2617
02:21:24.270 --> 02:21:28.190
He was gonna start a podcast and that we're doing literally 50 times as good.

2618
02:21:28.191 --> 02:21:32.990
I mean,
I mean it's not even close,
but it's,
they have all these food.

2619
02:21:32.991 --> 02:21:36.700
There's three producers in the studio.
We have.
It's just all of like the,

2620
02:21:36.701 --> 02:21:41.210
the like the spirit and the fun part and the entertaining part of it is sort of

2621
02:21:41.211 --> 02:21:41.931
sucked out of it.

2622
02:21:41.931 --> 02:21:44.780
You're very specific segments and it's regimented in your producers have to know

2623
02:21:44.781 --> 02:21:48.070
exactly where you're going with the next thing and you like,
don't get,

2624
02:21:48.071 --> 02:21:51.560
we're not going to get anywhere cool or interesting.
If we're this regimented,

2625
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:54.320
if we're,
if you're not letting and allowing us to sort of play,

2626
02:21:54.321 --> 02:21:57.350
you're not going to really,
and this is why I think,
you know,
radio is,

2627
02:21:57.351 --> 02:22:01.230
is getting destroyed by podcasts right now.
Um,

2628
02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:04.740
every UCC,
her sex,
I'm now,
they're going,
shit,
we got to start a podcast network.

2629
02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:08.300
They're starting their own podcast now.
You know,
they did.
They bought Pandora.

2630
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:12.770
Did they?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think so.
Is that true?
I believe it's a partnership.
Yeah.

2631
02:22:12.771 --> 02:22:16.900
I think I heard something like that as well.
Interesting.
Yeah.

2632
02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:21.200
And uh hmm.
You have fives with Hulu.
It now I just got an email about that.

2633
02:22:21.470 --> 02:22:26.160
You get a free Hulu subscription with your Spotify.
It's all crazy.

2634
02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:28.860
They don't know what to do now and now they're like podcasting.
That's a thing.

2635
02:22:28.861 --> 02:22:33.510
So there's throwing so much money at all of these companies buying companies for

2636
02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:35.790
like hundreds of millions of dollars,
$230 million.

2637
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:38.310
They just bought one another company,
130 million.

2638
02:22:38.370 --> 02:22:41.640
It feels like one of those early date tech boom things.

2639
02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:44.730
Everybody's just like going crazy and spent all this money.
He's like,
Whoa,
Whoa,

2640
02:22:44.731 --> 02:22:49.050
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
okay.
What are you doing?

2641
02:22:49.810 --> 02:22:54.690
Why you spending that much money?
How could you possibly,
by the way,

2642
02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:58.380
the company they bought is just an idea.
I mean,
what is it really?

2643
02:22:58.381 --> 02:23:01.500
It's like we have this idea for this app and me,
you know,
me and my partner,

2644
02:23:01.501 --> 02:23:01.811
we have a,

2645
02:23:01.811 --> 02:23:06.540
we have our own podcast network called guests digital and we've been practicing

2646
02:23:06.541 --> 02:23:07.860
what they're doing.
Like we,
you know,

2647
02:23:07.861 --> 02:23:11.430
we have premium content that we have on the website.

2648
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:14.340
People have to pay for some of your shit.
All of the podcasts are free.

2649
02:23:14.341 --> 02:23:16.260
The latest 15 are free on youtube and iTunes.

2650
02:23:16.261 --> 02:23:20.280
And then the on demand library is a premium with a ad Fraser premium.

2651
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:24.450
So we in insert the ads after the fact,
um,
uncensored,

2652
02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:26.610
they get like a three or four day prerelease on the episodes.

2653
02:23:26.611 --> 02:23:29.850
So there's all these benefits for becoming a premium member.
And you know,

2654
02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:32.940
a certain percentage of people subscribe to the network for the premium stuff.

2655
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:34.770
Um,
which is great.

2656
02:23:34.771 --> 02:23:38.760
But we've been putting this into practice for years now and now we're watching

2657
02:23:38.761 --> 02:23:42.050
these companies get whatever,
$239.
We're like,
Huh?
You really,

2658
02:23:42.090 --> 02:23:45.420
you guys are disgusting.
Like,
yeah,
you guys know we can't.
It's over.

2659
02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:48.720
No one's going to pay for,
nope,
they're going to be connected with you.

2660
02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:52.040
You guys get too crazy.
You're right.
You're 100% right.
You don't.

2661
02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:54.960
But that's the beautiful thing.
It's like you don't really need that.
No,

2662
02:23:54.961 --> 02:23:58.530
I don't want it.
So already put $230 million into my company right now.

2663
02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:02.460
We would have bosses,
we would be told,
we can't say.
They'd be like,
are you crazy?

2664
02:24:02.461 --> 02:24:03.294
Did you guys just,

2665
02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:07.080
did you guys just have a bill Cosby rape victim beauty pageant on Legion of

2666
02:24:07.081 --> 02:24:10.380
skanks?
Did that actually just happen?
Which it did.
That was a great episode guys.

2667
02:24:10.381 --> 02:24:15.360
Go check it out.
Um,
we,
I mean it gets fucking,
we is ridiculous.
Yeah.

2668
02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.840
But the point is that these companies,
um,
it's,

2669
02:24:18.841 --> 02:24:22.500
they're showing that they're understanding that there's something going on with

2670
02:24:22.501 --> 02:24:26.040
the podcasting world.
They just throw out a lot of money.
Of course.
I mean,
look,

2671
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:28.800
if they're buying really good companies,
they're making really good podcasts.

2672
02:24:28.801 --> 02:24:32.610
I'm happy.
I love podcasts.
Listening to them.
I hope they do well,

2673
02:24:32.970 --> 02:24:35.850
but it's just shocking.
And obviously I'm not a business person so I don't,

2674
02:24:35.851 --> 02:24:39.850
maybe there's some here have a very much a business personal charm to it though.

2675
02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:42.960
Maybe there's some sort of a grand plan.

2676
02:24:43.470 --> 02:24:47.760
Maybe there's like some sort of a podcast battle going on between like apple and

2677
02:24:47.761 --> 02:24:49.710
Spotify and streaming services.

2678
02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:53.160
People are doing premium shit to where they're buying out podcasts and they're

2679
02:24:53.161 --> 02:24:57.840
only putting it on where you have to be a subscriber for Spotify or whatever

2680
02:24:57.841 --> 02:25:01.050
else it is.
Which just strange because type shit,
yeah.

2681
02:25:01.051 --> 02:25:04.530
This podcast grow by sharing.
You have to be able to share them.
You know,

2682
02:25:04.531 --> 02:25:06.530
you people have to be able to download it for free.

2683
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:09.150
They fall in love with the content and then that's that they'll come buy a

2684
02:25:09.151 --> 02:25:13.440
ticket,
they'll buy a tee shirt,
whatever it is.
Um,
so I think it's a little bit,

2685
02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:15.510
I think is a little counterintuitive.

2686
02:25:15.511 --> 02:25:19.770
I don't think it's a good idea to hide podcast behind a pay wall.

2687
02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:22.260
I wonder what they're going to try to do.
See,

2688
02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:24.700
Spotify doesn't have to hide anything behind a pay wall,

2689
02:25:24.701 --> 02:25:28.090
but there are some companies that are trying to do something behind a paywall

2690
02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:32.260
and they're paying for a bunch of different podcasts and they're going to launch

2691
02:25:32.261 --> 02:25:35.560
it like,
like a,
like a network.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

2692
02:25:36.850 --> 02:25:40.830
I mean Kumi does that a little bit with a compound media network.

2693
02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:43.210
For Awhile we were the first show,
um,

2694
02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:45.340
book to his network and I think it's a mistake.

2695
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:47.170
And I love Anthony and I told him this,

2696
02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:50.380
I offer to go work with Anthony when you first heard the network.
Um,

2697
02:25:50.470 --> 02:25:54.160
I think that he should do what we do have Anthony put out his shows free.

2698
02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:56.950
He would be constantly discovered by new people.

2699
02:25:56.951 --> 02:26:00.610
And then it's figuring out how to get a higher percentage of people to subscribe

2700
02:26:00.611 --> 02:26:04.570
to your premium content and you will consent can continue to grow that number.

2701
02:26:04.571 --> 02:26:06.970
And it's just,
it's literally every time we do a podcast,

2702
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:09.880
there's x amount of new listeners that are discovering it for the first time.

2703
02:26:09.881 --> 02:26:12.700
So you have sort of another opportunity if people aren't discovering your

2704
02:26:12.701 --> 02:26:14.100
podcast,
it's an issue.
Um,

2705
02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:18.610
but I think they did start doing some free episodes on compound you the free

2706
02:26:18.611 --> 02:26:22.900
ones up occasionally.
Look,
he's a really brilliant guy.
He's a fun dude to,

2707
02:26:22.901 --> 02:26:27.220
and he's one of the funniest,
crazy one of the funniest people,
period.

2708
02:26:27.221 --> 02:26:30.620
I love broadcasting with Anthony.
It's the legend,
the legend.
I mean,
you know,
we,

2709
02:26:30.621 --> 02:26:32.470
you know,
I didn't even grow up on Opie and Anthony.

2710
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:36.310
I never listened opie and Anthony once in my entire life until after I knew

2711
02:26:36.311 --> 02:26:40.080
Anthony and I started listening back to old shit with like Patrice and nortons

2712
02:26:40.090 --> 02:26:42.670
great.
I'm friends with Norton to when they were all on together.

2713
02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:44.560
Those are some of the best episodes ever.

2714
02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:49.760
You know Patrice Norton and Anthony,
he's just going crazy about things.
Yeah.

2715
02:26:50.170 --> 02:26:52.690
Fuck,
great show man.
Yeah,

2716
02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:56.320
they that Opie and Anthony taught me how to do a podcast and a lot of ways I've

2717
02:26:56.321 --> 02:26:59.050
heard you say that it was like a hang and I was like,
oh,

2718
02:26:59.051 --> 02:27:01.750
it doesn't have to be that structured where someone's got like a list of

2719
02:27:01.751 --> 02:27:05.980
questions and they're rattling off.
Like that's not fun.
Like a hang is fun,

2720
02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:09.670
you know?
And even when it goes bad,
it's funny.
That's the best.

2721
02:27:09.671 --> 02:27:12.070
That's what opie and Anthony figured out,
which was great.

2722
02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:13.300
It's like when it's bad,

2723
02:27:13.301 --> 02:27:17.170
it's even better because when somebody bombs or there's a joke doesn't go well,

2724
02:27:17.171 --> 02:27:21.820
then the entire room just smashes them.
People don't know.

2725
02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:24.340
I don't know if you've ever told a joke that didn't go well in a room of people.

2726
02:27:24.341 --> 02:27:26.980
It's awful.
And then have the best comics in the world start trashing.

2727
02:27:26.981 --> 02:27:30.130
You live on air while millions of people are listening around the country.

2728
02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.930
Oh my God,
dude,
it's so good.

2729
02:27:32.050 --> 02:27:36.910
It also enforced the comradery between comedians and like that kind of a form.

2730
02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:38.100
We'd all get together and seat.

2731
02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:41.170
You'd meet a bunch of different comics at the show too.

2732
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.250
You meet guys from others.

2733
02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:45.180
Like you might be sitting in with some comic from Philly,
you know,

2734
02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:48.910
you get to know people.
That was,
yeah.
That they did that for sure.
That like,
uh,

2735
02:27:48.911 --> 02:27:49.744
that,
that,

2736
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:54.190
that definitely like it enforced it a little bit,

2737
02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.460
you know?
Yeah.
I mean,
once again,
you know,

2738
02:27:57.461 --> 02:28:01.240
you're sort of having three or four people that are really smart,

2739
02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:03.400
that are good at radio,
good at broadcasting as well,

2740
02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:07.690
be able to react in real time.
You're going to get these things.

2741
02:28:07.691 --> 02:28:12.040
You just couldn't get it anywhere else.
You know?
It's,
it's such a,
yeah.

2742
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:16.570
And those guys were some of the best at it.
Um,
you know,
the whole,
uh,

2743
02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:20.250
the whole way it went down,
you know,
at the end of it kind of sucked.
Well,

2744
02:28:20.350 --> 02:28:24.290
really it's the,
this is,
it's not just the birth of podcasting because of that.

2745
02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.990
It's for a couple reasons.
Opie and Anthony and in my opinion,

2746
02:28:26.991 --> 02:28:28.850
or like the birth of podcasting,

2747
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.380
one of them was Anthony built his own studio in his basement where he would do

2748
02:28:33.381 --> 02:28:37.480
karaoke holding a machine gun.
He's fucking crazy.
So he compounds,

2749
02:28:37.481 --> 02:28:40.910
you know his logo was,
it looked like a swastika from afar.
No,

2750
02:28:40.911 --> 02:28:45.140
I swear to God he's again,
he stopped leaning in to the white supremacy stuff.

2751
02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:47.910
I'm trying to be friends with you.
Does he think he's doing it for a he?

2752
02:28:47.911 --> 02:28:49.850
He's an Haha funny.
He thinks it's funny,

2753
02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:52.980
but he's also a 60 year old Italian guy from long island.
It looked like

2754
02:28:55.420 --> 02:28:58.800
what is happening,
hardest vibrators I felt in a long,
this thing is ridiculous.

2755
02:28:58.850 --> 02:29:01.850
If you talk to most 60 year old Italian man in Long Island,

2756
02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:06.740
they're going to have some fairly controversial views on race and politics in

2757
02:29:06.741 --> 02:29:09.500
the country.
And you know,
I think he,
when he left Sirius Xm,

2758
02:29:09.501 --> 02:29:13.130
he leaned a little bit too much into the political side and he sort of got,

2759
02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:14.960
you know,
now he's pegged as like a right wing guy,

2760
02:29:14.961 --> 02:29:19.550
but I'm a fucking Puerto Rican kid.
Who was raised definitely right wing,

2761
02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:23.570
but he is right wing.
But I'm just saying,
I don't think that,
I don't,

2762
02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:25.670
that's not what I look at when I broadcast with Anthony.

2763
02:29:25.671 --> 02:29:27.020
I don't talk about politics.

2764
02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:29.510
We just talk about whatever we talk about fucking stupid shit.

2765
02:29:29.511 --> 02:29:31.910
Barbecue potato chips.
Well,
he'll talk to you about anything,

2766
02:29:31.911 --> 02:29:36.500
but we'll talk about politics too.
He's not a dumb guy.
Smart Guy.
He's just crazy.

2767
02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:41.700
He's fun.
You know what I mean?
It's not perfect.
No one is.
Yeah.
I just also,

2768
02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:45.580
I don't look at people that,
um,
number one,
I don't give a fuck about it,

2769
02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:47.210
about what anybody's political views are.

2770
02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:50.240
I would never hang out with somebody or not hanging out with them based off of

2771
02:29:50.241 --> 02:29:53.180
what their political views are.
If that is their entire identity,

2772
02:29:53.181 --> 02:29:56.390
then it becomes an issue because then you're probably an issue to them.
Right.

2773
02:29:56.780 --> 02:30:00.740
So many people are to so many people unnecessarily,
so much.

2774
02:30:00.770 --> 02:30:05.720
There's so much unnecessary conflict,
you know?
I mean,
some of it's good,

2775
02:30:05.721 --> 02:30:10.670
but some of it's just not,
you can be friends with people that you don't agree.

2776
02:30:10.671 --> 02:30:14.300
I mean,
Nick Depaulo disagree with like 75% of shit.

2777
02:30:15.290 --> 02:30:17.610
I love the guy.
I always love hanging out with him.

2778
02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.400
I've known him forever and never,
never like never do I say God's nick again.

2779
02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:24.590
I love it when he gets mad about shit.
Damn.
Well what?

2780
02:30:24.591 --> 02:30:29.430
You don't know what fucking Obama debt.
Yeah,
it's great.
He loves it.
He's on,

2781
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:34.760
he's on that a cameo website and you can just pay him to trash your liberal

2782
02:30:34.761 --> 02:30:38.060
friends.
Oh,
that's fun.
It's so fucking funny.
And he'll just like,
it was like,

2783
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:42.740
what do you like fucking Hillary?
You fucking faggot
in his kitchen.

2784
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:47.000
It's fucking great wife beater on.
Yeah,
but look,
Patrice,
you know,

2785
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:50.780
I remember I watched my son,
my son's mother was in labor for 30 hours,

2786
02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:53.240
fucking crazy long labor overnight.

2787
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:55.430
And then the next morning she's like lying down.

2788
02:30:55.431 --> 02:30:57.590
He's like in the little fucking other room or whatever.

2789
02:30:57.591 --> 02:31:01.430
And I'm watching like a fan made Patrice O'Neal documentary and he's just saying

2790
02:31:01.431 --> 02:31:06.431
like the most heinous shit about how women aren't shit and about how fucking a

2791
02:31:06.801 --> 02:31:08.380
bitch,
you know,
she needs you and blah.

2792
02:31:08.390 --> 02:31:12.770
And I just watched my son's mother pushed my son out of her for 30 hours.

2793
02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:16.010
It was fucking,
I mean the,
the whole experience was so mind blowing.

2794
02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:19.070
And in my mind I'm going,
I could never in a million years do what she just did.

2795
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:23.010
I had this whole other appreciation for what a woman is.
It's like a,

2796
02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:26.580
it blows your mind when you got kids and then Patrice has fuck it up.

2797
02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:31.350
They're just,
it's a big fat black guy saying horse shit cause he's,
he's fucking,

2798
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:35.580
but it's the funniest shit on the planet,
the absolute Phoenician on the planet.

2799
02:31:35.581 --> 02:31:37.320
And you can laugh at it.
You don't have to get mad at it.

2800
02:31:37.321 --> 02:31:39.810
I don't agree with half the Shitty,
most of the shit that he says,

2801
02:31:39.870 --> 02:31:44.430
all that fucking Aye.
Look Dude,
I'm an idiot.
I don't look at,
I don't,

2802
02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:46.590
I don't go after women that are below me.

2803
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:49.620
I like to go after women that are above me and that sort of elevate me and make

2804
02:31:49.621 --> 02:31:52.320
me want to be better.
I think that's,
it's a little check and balance.

2805
02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:55.260
This am I have him for myself,
you know.
Um,

2806
02:31:55.470 --> 02:31:59.130
but you don't have to be so connected to whatever the message is.

2807
02:31:59.131 --> 02:32:02.700
You can literally take it for face value,
which is,
it's just really funny.

2808
02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:07.170
Like undeniably funny.
Yeah.
He was a monster and he also,
he had points,

2809
02:32:07.410 --> 02:32:11.100
really good psychological insight.
He knew what made people tick.

2810
02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:14.910
He knew it made people say stupid shit.
If he knew what made people stumble.

2811
02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:15.661
He's a,

2812
02:32:15.661 --> 02:32:20.661
he was a master at understanding like how to get off controversial ideas.

2813
02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:23.340
Yeah.
You know,
he was,
but his,

2814
02:32:23.610 --> 02:32:27.180
his contribution for a lot of us was a,

2815
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:32.010
he had an extra level of,
I don't give a fuck,
you know,
like you'd see Don roasts.

2816
02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:34.720
He would,
he'd,
you know,
he'd roast and he was like,

2817
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:40.140
I don't even know why I'm up here.
Even on my level was a Charlie sheen.

2818
02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:41.920
Yes.
Charlie Sheen.
Rosie Gay.

2819
02:32:41.921 --> 02:32:46.090
And he just went off script through the paper and he's just brilliant.
Martyred.

2820
02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:48.750
He's a killer.
And he only did that one cause he,

2821
02:32:48.751 --> 02:32:51.390
I guess he agreed because he said that was the only guy that he was interested

2822
02:32:51.391 --> 02:32:55.280
in.
Rosie was like,
I'm not doing it for the paycheck trolley.
Shane's a fucking G.

2823
02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:59.850
Yeah.
Um,
well it's just that he's,
you know,
he would,

2824
02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:04.560
he just had this don't give a fuck style.
Yeah.
And we all,
like,

2825
02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:07.950
we all,
I think I,
let me speaking for myself,
I appreciate,

2826
02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:11.280
I don't give a fuck style more than any other style of comedy.
For me,

2827
02:33:11.281 --> 02:33:15.000
my favorite shit was like,
first of all,
Joey Diaz,

2828
02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:18.690
but then when you go back to the greats,
like Kinison and Hicks,

2829
02:33:18.691 --> 02:33:22.740
and this guys didn't give a fuck.
They went out,
they went off,

2830
02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:26.700
and it was the most fun to watch as a person who is a,
an audience member.
For me,

2831
02:33:26.701 --> 02:33:29.760
it was the most fun to watch.
And I think,
you know,
that's,

2832
02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:31.280
that's the shit that are,
and it's,
yeah,

2833
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:35.250
we grew up on that and then society changes.
And I'm like,
no,
dude,
I've been,

2834
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:39.000
I've been working on this for so long.
Please let me,

2835
02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:43.500
I have to change my entire,
like foundation of what I think is funny now because,

2836
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:46.270
and it's almost like,
and that's why I think guys like Legion of skanks and,

2837
02:33:46.271 --> 02:33:49.470
and the special,
you guys name it,
Legion of skanks me and big J.
Okay.

2838
02:33:49.770 --> 02:33:53.910
So BJ would constantly cheat on his wife and uh,

2839
02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:56.550
it was like a regular car and she knew it and everyone knew it.

2840
02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:59.010
And one time we were there and then we were hanging out and we were about to

2841
02:33:59.011 --> 02:34:00.720
leave her in an argument and she's like,
fuck you,

2842
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:04.950
why don't you go hang out with your legion of skanks and me and big Jay,

2843
02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:06.570
we were both playing guitar hero at the time.

2844
02:34:06.571 --> 02:34:08.700
There was like a big game at the time.
We both looked at each other.

2845
02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:09.930
We're like guitar hero name.

2846
02:34:10.170 --> 02:34:12.570
And that was what we named our band initially and guitar hero,

2847
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:17.220
I was Legion of skanks and then we're not that creative.
So we wrote a script.

2848
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:21.880
How long ago was this?
Probably 10 years ago.
10 years ago,
10 years ago.
The name.

2849
02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:25.590
And then that was the guitar hero band.
Maybe even more.
Probably more.
Yeah.

2850
02:34:25.591 --> 02:34:29.230
Actually way more.
Cause it was right when me and big Jay became friends.
Um,

2851
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:32.500
and then we wrote a legion of skanks is a great name.

2852
02:34:32.501 --> 02:34:35.920
It's probably one of the all time greatest names of anything.
Right.

2853
02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:39.860
You stop and think about like bands or television,
legion of skanks.

2854
02:34:39.890 --> 02:34:42.700
That is a great thank you.
Thank you Joe.
Great Name.

2855
02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:45.850
Well I gotta give it to big Jack because he recognized it immediately and then

2856
02:34:45.851 --> 02:34:48.820
every project we ever did since then has been named Legion of skanks until the

2857
02:34:48.821 --> 02:34:53.350
podcast work.
It's good move.
Yeah.
And it uh,
yeah,
it's,
you know,

2858
02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:55.690
people know what they're getting.
They get it,
dude.

2859
02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:58.960
They get an end to be honest with you.
People.
People want that type of humor.

2860
02:34:58.961 --> 02:35:03.640
That's the other thing is like,
it's the new alternative is like dirty,
edgier,

2861
02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:06.220
ballsy shit.
Well it's what we were talking about earlier.
Look,

2862
02:35:06.221 --> 02:35:08.950
if you like punk rock,
you should be able to listen to punk rock.

2863
02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:13.300
But if you like the kind of comedy that some people like aggressive,

2864
02:35:13.390 --> 02:35:17.290
like outlandish comedy you like,
if that's what you like,

2865
02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.520
then you should be able to enjoy it or not.
It's up to you.

2866
02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:24.550
It's like you don't have to like it.
You don't have to listen.

2867
02:35:24.551 --> 02:35:25.420
You don't have to watch.

2868
02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:28.750
It's not that it makes you immune from criticism if people don't like it.

2869
02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:33.940
But you know,
it's,
everybody's got different tastes.

2870
02:35:34.410 --> 02:35:35.680
And,
and to be honest with you,

2871
02:35:35.681 --> 02:35:38.890
if I want it to sit here and deconstruct everything that could trigger me in

2872
02:35:38.891 --> 02:35:41.110
life,
I'm just not a bitch.
I don't,

2873
02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:46.140
I don't sit here and I'm triggered every moment by the amount of shit that I've

2874
02:35:46.151 --> 02:35:49.570
seen in my fucking life.
Everything triggers me,
everything triggers me.

2875
02:35:49.571 --> 02:35:53.040
And every movie that I watched is if there's some fucked up seeing,
I can go,
oh,

2876
02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:55.140
that reminds me of some fucked up shit.
Um,

2877
02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:58.060
but you have to appreciate those things.

2878
02:35:58.061 --> 02:36:02.660
Don't you sort of want sort of everything to be represented and,
and,

2879
02:36:02.661 --> 02:36:05.200
and even with comedy,
when you look at things like right,
rape jokes,

2880
02:36:05.201 --> 02:36:07.960
it's like a big no,
no topic.
Right.
You can't do rape jokes anymore.

2881
02:36:08.470 --> 02:36:11.140
And I understand he was a mimickers bit.
Right.
Which one?

2882
02:36:11.290 --> 02:36:16.180
Well I can't say it shit cause you put it on a special he,
I'm sure he is.

2883
02:36:16.450 --> 02:36:20.320
Well I'll tell you about it afterwards that just get the first time I met him in

2884
02:36:20.321 --> 02:36:23.440
Montreal like years ago.
You don't remember it or any moons at that little place.

2885
02:36:23.441 --> 02:36:27.450
The comedy works.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jim vose joint.
Yup.
Um,

2886
02:36:27.730 --> 02:36:31.300
great little spot man.
But yeah.
Yes.
Rape Jokes.
We'll work up.
I close by,

2887
02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:33.760
especially with the 10 minute rape joke.
How dare you,

2888
02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:38.080
how dare you try to pass that off to America.
But um,
the um,

2889
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:41.650
I can't do the bit but the bits excellent.
Remind me and I'll tell you off,

2890
02:36:41.651 --> 02:36:45.160
cause it's one of those premise that like once you say the premise,
it ruins it.

2891
02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.620
Yeah.
So you have to,
it has to be a very high level.

2892
02:36:47.621 --> 02:36:52.240
But the woman in the crowd who was raped a month ago and it's like,

2893
02:36:52.330 --> 02:36:54.340
I'm going to go out,
I'm going to go to a comedy club to feel better.

2894
02:36:54.820 --> 02:36:56.380
She's not wrong if she's triggered,

2895
02:36:56.590 --> 02:37:01.590
but she becomes wrong when she's tries to take away the experience from other

2896
02:37:02.381 --> 02:37:05.290
people.
You have to walk away and you have every right.
And I feel bad.

2897
02:37:05.291 --> 02:37:08.530
I've had girls come up to me after shows and be like,
hey,
just so you know,

2898
02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:11.890
that really bothers me.
This is why.
Right.
And I,

2899
02:37:11.891 --> 02:37:14.920
it's a rape joke or whatever it is.
Right.
How many rape jokes?

2900
02:37:14.921 --> 02:37:19.830
She got at least 70% of my act.
Um,
I do.
I really know.

2901
02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:23.360
I'd say no.
I do close my act with a 10 minute rape joke.
Yeah,
he just said that.

2902
02:37:23.361 --> 02:37:26.390
But I mean,
how many rape jokes,
like overall do you have,

2903
02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:30.710
how many times I say the rape or is it no bits.

2904
02:37:33.210 --> 02:37:37.410
I mean really just that one raped.
It's with long bit though.

2905
02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:41.070
So it's a lot of jokes within it and I'm being raped in the joke most of the

2906
02:37:41.071 --> 02:37:45.710
time.
Okay.
So that's,
you know,
I think that's why a guy being raped,

2907
02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:49.310
it helps.
But I,
you know,
I don't want,
I don't want to ruin the bid either,

2908
02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:52.490
but I think you have to.
Um,
I,

2909
02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:54.480
I respect the fact that people can be triggered,

2910
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:57.510
but it's a very strange thing to me because for me,

2911
02:37:57.630 --> 02:38:01.800
I'm always trying to find something really funny from this dark shit,
right?

2912
02:38:01.801 --> 02:38:03.420
Whether it's a personal experience or whatever it is.

2913
02:38:03.690 --> 02:38:07.020
And the way we're looking at as comics is we're trying to find something really

2914
02:38:07.021 --> 02:38:09.840
positive out of something really shitty.
And then you have like a movie,

2915
02:38:10.050 --> 02:38:13.720
which is just,
maybe it's a fucked up seem.
There's nothing.
I mean,
look,
it's a,

2916
02:38:13.721 --> 02:38:17.370
it's a positive piece of content.
Tag it to one person talking,
you know,

2917
02:38:17.371 --> 02:38:19.800
it's a scene.
You're watching people act out a scene.
You're right.

2918
02:38:20.130 --> 02:38:24.570
There's something very personal about one person talking.
That's why this is not,

2919
02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:27.120
this is how some people would look at it.

2920
02:38:27.210 --> 02:38:32.210
Like you should talk about things that you really care about while you're doing

2921
02:38:32.791 --> 02:38:35.100
that because you only have a certain amount of time to do it.

2922
02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:37.593
<v 7>You know?</v>

2923
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:39.910
<v 3>And some sometimes,</v>

2924
02:38:40.990 --> 02:38:41.520
<v 7>okay.</v>

2925
02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:46.200
<v 3>Yeah.
Sometimes.
Sometimes you,
you have a bit that's just not worth it.
You know,</v>

2926
02:38:46.201 --> 02:38:49.500
like the way people react to it.
Just like,
yeah.
Even though you have a point,

2927
02:38:49.530 --> 02:38:51.960
it's like even working this bid out,
people are getting so upset.

2928
02:38:52.350 --> 02:38:55.020
It's almost not worth it.
No,
it has to be a net positive.

2929
02:38:55.021 --> 02:38:58.830
The crowd has to be laughing,
so there's no,
you know,
I'm okay,

2930
02:38:59.550 --> 02:39:02.640
I will defend somebody.
Right.
To tell a shitty joke.
You know what I'm saying?

2931
02:39:02.670 --> 02:39:03.540
But at the same time,

2932
02:39:03.541 --> 02:39:07.710
I understand if as a performer you have to gauge the audience and put your

2933
02:39:07.711 --> 02:39:10.080
finger in the air and go,
okay,
which way is the wind blown right now?

2934
02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:13.680
The reality is you can't say things that used to say,

2935
02:39:13.681 --> 02:39:16.980
you can't say faggot on stage anymore in a crowd in New York or la.

2936
02:39:17.130 --> 02:39:19.250
You can't say that word.
The crowd will tighten up and shut down.

2937
02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:22.920
You'll ruin the rest of whatever that joke is.
So it's obviously,

2938
02:39:22.921 --> 02:39:27.630
I haven't seen dia as recently.
Maybe they say packing a lunch,
he'll say,

2939
02:39:28.410 --> 02:39:31.980
oh,
he's awesome.
He'll say whatever he wants.
But I got a point,
you know,

2940
02:39:32.310 --> 02:39:34.200
I have a joke about,
you know,
my,
uh,

2941
02:39:34.470 --> 02:39:38.100
my dog and I used to say my faggot dog because he's looking at another male dogs

2942
02:39:38.101 --> 02:39:42.720
asshole on the joke and uh,
and people would shut down at that word.

2943
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:44.670
And it's really,
to be honest with in New York and La,

2944
02:39:44.671 --> 02:39:49.260
that's where the biggest faggots live.
The rest of the country is cool.

2945
02:39:49.261 --> 02:39:51.960
If you go anywhere else,
they don't really give a shit about words like that.

2946
02:39:52.170 --> 02:39:56.190
But in New York and La,
it's become a particularly hard thing to,
you know,

2947
02:39:56.191 --> 02:39:58.140
there's certain words and certain things and it's not even the content

2948
02:39:58.141 --> 02:40:01.420
necessarily.
It's just those words that sort of set people's sensors off.
Well,

2949
02:40:01.470 --> 02:40:03.960
there's always going to be a bunch of words like that.

2950
02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:08.010
What's really interesting is what does happen when you stop people from saying

2951
02:40:08.011 --> 02:40:08.520
it?

2952
02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:13.510
Cause it's Kinda counterintuitive because those words become these forbidden to

2953
02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:14.040
give them more

2954
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.030
<v 0>power.
It's,
they have so much more power if you don't,
and I don't just,</v>

2955
02:40:18.031 --> 02:40:23.031
I just don't think you ever get to tell people that you can't say certain words

2956
02:40:23.041 --> 02:40:25.500
that you used to be able to say all the time.
You know,

2957
02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:28.980
I mean the idea behind those words,
it's still the same.

2958
02:40:29.010 --> 02:40:32.580
Like if you say to someone you shouldn't say retarded anymore,

2959
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.900
even though that used to be like a term that they would use for things being

2960
02:40:36.901 --> 02:40:41.160
slower,
like their growth being slower,
their growth was retarded.

2961
02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.990
But now if you even use it as a technical term,
like in,

2962
02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.120
in the growth was retarded.
People get upset at you don't use that anymore.

2963
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:52.110
Now that's a forbidding sound.
Even if it doesn't mean what they think it means.

2964
02:40:52.111 --> 02:40:53.460
We're talking about a person with down syndrome.

2965
02:40:53.461 --> 02:40:56.210
They don't like hearing the r word.
The car you,

2966
02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:58.620
you talked about in your Special Ed,
that was a great bit where you're like,

2967
02:40:58.621 --> 02:41:02.010
just the sounds from your face.
Like what are we,
what are we doing?
You know,

2968
02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:06.440
making these different sounds with your mouth.
So you're,
yeah,
it's just sounds,

2969
02:41:06.470 --> 02:41:07.141
well,
it's a,

2970
02:41:07.141 --> 02:41:12.141
it's a biproduct of speech being a shitty way to really clearly convey intent.

2971
02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:17.160
And that's why when someone is good at speaking their mind,
we kind of get,
uh,

2972
02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:21.120
we get a real sense of we enjoy it.
Someone's good at speaking their mind,

2973
02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:24.210
but if someone's sucks,
it's speaking their mind.
You know,
if they're,

2974
02:41:24.211 --> 02:41:28.650
if they're they're clunky at it,
then it's not enjoyable.
Yeah,
I agree.

2975
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:29.543
Um,

2976
02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:35.120
and there's too many people that there's no barrier of entry and we're exposed

2977
02:41:35.491 --> 02:41:39.360
to a lot of horseshit very quickly now.
Whereas like,
I think back in the day,

2978
02:41:39.361 --> 02:41:42.750
comedians had time to grow in a club.
You know,
you look at Bob Saget,
right?

2979
02:41:42.751 --> 02:41:47.751
Bob Saget was like a dirty fucking filthy comic who ended up getting on the

2980
02:41:48.361 --> 02:41:52.500
cleanest television show ever.
Right.
The Dad,
you know,
Danny Tanner was,

2981
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:55.980
you know,
but then you,
if there was cell phones out back then,

2982
02:41:55.981 --> 02:41:57.630
he would have never gotten that Gig.
Well,

2983
02:41:57.631 --> 02:42:00.630
I think he stopped doing standup for a long time because that too,
right.

2984
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:04.350
You Guy Faculty did stand up while he was doing that show.
I might be wrong,

2985
02:42:04.351 --> 02:42:08.790
but if he did do it,
maybe did like,
uh,
an abridged,
uh,
you know,

2986
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:13.680
uh,
PG 13 version or something.
You know,

2987
02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:17.550
if I don't,
man,
it's,
is it worth it?

2988
02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:22.040
You know?
Is it worth it?
Censoring?
Tell.
I mean,

2989
02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:26.580
I think one day it seems like the more time goes on,

2990
02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.790
the more words they're sneaking it in network television,

2991
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:32.580
you hear like shit every now and then I think,

2992
02:42:32.581 --> 02:42:36.560
I think you're allowed to say shit and asshole on a network show now.
Yeah.

2993
02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:39.900
There was like a big episode once on something and say Shit in my asshole
though.

2994
02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:42.660
Now you can't say that.
Yeah.
It's just to call somebody a deck,

2995
02:42:42.661 --> 02:42:47.010
but you can refer to your deck.
That's the idea,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2996
02:42:47.011 --> 02:42:49.860
You can call someone a pussy,
I think even too,
which is weird.

2997
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:53.760
You know that one's on the way out.
Yeah,
that's cave.

2998
02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:57.900
Well now that's become a thing where you're feminizing a man and now that's

2999
02:42:57.901 --> 02:43:00.270
offensive to women.
Fucking bitch.
Now that's a fact.

3000
02:43:00.271 --> 02:43:03.390
I'm calling my buddy a pussy and you get to take the offense on that.

3001
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:06.300
That's some crazy woman shit that's actually right there.

3002
02:43:06.301 --> 02:43:08.940
That's how crazy women are.
It's not how crazy women are.

3003
02:43:08.941 --> 02:43:12.310
It's how crazy some women are.
It's like,
like some

3004
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:15.940
<v 1>men are fucking crazy too.
You just dealing with a giant number of people.</v>

3005
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.680
But if people find a little thing where they can pick on it and go after it like

3006
02:43:20.681 --> 02:43:23.240
that.
Yeah,

3007
02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:26.330
<v 2>I dunno.
I have no,
there's nothing.
There's no,
it's very funny to me.</v>

3008
02:43:26.331 --> 02:43:31.070
There's no words feminizing that could possibly offend me.

3009
02:43:31.071 --> 02:43:32.150
That could ever,
right.

3010
02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:37.200
<v 1>You know?
Well,
some people just looking for it,
man.
Right.</v>

3011
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:39.620
<v 2>I don't actually believe they're offended though.
No,
I don't think so.</v>

3012
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:41.190
I think that it's like you don't want to,
you see like a,

3013
02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:44.510
like a Puerto Rican kid get himself worked up in a fight or was like,
what?

3014
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:45.500
What'd he say?
What'd he say?

3015
02:43:45.501 --> 02:43:48.590
And he starts to like have to psychologically fucking get himself into this

3016
02:43:48.591 --> 02:43:51.020
brawl.
That's what I think people do online all day.

3017
02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:54.290
They stoke themselves up and yeah,
they don't really care.
Nobody.
Actually,

3018
02:43:54.291 --> 02:43:56.690
if they've really gave a fuck,
they would go out and do something.

3019
02:43:56.980 --> 02:44:01.750
<v 1>I think a lot of them do care what they're just expressing it on Twitter or on</v>

3020
02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:04.450
Facebook or wherever the gentleman,
I think a lot of them do care,

3021
02:44:04.930 --> 02:44:05.800
but I think that

3022
02:44:06.350 --> 02:44:10.820
<v 2>it's fake caring.
It's too easy to pretend to care now that's the problem.
Back</v>

3023
02:44:12.250 --> 02:44:14.710
<v 1>conflict.
They enjoy it.</v>

3024
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:17.350
<v 2>You think so?
I don't,
I feel shitty.</v>

3025
02:44:17.351 --> 02:44:19.950
I feel so gross inside when I go back and forth with somebody.

3026
02:44:19.951 --> 02:44:22.150
We were talking about that before.
You feel shitty.
I know.

3027
02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:24.640
And I deal with it a lot being an entertainer.

3028
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:28.540
So I imagine when people deal with back and forth online that it's sort of a

3029
02:44:28.541 --> 02:44:30.730
shitty feeling and they don't necessarily want that.

3030
02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:33.190
They sort of want the accolades for their opinions.

3031
02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:37.180
<v 1>Do they want that?
But they also,
it's addictive.
The conflict is addictive.</v>

3032
02:44:37.181 --> 02:44:39.670
It's like you're almost like you're playing a game.
You know,

3033
02:44:39.671 --> 02:44:42.050
you're saying something shitty to them and they're say Sam,

3034
02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:44.050
say something back to you shitty.

3035
02:44:44.051 --> 02:44:48.730
And then they insult you and you insult them and you post a Google article that

3036
02:44:48.731 --> 02:44:49.460
refutes there.
Right.

3037
02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:53.390
<v 2>Go,
go article.
But it's conflict.</v>

3038
02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:58.560
<v 1>Look,
you can get,
you can serendipitously,
is that the right word?
Yeah.</v>

3039
02:44:58.790 --> 02:45:00.800
Serendipitously,
serendipitously,
um,

3040
02:45:00.970 --> 02:45:05.080
you could stumble across some brilliant piece of something on Twitter and you

3041
02:45:05.081 --> 02:45:08.490
definitely can learn something and you definitely get some information on
candor.

3042
02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:09.970
Facts happens all the time.

3043
02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:14.560
You can also get sucked into some abortion debate that each your life for

3044
02:45:14.561 --> 02:45:18.310
another ax seven days and you start trying to figure out who's right or who's

3045
02:45:18.311 --> 02:45:20.530
wrong.
And w what,
what position to take.

3046
02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:25.770
Abortion is one of the most human subjects in that humans are so,

3047
02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:33.600
we're so weird in so many ways were so unusual and irregular and we don't,

3048
02:45:38.090 --> 02:45:41.260
we're inconsistent in a lot of the ways we look at things.

3049
02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:43.180
But the abortion one is a crazy one.

3050
02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:47.110
You're literally talking about stopping a human life while it's inside of a

3051
02:45:47.111 --> 02:45:48.580
person.
And then you're,

3052
02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.210
you're talking about whether or not you have the decision to tell someone that

3053
02:45:52.211 --> 02:45:54.970
they can stop a life inside of their body.
And everybody's like,

3054
02:45:54.971 --> 02:45:55.810
that's not what it is.

3055
02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:59.700
That stuff and people like try to redefine it in some strange way like no,
no,
no.

3056
02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:02.290
It's a woman's choice.
It is.
It is a woman's choice.

3057
02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:05.230
But what is it a woman's choice to do?
Yeah.

3058
02:46:05.231 --> 02:46:09.560
To decide whether or not a life stays in her body and becomes a person or not.

3059
02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:14.510
And when do you get to decide when a PR,
but this is not as simple clean thing.

3060
02:46:14.511 --> 02:46:19.511
It's a simple clean thing in my terms in my mind is in terms of what I'm able to

3061
02:46:19.521 --> 02:46:22.220
tell anybody what to do and I wouldn't want to,

3062
02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:24.530
but if you just look as a human,

3063
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:29.950
if someone is having an abortion and the baby is a healthy baby,

3064
02:46:30.860 --> 02:46:34.890
that's pretty close to being born and like when is it okay?
I think every,

3065
02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:37.910
most people think it's okay with,
there's like two cells,
right?

3066
02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:41.540
There's only two cells or four cells or t and they start dividing.

3067
02:46:41.730 --> 02:46:43.040
But at one point in time,

3068
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:47.030
there's a line where it's one of those inside of the woman's body.

3069
02:46:47.031 --> 02:46:51.140
And also you think about this like whatever that line is,
everyone,
right?

3070
02:46:51.141 --> 02:46:52.970
Let's say you're pro choice,

3071
02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:56.480
you have a line where one second ago it wasn't okay,

3072
02:46:56.540 --> 02:46:58.960
but this and this exact second it is okay.
Right.

3073
02:46:59.090 --> 02:47:02.180
Which is sort of fucking crazy in itself,
you know?
So it's like,

3074
02:47:02.181 --> 02:47:05.810
it's crazy in terms of if you talk about a late term abortion,

3075
02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:10.550
well that's just how nice.
Yeah.
How late is this?
Like what are we saying?
I mean,

3076
02:47:10.551 --> 02:47:13.100
and this is a,
this is a terrifying thing for people.
This,

3077
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:18.110
this idea that we can make these decisions and rationalize them and decide

3078
02:47:18.381 --> 02:47:21.140
fourth person whether or not they should have to raise a child or whether they

3079
02:47:21.141 --> 02:47:25.260
can stop it because it hadn't seen air yet.
It's such a fucking,
uh,

3080
02:47:25.530 --> 02:47:28.340
[inaudible] it just wants you to have a kid.
It changes everything.

3081
02:47:28.341 --> 02:47:32.090
Because I saw my kids heartbeat every Puerto Rican instinct.

3082
02:47:32.091 --> 02:47:34.880
I had to have a baby kicked in.
I was like,
we're having this fucking baby.

3083
02:47:34.881 --> 02:47:36.890
That's that.
Cause when we went to the doctor,

3084
02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:40.220
we weren't a hundred percent positive.
We were going to keep my son.
It was,

3085
02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:43.970
it was a debate much more on her.
And I was,
it really is Latinos.

3086
02:47:43.971 --> 02:47:47.370
We just fucking want to spread our seed.
Cause I really,
I just,
Eh,

3087
02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:50.060
she got pregnant and that was that.
And then I saw the heartbeat and I was like,

3088
02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:52.070
that's a baby right there.
I'm watching.

3089
02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:54.950
It's just a little flickering on a screen,
but I'm just like,

3090
02:47:54.951 --> 02:47:59.750
what do want me to say?
That's a heartbeat.
Um,
however,
you know,

3091
02:47:59.751 --> 02:48:02.820
there's a lot of,
there's a,
there's some crazy shit I organized.

3092
02:48:03.090 --> 02:48:06.170
It's a lot of religious stuff attached to it.
You know,

3093
02:48:06.171 --> 02:48:09.590
people don't want anybody to enforce their own religious beliefs as what

3094
02:48:09.591 --> 02:48:11.000
abortion is,
you know?

3095
02:48:11.001 --> 02:48:13.370
And especially when you're dealing with something that's like,

3096
02:48:13.530 --> 02:48:15.890
you're just a week,
two weeks,
whatever it is.

3097
02:48:15.891 --> 02:48:19.250
When they like people think of it as just a cluster of cells.

3098
02:48:19.251 --> 02:48:22.820
Like why is that so bad to stop this and its tracks.
By the way,

3099
02:48:22.821 --> 02:48:24.950
I also think of it as a cluster of cells.

3100
02:48:24.951 --> 02:48:26.870
And if I had to put myself into a category,

3101
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:29.820
I would put myself into the pro choice category.
Um,

3102
02:48:30.770 --> 02:48:34.880
I think we need to decide for,
first of all,

3103
02:48:34.881 --> 02:48:37.590
men can't get pregnant.
Men can get pregnant.
I used to have a joke about it.

3104
02:48:38.650 --> 02:48:42.860
You'd be able to get an abortion on your phone.
Literally.

3105
02:48:42.861 --> 02:48:46.130
It would be an APP.
I used to have this bit about it because it's true.
If a man,

3106
02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:50.400
men like they had a cold pull out your phone,
go fuck this kid.
I'm not any kids.

3107
02:48:50.401 --> 02:48:51.920
It's too annoying not dealing with it.
Yeah.

3108
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:56.590
It's not that we should be able to tell a woman whether or not she can or she

3109
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:59.090
can't do it.
It's just looking at it for what it actually is.

3110
02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:02.810
I don't think we have any right to tell a woman what she can or can't do.

3111
02:49:03.170 --> 02:49:07.170
But looking at it for what it is,
it's,
I mean,

3112
02:49:07.171 --> 02:49:08.280
it is not a clean

3113
02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:12.300
<v 0>thing.
It's a strange thing and it's why I say it's one of the most human things.</v>

3114
02:49:12.370 --> 02:49:16.800
Yeah.
Because it's a,
it's what even the animals don't have that choice.

3115
02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:21.630
You can't deny what she,
I had a cat when I was 11 and uh,
it was just,

3116
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:24.090
we were garbage so she like fucked her son.

3117
02:49:24.091 --> 02:49:28.320
So she had a bunch of retarded cats with back backwards legs and I watch my cat

3118
02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:33.000
eat those kittens.
Oh,
so it's a yeah,
it's pretty human.
The debate.

3119
02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:37.890
It would have been a conversation with humans.
Yeah,
I've seen that.
Um,

3120
02:49:38.010 --> 02:49:40.620
that animals do that.
I had a hamster that did that one.

3121
02:49:40.621 --> 02:49:43.950
She ate her babies and we were like,
what the fuck?

3122
02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:48.750
We looked at she pro choice this hamster.
Nope.
She's not pro choice.
Right.

3123
02:49:48.860 --> 02:49:51.730
It was a choice to eat their babies.
Um,

3124
02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:55.950
she carved a whole lot of this baby's head and she was chewing on it.

3125
02:49:55.950 --> 02:49:58.240
We looked in,
I never thought of that.
Hampshire the same way again.

3126
02:49:58.290 --> 02:50:02.490
Like that is all pretty rat.
That dirty little thing kills babies.

3127
02:50:02.850 --> 02:50:07.210
What in the hell?
They get some sort of a disease apparently.
And uh,

3128
02:50:07.290 --> 02:50:09.900
if they get that disease they'll often just kill their babies.

3129
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:14.310
Hamsters has a regular two.
There was rough.
We were a little too.

3130
02:50:14.311 --> 02:50:16.940
We were like six,
seven.
My sister were like,

3131
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:19.020
it's all fun way to learn about death.

3132
02:50:20.350 --> 02:50:24.600
These things either babies said we were so happy that they had babies.

3133
02:50:24.601 --> 02:50:27.300
Like oh my God,
it's going to be a Munis little thing.
By the way,
baby hamsters,

3134
02:50:27.301 --> 02:50:28.860
Dorothy,
they look like little fingers.

3135
02:50:28.861 --> 02:50:30.510
They're just cute and pink and they're just fucking,

3136
02:50:30.511 --> 02:50:34.980
their eyes are closed and yeah,
it was like wet tale.
I think it was the disease.

3137
02:50:35.010 --> 02:50:39.030
I think that's what it was called.
Yeah,
it turned out she had,
yeah,
no,

3138
02:50:39.090 --> 02:50:41.460
I don't remember where we got her pet store or some shit.

3139
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:45.740
I don't need any of those pets.
I Dunno.
Peck guys.

3140
02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:49.030
It is looking up an article about it and it just says that like especially in

3141
02:50:49.031 --> 02:50:49.471
the first time,

3142
02:50:49.471 --> 02:50:52.680
mothers stress and fear associated with rewriting the babies can be too much to

3143
02:50:52.681 --> 02:50:56.700
handle so she just kills them all.
Jesus,

3144
02:51:00.170 --> 02:51:04.770
that's hamsters.
Hamsters,
a lot with animals,
dogs,
cats.

3145
02:51:04.771 --> 02:51:06.570
They kill their babies.
They eat them sometimes

3146
02:51:09.570 --> 02:51:12.450
the most fucked up one.
It's bears cause bears.

3147
02:51:12.451 --> 02:51:16.900
They'll go into dens looking for babies.
Babies.
So a,

3148
02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:19.750
well the predators,
you watch this Predator shows where like,
you know,

3149
02:51:19.770 --> 02:51:23.640
a bunch of fucking hyenas there was looking for like a baby antelope.
Yeah.

3150
02:51:23.641 --> 02:51:27.990
But baby bears like bears eat bears.
Oh,
bears.
He pairs cannibals.

3151
02:51:28.020 --> 02:51:31.620
They eat little cubs.
Ah,
eat the shit out of Ah,
no.

3152
02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:35.700
It's quite sad and bear death seems pretty horrific.
I never even saw that movie.

3153
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:41.550
The revenant where like the Paris one was brutal scene.
Never fake one.

3154
02:51:41.551 --> 02:51:44.820
You got to see grizzly man,
they have the video from getting eaten that,
oh no,
no,

3155
02:51:44.821 --> 02:51:49.530
no grizzly man has this disappears.
A gay guy that moves to Alaska to uh,

3156
02:51:49.580 --> 02:51:53.070
to save the bears and one of them eats him and his girlfriend.

3157
02:51:53.130 --> 02:51:57.810
It is a crazy film.
It's a Werner Herzog documentary.
It's unintentional comedy.

3158
02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:00.480
I mean it's,
I think the way it's edited.

3159
02:52:00.481 --> 02:52:03.870
He had to know there's a certain point in time where it's like obvious comedic

3160
02:52:03.871 --> 02:52:07.420
timing.
He edited.
It seemed like a lot of it was tongue and cheek,

3161
02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:10.720
but it's about a really crazy guy,
Timothy Treadwell,

3162
02:52:10.750 --> 02:52:14.830
who's lived with the bears for like hundreds and hundreds of days and had all

3163
02:52:14.831 --> 02:52:18.420
this video footage of him like really close to big giant grizzly bears and she

3164
02:52:18.421 --> 02:52:20.620
has a story and it was like a eventually ate them.
Yeah,

3165
02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:22.810
it became a sort of a meme.
They'll do that.

3166
02:52:22.900 --> 02:52:24.820
Eventually you're gonna run into a bear that's like,
Hey,
you know what?

3167
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:27.910
They'll beat the fuck out of you today.
It's a great documentary.

3168
02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.240
I love to watch it.
I am.
Bears eat their cubs.
There's a,

3169
02:52:31.241 --> 02:52:34.810
there's video of this may maybe the guy at like a Russian zoo who jumps into the

3170
02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:39.811
bear cage and there's this video of this bear eating this man and it's just,

3171
02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:47.140
it looks,
it looks every bit like the most horrible thing in the world.

3172
02:52:47.141 --> 02:52:49.070
Like that is the way that I don't want to go pee.

3173
02:52:49.071 --> 02:52:50.560
Always talking about how would you want to go?
It's like,

3174
02:52:50.561 --> 02:52:53.410
I know how I don't want to go as being eaten alive by a bear because they will

3175
02:52:53.411 --> 02:52:56.320
eat you guts first.
You know,
you'll,
you'll still be alive.

3176
02:52:56.321 --> 02:52:59.710
They'll be tearing your guts apart.
Yeah.
There are so big,

3177
02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:02.750
I look a Grizzly,
a grizzly bear.

3178
02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:05.950
We don't even understand how big that is.

3179
02:53:06.250 --> 02:53:09.940
It's got a 900 pound super dog,
you know,

3180
02:53:09.970 --> 02:53:12.670
not matching a 900 pound dog that wants to kill you.
That's bear.

3181
02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:16.690
I get very scared cause you,
you know,
I know you run with your dog in the hills.

3182
02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.370
Have you uh,
got to look out for cats.
Yeah.
Shit.

3183
02:53:21.371 --> 02:53:23.350
Have you had to deal with any of that shit?
No,

3184
02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:28.060
I was running with a knife though just in case you heard the story about the
guy,

3185
02:53:28.061 --> 02:53:30.740
cause there was the rumor or a couple of years ago about how you choked out a

3186
02:53:30.741 --> 02:53:32.180
cougar or whatever.
It was like a,

3187
02:53:32.181 --> 02:53:35.700
a mountain lion and there was the guy who did in Colorado.
Yeah.

3188
02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:39.110
Killed him one time I was a baby,
Brian Callanan.

3189
02:53:39.130 --> 02:53:41.830
Brendan Schaub was shitting all over.
That guy was saying he was a baby.

3190
02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:44.320
They called it a long time ago.

3191
02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:47.920
They called it like Rinella was saying it was 85 pounds and I was saying,

3192
02:53:47.921 --> 02:53:52.120
I heard it was 85 pounds and then Jamie googled it and he found 35 pounds and I

3193
02:53:52.121 --> 02:53:53.680
was like,
Whoa,
that's not as impressive.

3194
02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:57.160
And then now they're saying it was like fuck them up about the cat still.

3195
02:53:57.161 --> 02:53:58.850
Like he was still,
fuck yeah,

3196
02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:02.320
isn't it crazy little a baby cat would think that it could kill a grown person.

3197
02:54:02.530 --> 02:54:06.250
Imagine being something that cocky like you with your face running up to like a

3198
02:54:06.251 --> 02:54:09.730
giraffe and go,
oh,
I got this phone thing.
I'm just going to jump on this tramp.

3199
02:54:10.090 --> 02:54:12.730
I could kill a giraffe and think so I don't think he could.

3200
02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:14.580
You don't leave house?
Oh God,

3201
02:54:16.050 --> 02:54:18.790
this bears just mall and this guy did it kill him.

3202
02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:21.820
That was Khabib's for former training partners and he says,
Christ,

3203
02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:26.410
it doesn't always go well.
Cans tearing them apart.
Okay,
stop Jamie,
stop this.

3204
02:54:26.650 --> 02:54:30.340
Did the Guy Die?
I must've,
yeah,
that doesn't look like it's going to end.

3205
02:54:30.341 --> 02:54:33.880
Well he lived.
Yeah.
Wow.
Oh my God.

3206
02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:35.980
Bears probably never killed anything before.

3207
02:54:36.250 --> 02:54:38.800
Probably just been eating meat that they gave it to.
He's probably,

3208
02:54:38.801 --> 02:54:40.900
what do I do with you?
Yeah,
he's just bad at killings.

3209
02:54:40.901 --> 02:54:42.730
He was just doing it longer and more painfully.

3210
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:45.340
It's like being stabbed with a butter knife condition.

3211
02:54:45.341 --> 02:54:48.580
Yesterday was said to be comfortable.
Oh

3212
02:54:51.580 --> 02:54:55.340
yeah,
but he's got a story now we'll go on tour.
Yeah.

3213
02:54:57.510 --> 02:55:00.970
You think so or else?
Yeah,
there'd be,
yeah.

3214
02:55:01.210 --> 02:55:04.040
If the a bear attack happens guys to start to filter through

3215
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:06.710
<v 3>it,
it's not going to freeze in his tracks for Chrysler had that story.</v>

3216
02:55:06.711 --> 02:55:10.140
That'd be a whole other fucking special.
It would be another 45 minutes.

3217
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:14.600
A machine versus the bear.
Yeah,
the machine versus the bat.
I can see it now.

3218
02:55:15.050 --> 02:55:18.710
He might have to write something to do.
We got to wrap this up.
It's a three gram.

3219
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:22.100
That was fun.
So tell me one more time where they can get your special.

3220
02:55:22.410 --> 02:55:26.510
I can get ever iTunes,
Google play,
Amazon and a directly from our website.

3221
02:55:26.511 --> 02:55:31.280
Gas Digital network.com and you are,
is it Gomez comedy on Instagram?

3222
02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:34.670
Goleman's common against gram.
Lucia Gamez on Twitter.
I'll listen to the pods.

3223
02:55:34.671 --> 02:55:36.620
I got a few positive one with Bisping as well.

3224
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:40.160
I'll call and believe you and believe you me.
Right,
right.
Beautiful Blue Man.

3225
02:55:40.310 --> 02:55:43.070
Thanks.
Good brother,
my brother.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Bye everybody.

3226
02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:46.873
<v 8>That's fine.
Good.</v>

3227
02:55:58.210 --> 02:55:58.340
<v 4>Hmm.</v>
