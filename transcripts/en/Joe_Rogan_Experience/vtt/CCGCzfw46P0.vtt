WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.610
Wow.
We Ladies and gentlemen.
That's right.
We're back.

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.120
And this episode is brought to you by Ting Ting is the official cell phone of

3
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.530
this podcast.
Did you and his pants?
Um,
I like that.

4
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:18.360
Can you show that Caesar when it's taught charging?
This is my,
uh,
my new phone.

5
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:18.991
When it charges,

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.800
it has this little thing that comes up from the charge or that looks like a lava

7
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.240
lamp.
Cool.
I'm 12,
by the way.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.480
I'm fucking child.
But uh,
this,
uh,
this is uh,

9
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.490
the official podcast sponsor phone company and Tang has,
uh,

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.760
sent me this one where I really liked is the Samsung galaxy s five.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.340
And with Ting is,
uh,

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.410
is a cell phone company that uses a sprint backbone way.

13
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:48.120
They do it is they rent time on sprint and then they do it by their rules and by

14
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.100
their rules means no contracts,

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.580
no early termination fees and a very unique way they charge you.

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.500
The way they charge you is like,

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.920
it used to be like if you had x amount of permits per month,

18
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.880
if you went under that you didn't get any money back.
But if you went over that,

19
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.490
you got some sort of overage fee that you were a,

20
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:08.490
you were hit with and it was usually more money for those minutes and it was for

21
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.880
your previous minutes,
which doesn't totally make sense.
Right?
Well,

22
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:15.150
the weights Tim decided to do it was just you pay for whatever you use,

23
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.580
which I think is what everyone's going to do eventually.
I mean we,

24
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.220
we've talked about this ad nauseum on the podcast,

25
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.820
but the best comparison I can make is what it used to be like back in the day

26
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.760
when you used to have what they used to call long distance fees.

27
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.690
He used to call you when I lived in New York and a,

28
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.480
I would call someone that lived in Boston.

29
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.440
I used to have to pay long distance.
It wasn't a local call,

30
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.380
like if you want to call someone in California would cost you more.

31
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.940
It sounds so stupid today,

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.810
but back then that was with regular phones and fucking,

33
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.340
God forbid if you called long distance on your cell phone back then,
good Lord.

34
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:51.100
It was brutal.

35
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.540
<v 1>Was some,</v>

36
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.280
it was so expensive that sometimes you didn't even have enough money to call

37
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.450
somebody and you'd have to call,

38
00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.650
collect and collect calling cards where one of the biggest advertisements in the

39
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.550
rural,
everyone

40
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.290
my mother made me send a letter because she didn't want to pay for long
distance.

41
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.650
That's crazy.
It was in shame cause my shoot belling is show bad.

42
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.930
<v 0>It was super expensive.
Um,</v>

43
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.270
well that's the best analogy that I can make and I think that the way tings

44
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:24.350
doing it eventually,
that's how all mobile companies are going to do it.
Uh,
Tang,

45
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.810
when you want to cancel,
you just cancel.
You own your phone.

46
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:29.750
If you buy your phone from Tang,
they activate it,
you own it.

47
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:33.020
And you can get like,
if you're a Weirdo when you're like fucking flip phones,

48
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:37.610
even have those,
they have the Samsung m 400.
A lot of people are going retro.

49
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:40.070
Brian,
a lot of people are,
they're going with two phones.

50
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.540
They're going with a phone like this,

51
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.630
like the Samsung Galaxy s five for like their Internet shit,

52
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.260
their smart phones for their like email and then they're going flip phone for

53
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.680
calling.
Just call me bitch.
Stop playing games.
Only call me

54
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.420
<v 1>Dana white buys them in boxes.
Old refurbished.
Flip phones.</v>

55
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.750
And didn't you just post something the other day about somebody who only uses

56
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.060
like the founders?

57
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.090
<v 0>Yes,
I did.
Yeah.
Some a guy who's a tech security expert,</v>

58
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.640
he won't use anything but a pager.
Fucking Weirdo.

59
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.790
Well they can get in touch with him and then he has to remembers people's

60
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.220
numbers and then he has to go and buy like a,
a fucking dumper phone.

61
00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:20.270
When I was little phones you buy from like seven 11 he buys one of those calls,

62
00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:23.330
you burns it and that's it and moves on to the next number.

63
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.760
<v 1>But using cell phone towers and triangles and stuff like that,</v>

64
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:28.980
you'd still be able to find out where he is using the page,
right?

65
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.890
<v 0>Oh No,
no,
no,
no page is a different animal.
It's a different animal and it does.</v>

66
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.520
Now the observer transmit like that?
No,
no,

67
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.540
no pager doesn't have gps pages missing a lot of stuff that they need.

68
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.440
Apparently this is obviously I'm talking about my ass.
I don't know Jack Shit,

69
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.540
but according to this security expert,

70
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.900
I think that was a reason why he went with a pager and let's find out.
Let's,

71
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.320
let's go ahead

72
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.520
<v 1>because I know that that that pagers like I guess it sends out a signal going,</v>

73
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:56.580
hey,
call this phone number.
Uh Huh.

74
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.810
And then I guess there's nothing in the pager that says eight received it.
Maybe.

75
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.300
But I think I remember pagers having a,
a receipt,

76
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.741
<v 2>no,</v>

77
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:08.430
I don't remember if she had a whole page or business what's going to go out and

78
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.660
close everything.

79
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.930
But they knew the one guy was still using it so right.

80
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.270
There's still,
everything is still on,
you know,

81
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.800
<v 1>doctors don't,
they doctors still use pagers a lot.
Like if you always,</v>

82
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:23.910
you're at the Er,
you always see their pay.
They still have pages.

83
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.810
<v 0>Just maybe that's like in hospital maybe you can like go further than like cell</v>

84
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:32.210
phone signals when they might not get you.
Does that make anything?
Alright.
No,

85
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.730
I can't find this article.
Uh,
so go,
go,
go get your Fox.
Um,
but the bottom,

86
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.590
the bottom line is the way ting has their cell phone service set up.

87
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.150
It's advantageous to most people.
98% of people would save money with Ting.

88
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.420
And if you go to rogan.ting.com you personally will save 25 bucks off of any of

89
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:56.380
their new awesome devices.
That's rogan.ting.com.
Like I said,

90
00:04:56.381 --> 00:05:00.370
they have all of the,
like the high end android phones,
all the really cool ones.

91
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.030
And iPhone five.
Yeah,
they have iPhone fives.
You can buy them for 250 bucks.

92
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.900
It's pretty goddamn reasonable and not locked into some fucking contract.
Dope.

93
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.080
It's yours in the toilet and stick it up your ass.

94
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.730
<v 1>Do you think all phones in like the next year are going to be waterproof?</v>

95
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.623
Cause it seems like it.

96
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.930
<v 0>Yeah.
That's the other thing I love about this Samsung,
this galaxy has four,</v>

97
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:22.620
has a little tab on the bottom.
You closed the door and it's water resistant,

98
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:24.210
quote unquote meaning that if,

99
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:26.340
I guess if you like open the tab and throw in the water,

100
00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:30.680
it's probably not so good,
but it's better than you know any regular phone.

101
00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:31.830
It's not protecting you.

102
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.301
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:35.030
My friend just dropped hers in the toilet and I told her to suck the water out,

104
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:37.460
but she wouldn't do it.
So now her phone doesn't work.

105
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 0>Oh well that's what backups for me.
I don't have to suck toilet water.</v>

106
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:45.600
If I had choice between sucking toilet water or paying to get my phone replaced,

107
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.990
I might have to go with pain to get my phone replaced over like some horrible

108
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:51.030
intestinal disorder that you get from poop.

109
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.090
<v 2>I won't even drop my phone into soc toilet water.
I mean,</v>

110
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.640
<v 0>how could you just suck it out?
I just don't</v>

111
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.990
<v 1>because it's either like,
Hey,
do you,
do you want to just,
you know,</v>

112
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.450
take some mouthwash later or blog 250 bucks.
Put it in rice.

113
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.450
That's what she did.
But I didn't have any rice.

114
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.300
I only had an old box of rice a Roni,
which should be the same thing,
right?
Yeah,

115
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.000
that's right.
Yeah.
I didn't know if they like put some other shit in a box.

116
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.820
You had a box,
a box of Quaker oatmeal.
Maybe not.

117
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.980
Cause she doesn't say all right.

118
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.450
Maybe if you had fucking popsicles in a freezer,
the keyword is rice.
Yeah.

119
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.750
I don't know if there was like a spice on that shit or not.

120
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.080
I don't even know why.
There's definitely some spices on it.
Right.

121
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.960
I don't know what rights erroneous.
Really.
Cisco Tree.

122
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.270
That was like a big commercial where kids,
right.

123
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:45.830
So Rony the San Francisco treat it,
but why,
why just San Francisco?

124
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.840
I have no idea.
It doesn't make sense.
Charlie's in the logo,
I think,
but why?

125
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.390
Maybe they invented it there.
Yeah.

126
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.310
<v 0>Invented it.
I mean,
what the fuck was rice a Roni?
Is that shit still around?</v>

127
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.630
Just spicy rice,
right?
It's just yummy rice.
Which fuck.
Anyway,

128
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:03.620
rogan.st Com we're also brought to you by on it.
That's o.
N N.
I t.

129
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:07.920
Last commercial on it is a human optimization website.
Uh,

130
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.100
I've seen this commercial so many times.

131
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.530
It sounds like a robot thing coming out of my mouth.

132
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:16.430
But what we try to do with on it is to sell the very best strength and

133
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:20.270
conditioning equipment,
the very best supplements.
The very,
it's fun.

134
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:25.070
It's like protein supplements or cognitive function supplements like Alpha

135
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:26.030
brainer,
shroom tech,

136
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.040
all of it with references and research to whatever these individual supplements

137
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:32.840
are supposed to do,
like new mood,

138
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:37.130
the five HTP and l tryptofan supplement that actually boosts your serotonin.

139
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.520
There are certain products that you could take that vitamins,

140
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.050
certain supplements,
certain certain,
uh,

141
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.970
various nutrients that have been shown to have a direct effect on all various

142
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:51.100
aspects of your body.
It's strength and conditioning and endurance.
Um,

143
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.380
the way your brain functions and all of these studies that have been done are

144
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.010
all available for your,
your,
um,

145
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.680
discovery at [inaudible] dot com or you're a research if you're interested or

146
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.640
curious as to what all these things for about.
We also know that they're kind of,

147
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.170
these are controversial subjects saying things like performance enhancers for

148
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.350
your brain is a lot like saying big dick pills to some people,

149
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.780
they automatically,
their bullshit alarm goes off and it should.

150
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.580
But there are certain nutrients that are called nootropics and it's pretty much

151
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:24.581
scientifically proven that they have an effect on cognitive function.

152
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.820
It's been with double blind placebo tests,
um,

153
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.270
both on individual ingredients and unlike Alpha brain as a,
as a competent Tory,

154
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.840
a supplement all if you're interested or you're curious in,
in any way,

156
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:43.700

First 30 pills.
You have 90 days to just say,

157
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.940
I just didn't do shit for me.
You don't have to return the bottle.

158
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.890
You don't have to do anything.
You get your money back.

159
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:53.300
Our goal is to just establish a relationship with you where you were selling you

160

the very best products that can find that aid you,

161
00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:59.910
whether it's for conditioning,

162
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.630
like kettle bells and battle ropes and all these different things that,
uh,

163
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.010
various tools that a lot of different people are using now for a strength and

164
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.740
conditioning on.
It has this new guy's name is John Wolf.

165
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.390
He's going to design all these courses for all these exercises,
for all these,
um,

166
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.180
different,
um,
various,
uh,
strength and conditioning tools.

167
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.050
And he put me through this fucking ridiculous workout.
When I was in Austin,

168
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.360
it was all like hips.
Everything he made me do is my hips.
It's,
it's so weird.

169
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:30.840
Like my ass was hurting the weirdest way.
Like my thigh,
upper,
upper,

170
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.550
upper thighs and hips were hurting.

171
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.340
<v 1>What can he do with baby making hips?
Cause I need to get rid of these.</v>

172
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.130
<v 0>Uh,
he can make your baby making him well,
look,
if you want to get rid of a man,</v>

173
00:09:39.131 --> 00:09:41.590
you just got to stop eating so much.
That's super simple.

174
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.210
<v 1>Did it all right can thing is fucking dying.
Everybody's sitting here going,</v>

175
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.480
I'm going to cry.
I mean,
I work out because this and that.
Look,

176
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:52.800
you fucking buffet molesters,
stop fucking eating and you won't gain weight.

177
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.010
<v 0>Yeah.
And you'll lose weight.</v>

178
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:56.380
But it's hard to lose weight because if you lose weight,
you have to suffer.

179
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.520
Is this,

180
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.880
the bottom line is you have to consume less calories in your body is burning.

181
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.620
There's all sorts of ways you can trick your body,

182
00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:05.500
but the reality is you're going to want to eat more always.

183
00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:08.590
So you're going to suffer in a sense because you're going to have that sense.

184
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:10.540
And you're like,
fuck,
I would love a burger right now.

185
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.810
<v 1>God Damn it is this guy who will,
uh,
is that his real last name?
Yeah,</v>

186
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.030
<v 0>his real name.
I know.
It's funny,
the wolf pack,
he's a super,
super nice guy.</v>

187
00:10:19.031 --> 00:10:22.210
I put a picture of him up on my Instagram.
Um,
but uh,
the,

188
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:26.770
the workout we had was just so stupid,
ridiculous.
All these weird getups,

189
00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:29.200
all these different things that we did from the hips.

190
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.740
And it makes me think like your hips are involved in so many different,
um,

191
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.960
things that you do athletically,
martial arts.
Uh,

192
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.580
obviously if you're throwing a ball or you know,
doing any sort of sport,

193
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.390
a lot of is you pushing off the ground and moving your hips.
It's incredible.

194
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.271
Like the,

195
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:47.550
the different workouts that people have devised in order to strengthen like

196
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.100
certain areas that really never get hit.
He's gotta be doing John,

197
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:54.400
we'll be doing a bunch of videos that'll be up and available at [inaudible] dot

Young Brian,

221
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.920
<v 2>the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

222
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.830
<v 3>Joe Rogan podcast by night.
All Day.
Which boss?</v>

223
00:12:22.831 --> 00:12:23.470
We've known each other

224
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.150
<v 0>for decades.
Sir,
take your time,
but a long time.
You're one of those guys,</v>

225
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.580
I ran into you in the,
in the airport.
I get a giant smile on my face.
You know,

226
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.410
<v 2>I remember us walking along,</v>

227
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.810
walking along before we're doing a one night or in seaside with my ex wife.

228
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.231
I just,

229
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:43.231
when I was married to my ex wife and we're doing some shitty one nighter and uh,

230
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.500
talking taekwondo and karate and just,

231
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.470
I clicked with this guy right from the beginning.
You just shun comics,
you know,

232
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.390
like initially Keith raw machines line.
But it's so true.
There's great guy.

233
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.250
I love it.
They're back at a bus comics.
When they went to school,

234
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.400
they sat in the back of the bus,
you know what I mean?

235
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.390
They weren't the front of the bus fucking dudes.
Right.
And like,
you know,

236
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:14.110
like Rogan was a back of the bus walking guy,
you know,

237
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.300
and just back in the bus people,
you know,
look,
if I'm,

238
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.680
if I'm at a party and I'm one shot at a room is doctors,

239
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:25.210
lawyers and,
and,

240
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.590
and scientists and other side of the room is convict hookers.

241
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.860
And you know,
I'm going to go talk to the convicts and Hookers,

242
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.650
you know they're going to be more interested.
Give me more.
Interesting.

243
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.990
So you know that would comics too.
You could feel that with comics.

244
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.010
Who's more interesting,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
So shall,
and,

245
00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:47.860
and then,
then we used to do danger fields together.
Those are great gigs.

246
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.170
Like in danger field.
He didn't prom shows did we?

247
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:53.050
Did you know how many prompts shows that we do at Dangerfield?

248
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.010
They would keep them going.
The prom shows,
hey,
would you like for a night?

249
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.470
But they wouldn't stop them.

250
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.330
It would just keep bringing people in and then we just keep rotating the comics.

251
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.430
So you'd be on stage and there was still be palm kids on the next show that they

252
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.670
kept rotating.
They haven't left yet,
you know,
and there's not like,

253
00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:14.890
I had more material.

254
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.920
I just shame the shame bullshit I had the first time I was up there and they're

255
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:24.730
just rotten little kid that fucking have nowhere to go.

256
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.490
They're not going down the shore because whatever.

257
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.510
And I got to under a prom the whole time there.
Half of them are drunk.

258
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.970
They think you're going to get laid or want to get laid.

259
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.240
And I'm going to tell my horrible jokes,
which were horrible at that time.

260
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.200
Most likely too.
So it was just one big fucking horrible experience.

261
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.890
<v 0>Yeah,
I remember those shows really well man.
They,</v>

262
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.370
they've told you to do the same material so that you would kick the people out

263
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:48.540
so they would just get bored with you.

264
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.010
Go do the same material for the first show,
but you can't tell me what

265
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.360
<v 4>to do.
Like if you hire me for a show,
you don't get to tell me.
I can't,
you know,</v>

266
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.000
I can do different material on all four shows.

267
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.450
Cause if a guy had like rich Jenny rich Jenny was famous for,

268
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:05.990
he used to do the east side a comedy club and uh,
was it Huntington?

269
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.710
Huntington Long.
Yeah.
And Jenny like they would go,

270
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:13.100
he did four different hours on the weekend.
He did two shows on Friday,

271
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:14.540
two shows on Saturday.
He goes,

272
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.390
it was one of the guys who was working that think it was Brad Garrett.

273
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.330
I might be speaking out of school,
but I think it was Brad Garrett who was also,

274
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.060
I know he was a big fan of Jenny's.
Everybody was back then.

275
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.580
Jenny [inaudible] was the man.
He was the man.
A lot of folks don't know that.
He,

276
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.810
that guy doesn't get enough credit.
No,

277
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:34.250
not in the 80s he's probably the top 20 best comics ever.
Ever.
Yeah,
I agree.

278
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:34.641
I agree.

279
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:39.230
100% I think Jenny back in those days was peaking and for whatever reason,

280
00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:40.220
I don't think

281
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.950
much of the Americans like to have today.
Remember that for whatever reason,

282
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.210
I don't know why.
I wish I was booking.
When I first started comedy,

283
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.500
I booked a couple one nighters,
just sway.
I would get stage time.

284
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.810
I would host again other,
you know,
Jim Moshe had one nighters that stunk,

285
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.490
you know,
I let them do mine.
I would do those show you get work,
you know,

286
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:07.760
like back then it was no Selman all these one nighters in Jersey.

287
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.390
So I remember hiring a Mulrooney.

288
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:15.020
The headline Tahmo Rooney shall,
he came in,
he goes,

289
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:19.850
I'll bring my own opening act.
Saw Him there and the guy,
I go,
what's your name?

290
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:23.630
He goes,
ah,
Amish,
Jenny.
Uh,
I don't know if you know,

291
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:27.620
but I work catch a rising star I got while you're working here for 50 fucking

292
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:31.280
dollars.
Okay.
And he was bummed out that you didn't know who he was.

293
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.450
He always just starting.
We were all,
you know,
he was,

294
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.700
but he act like he already knew that he was great,
but he know,

295
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.980
but he was opening from old Rooney,
but he was like,
Jenny,
oh good.

296
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.380
You're getting 50 fucking nine.
Right.
Don't act like Jim Mulrooney.
Wow.

297
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:52.410
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.
Uh,
he,
um,

298
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.930
he like Robin Williams committed suicide,
that,
that bombed a lot of folks out.

299
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.960
That bummed me on hardcore man.
He was brilliant when we,

300
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.450
when we worked on the Oscars for Chris,
when Chris was hosting the Oscars,
uh,

301
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:08.360
he was one of the writers.
I was one of them.
He was like,
you know,

302
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.530
a writing staff are down.

303
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.230
And Jenny was the most honest to Chris.
You know,
people would go,
wouldn't say go,

304
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:20.210
Nah,
you can't do that or no,
that won't work.
You know,

305
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.960
we would throw Chris Lines or you know,
this or dad or maybe do it.

306
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.050
But he would flat out and that,

307
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.470
and Chris respected the fact that this fucking dude knows what he's talking

308
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:33.800
about.
He has a great mind for comedy.
Richard,

309
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:37.340
Jenny can take any subject and turn it into a 10 minute pit.
Just,

310
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:40.920
you can take a bit about shopping for a car.
He had a bit about it.
He was in,

311
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.680
in Montreal at the comedy works.

312
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:45.320
It's during just for laughs during the comedy festival,

313
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.220
like a lot of comics will go around town and they do shows all over Montreal.

314
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.100
And Jimbo

315
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.940
<v 5>was comedy works in Montreal is like maybe 90 seats,
right?</v>

316
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.090
Maybe a hundred seats at the most.
And a rich,

317
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:02.010
Jenny did this fucking 10 minute bit on just buying a new car and it was

318
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:06.300
destroying.
It's like punchline after punchline,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.

319
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.520
Setting up the guy,
setting up,
uh,

320
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:12.360
you know how to sell the car to him and it was fucking genius.
And you like,

321
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:15.360
who the fuck writes a joke about buying a car?
You know what I mean?

322
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.930
It's like there's not much there.
Like if you thought,
if you,
you know,
he said,

323
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:22.290
hey,
uh,
I wrote a jug about buying a car.
I'd be like,
what'd you say?

324
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.900
Like what do you,
what are you saying?
10 minute chunk.

325
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.400
<v 2>He was,
he was Hicks was like that too.
I worked with [inaudible] in Texas.</v>

326
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.130
I mean this is,
I was getting high so 29 years ago,

327
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:36.510
30 you know?
Wow.

328
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.600
And something happened to him in seven 11 and he went on stage and ad Lib to

329
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.820
about it the next night for tea.
And I'm going,

330
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.240
I'll never be that funny as long as I fucking live.
I'll never be that.

331
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.300
Why am I doing this?
Do you ever see him when he was like 18

332
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.830
now

333
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.510
<v 5>video of him,
he's a teenager,</v>

334
00:18:55.511 --> 00:18:59.560
I want to say you might have been earlier than 18 it might've actually been like

335
00:18:59.561 --> 00:19:04.150
16 I think.
And he was really good.
Who was smooth?

336
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.300
He was wavering and I was like my first year at 21 he and he had been doing it

337
00:19:09.491 --> 00:19:11.520
apparently even in this video,
we've been doing it

338
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.050
<v 2>quite a while.
At 18 we were at catch a rising star in New York one night.</v>

339
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.050
So Brenner goes on.
And this is,

340
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.300
I mean they love Brenner was fucking bread or at the time.
Yeah.

341
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.960
Cause he was a big act back then.
Big fucking act.

342
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.610
So ladies and John Deere Brenner kills the fucking audience,
goes nuts.
Okay.

343
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.000
So does his set and hex goes on after him Hicks opens up with,

344
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.031
you know,
I,

345
00:19:40.031 --> 00:19:45.031
I was growing up and I used to watch comedy on TV and I'd watch Robert Klein and

346
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:49.230
David Brennan.
I'm thinking if these fucking guys can do with,
so can I,

347
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.030
that's his opening fucking joke.

348
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.860
He goes into that Nancy Reagan that anorexic can to sell.

349
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.180
So people are running out like there was a fire.
I mean,

350
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:05.010
he's just fucking cunt.
And I mean it's the comic and he gets off stage.

351
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.630
I swear to God,
he walked up to me.
He fuck what happened?
What went wrong?
Oh,

352
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:10.380
I don't know.

353
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.380
Maybe the anorexic content trashing the guy that they just fucking loved and he

354
00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:21.840
was so fucking dark,
just dark,
just Wah.
You know what I mean?

355
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:25.140
It's just like if you listened to her,
now you're going to have,
that's all right.

356
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:29.730
But this is fucking 30 years ago,
this is 30 years ago,

357
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:34.110
this shit was fucking dark.
You know,
Jenny would take a bit,

358
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:37.380
he would take a premise like you say,
and you know,
it could,

359
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.610
he could turn it into 20 fucking minutes.
He would bring shit out of like,

360
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.630
how the fuck did he come up with that added that you're going,
what?

361
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.330
You know what I mean?
Uh,
but Hicks was so fucking dark and he just,

362
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.520
we,
we're in fucking Texas.
This is a true story.
So he,

363
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.200
his girlfriend just broke up with him.
He was going out with her forever.

364
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.310
So we're in a cab and he said to the cab driver,
I want to hooker in tech.

365
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.270
And we're in Lubbock in Lubbock.
It's a true story.
So,
oh man.

366
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.670
So that made me shiver.
Just thinking about it.
So,

367
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.090
so the cab drivers had,
okay,

368
00:21:15.091 --> 00:21:18.250
I'll take you to one plate on and you go to their house.

369
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:23.450
So I was just going to wait in the cab like so he wants you to first house and

370
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.850
the lady opened the door and looked at him,
goes,
see a cops,

371
00:21:26.851 --> 00:21:30.280
slammed the door excuse back in the car

372
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.050
dad,
but didn't,
it makes no sense,
Kevin.
I would chase him to another place.

373
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.520
She opens the door and goes,
you're too young.
Slams the door,
gets him to call.

374
00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:44.500
He goes,
I can't get fucking hookers.

375
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:49.930
Me 10 minutes to the next night to brilliant fucking on hookers.

376
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:54.590
That won't fuck up
in local taxes.

377
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.380
Just fucking brilliant.
I'm going,
it's unbelievable how fucking good this guy is.

378
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.910
<v 5>He,
he was going over a list of all the comics that were appearing at the comedy</v>

379
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:08.320
connection and uh,
he's like,
let's see what's on the line up here.

380
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.230
He Goes,
Oh look,
carrot tops coming.
And he goes,

381
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.210
that's for folks who think I like Galler boot Gallagher.
I fucked it up.
Ready?

382
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.980
He goes,
I like Gallagher,
but he's too heady.
Who's been way better?

383
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:25.830
If I didn't stumble,
God damn mother fucker.
That's all right.
Yeah,

384
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.370
we got we,
but you know what I'm saying?

385
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.730
But I ruined a great joke from a great guy that's dead,

386
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:35.350
so I'm extra stupid for doing that.
But uh,
yeah,
he,
he was,
uh,

387
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.560
at the Nick's comedy stop and me and a Simmons and I think McGuire was there

388
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:40.931
too.

389
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:45.130
We're in the back of the room and there was maybe 10 other comics that have come

390
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:47.870
in to see him and he went on after this guy,
uh,

391
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.330
Larry Norton comic on a Harley and Larry Norton is very nice guy,

392
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.550
but he does his bit that he closed with about cartoon characters smoking pot.

393
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.870
Okay.
So he does a spit.
It's destroying and Hicks goes on stage.

394
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.530
And I mean,
from the moment he went on stage,

395
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.470
it was just a slow progression of people getting up and moving and getting up

396
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.230
and leaving,
getting up and leaving.

397
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.620
And there's a one point time where he's doing this bit about Satan fucking John

398
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.910
Davidson in the ass.
You remember John Davidson from,

399
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:23.911
that's incredible that that was after the anorexic con that he did

400
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.870
and he does.
He does the,

401
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.190
the John Davidson shitting out today was Oprah Winfrey.

402
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:36.070
It was different people on different days.
Some days it was Morton Downey Jr,

403
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.430
you know antichrist.
Yeah.
And he's,

404
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.900
he's like hovering over this hopeful like going,
ah,

405
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.770
I mean for minutes it,
it was so uncomfortable.

406
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:52.790
I just got to turn this fucking thing off.
It was so uncomfortable and funny.

407
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.630
Like comics are going,
this is the funniest thing about comics.
Loved it.

408
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.000
That's what was going to say.
The people were getting up and leaving in droves,

409
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:00.860
but at the end of the show there was maybe 50 people.

410
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.880
The audience that we're laughing and all the comics and the 200 plus people that

411
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:10.760
had left,
you know,
that we're gone missed out on some really ridiculous shit.

412
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:11.810
It was really funny.

413
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.410
He's shitting making that shitting sound for minutes and he looks up and he
goes,

414
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.020
yeah,
it's generally Claire's a room.

415
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.990
It didn't seem to bother him at all and that's what really I was really

416
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:24.830
impressed with.
I'm like,

417
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:29.300
this guy is eating it and the clearing the room and he's just sticking to his

418
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.960
guns.
Do you know what that thing that guys do when you feel someone when they're

419
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:37.490
bombing,
when they start panicking,
they start rushing and which doesn't work.

420
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.250
It's like the opposite because it lets people know that you're in a panic,

421
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:45.200
you know?
He knew he had none of that.
I mean,
he had that,

422
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.680
I guess that's,
uh,
that's how it is.
And just kept going.
I mean,

423
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:56.450
there was no,
no,
like,
no,
don't anxiety to his performance at all.

424
00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.190
<v 2>Well,
because in his head,
the people that are staying in love it and that's,</v>

425
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.380
he's working through,
that's his crowd.
He's going,
he knew

426
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.130
he was smarter than he knew his audience to build a,
you know,

427
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.330
that's what you're going to do.
He never fucking broke CAG bro.
He was,

428
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.700
and B got his fan base and he weeded out the fucking,

429
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.623
you know,

430
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.130
<v 5>did I ever tell you that I had a conversation with Jay Leno about him?
No,</v>

431
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.990
this was,
um,
I did the tonight show and the first time I did the tonight show,

432
00:25:28.991 --> 00:25:30.610
the one thing that I really wanted to know,

433
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.840
I really wanted to meet Jay Leno cause uh,
I just,
uh,

434
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.620
from back in the 1970s and 1980s for folks who don't know,

435
00:25:38.621 --> 00:25:43.570
Jay Leno was a very respected comedian.
Jay Leno was like,
he was a killer.

436
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.500
He was a really good young comic.
He's do spots on Letterman.
He was very edgy.

437
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.190
He was,
uh,

438
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.820
he was not the Jay Leno that everybody associates with being like this,

439
00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:56.110
a middle America,
super sweet,
friendly host of the tonight show.

440
00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.010
So I always wanted to meet him because I just had to respect as a standup and

441
00:26:00.011 --> 00:26:00.251
two,

442
00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:04.750
because I wanted to know what the fuck was the Hicks thing because Hixon him had

443
00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:09.751
this crazy issue where he exited this whole bit about Jay Leno having Joey

444
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.880
Lawrence on his show.
And Joey Lawrence.
Hey,
thank yeah,

445
00:26:12.881 --> 00:26:17.870
I think you got a girlfriend,
a you dating anybody who's well,
no,
maybe.
Huh?

446
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:18.701
And he goes,

447
00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:23.701
and then j reaches into his drawer and pulls out a fucking Uzi and sticks it in

448
00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:26.860
his mouth and blows his brains out.
And it,

449
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.780
it sprays out the NBC peacock on the wall because he's a company man to the

450
00:26:31.781 --> 00:26:35.230
bitter end.
And He's,
he's screaming before he puts the gun in his mouth.

451
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.500
I used to be a fucking comic.
I used to have a fun

452
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.250
and then the brain spray out the,
and Ah,

453
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.390
<v 4>I had asked him,
so I asked Jay,
I said,
what was that about man?
You know,</v>

454
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:52.230
did you guys have an argument?
Did he,
he just didn't like us.
And he goes,

455
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.250
you know,
Hick fans,
this thing,
you know,
he might,
you want to,
don't.
Uh,

456
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.920
but he wanted to do finish cramp and,
uh,
you know,

457
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:02.370
he didn't want to work for everybody.
I like to do stuff for everybody.

458
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.310
He knows and that's not what he wanted.
And like,
wow,

459
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:08.490
that's an interesting way of putting it.
But I mean,
it's true,

460
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:13.290
I guess from Jay's point of view,
but,
uh,
you know,
there was a funny bit,

461
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:16.710
sorry,
blushing.
That's fucking brilliant.

462
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.480
He goes,
he takes out the clip and reloads.
It's tricky.

463
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.500
Think about it being a water fountain,
Slick,
a spraying water fountain,
a blood.

464
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.370
Oh,
that's where my bottom,
I hit my

465
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.790
<v 2>bottom and Bosch pretty much where I used to.</v>

466
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.900
I mean I stuck in comedy,

467
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:44.540
but somehow I got work in Boston and my dream was Nick's.

468
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:50.180
I mean,
I get one nighters,
I and I fucking buy coke from the coke deal.

469
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.083
FDR who

470
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.020
he was and stay at the,

471
00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.880
at the Milner hotel behind the comedy canet where hookers and drug yet.

472
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.920
And so I'm working,

473
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.990
I'm doing a bunch of one nighters,
uh,

474
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.250

477
00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:17.560

478
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.940
<v 2>I said,
I'm coming up here for six days.
I'm not doing any drugs.
Right?</v>

479
00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.770
So I did like four or five days.
I had money,
you know,

480
00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:29.560
for me back then I probably had three or 400 bucks,

481
00:28:29.561 --> 00:28:32.800
which was a lot of fucking money or 500 bucks,
you know,

482
00:28:32.801 --> 00:28:37.801
this is so then I do an a one night or and worst store at plums someplace called

483
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:43.390
plums in Worcester,
mass.
And the waitress after the show,

484
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:48.300
I was doing bits about coke on stage and she goes,
oh,
I liked those bits.
I go,

485
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.330
do you do coach?
He goes,
yeah,
I go,

He goes,

486
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.650
I'll make some calls.

487
00:28:53.651 --> 00:28:58.651
And she was fucking smoking hot so she couldn't get any coke in Boston area or

488
00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.220
wherever.
Worcester,
Worcester.
Should I say,

489
00:29:03.221 --> 00:29:04.780
I know where we can get some common me.

490
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.250
And we got in a car and we drove back to New York.
Oh my God.

491
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.660
And I went to Spanish Harlem.

492
00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.920
I bought maybe $300 worth of freebase crack.

493
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.720
We got a hotel and smoked it all night.
I fucked her all night and smoked it.

494
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.070
Just fucking,
I mean I'm smoking crack fucking her right.

495
00:29:24.071 --> 00:29:28.300
And Saturday night and we wake up and she goes,
oh,
I gotta get back.

496
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.830
I'm now 40 minutes from my house.
Oh,

497
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.060
but I still have to Sunday night to do in Boston.

498
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.990
<v 4>Oh I have to drive all the way back to Boston now.

499
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.070

I got enough.</v>

500
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.600
20 bucks may be some cigarettes were driving up.
She goes,
I got to get high.

501
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:53.260
Can we get,

So now we pull into,

502
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:58.510
we pull into fucking somewhere,
Dan Barry and buy heroin.

503
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:00.790
I think we got ripped off because it wasn't no good.

504
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.810
Then we're driving back my nose,
blood starts just pouring on my nose.

505
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:08.560
I give my shirt and I just put the shirt up and I'm bleeding from my fucking

506
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:10.960
nose.
I go to Boston,

507
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.520
I do the Sunday go home Monday and I go into Rehab on Tuesday.

508
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.130
I was fucking with my last run.

509
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.600
But the day before Rehab,

510
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:26.650
I went in Wednesday cause I called this booker and in,

511
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.580
I need a one night or tonight because I'm going to rehab tomorrow.

512
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:33.770
I want to get high one last time.
So he gave me this place,
BF patties.

513
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:38.620
I got 60 bucks,

514
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:43.420
Four vials to crack.
Smoked him to sign up.
And then I went to Rehab.
So it was,

515
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.170
it was Boston and then that Wednesday fucking rehab.

516
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:52.280

519
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.740

[inaudible] fucking gods.

522
00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:15.620
Gavin Gavin was fucking machine a monster.
I'm machine.

523
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.820
I really wish that somebody had filmed him and high rez when he was in his
prime.

524
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.180
I use it as prime.
Here's one of the best ever.
Yeah.
Well,

525
00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:26.870
the best ever Sweeney it Chandler murderer.
If you lived in that area,

526
00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:30.260
Sweeney Todd,
you had to live in that area though.
But if you lived in that area,

527
00:31:30.261 --> 00:31:33.230
he's a murderer.
Couldn't Kevin Knox murderer?

528
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.030
These were all fucking kill.
I mean,
Steven Wright works from near Kevin.

529
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:43.160
Mike Donovan Donovan's on the murderer.
Kevin Meeney used to fucking murder.

530
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.840
Okay.
Uh,
all of them.
Kenny Kenny Rogers,
we went up.

531
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.070
Fantastic comments.
Just,
just a bunch of powerhouse.
Yeah.

532
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.660
And so polished.
Those are the things you would,
you would never expect,

533
00:31:56.661 --> 00:32:00.890
guys that you never heard to be so polished.
And when Lenny,
Lenny Clarke,
yeah,

534
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.830
Lenny Clarke.
I worked for Lenny the second time I ever got paid.

535
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.620
First time I ever got paid to open for a guy named Warren Mcdonald,

536
00:32:06.621 --> 00:32:10.410
who's a great guy.
Um,
and the second time I ever got paid to open up for,

537
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.110
for Lenny in Pittsfield at Jay's in Pittsfield.
I did that kick a punch of times.

538
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.670
Yeah.
That was a fucking,

539
00:32:16.671 --> 00:32:19.880
Greg comes the first time I ever had sex with a black girl.
Really?

540
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.100
Writers on the stones Dum,
Dum,
Dum.
I didn't hate it.

541
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:29.330
No,
I think it was normal,
normal coverage,
but oh my God,
what a body shot.

542
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.350
But I was super white because I was living in Boston.

543
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.510
There was no sun and it was probably the winter.
And uh,

544
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.790
and I was a comic and she was super black.

545
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:39.920
She was really dark and I remember had sex by

546
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.300
<v 5>the television,
the light of the television.
And it was like,
you know,</v>

547
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.020
it's like,
you know,
her blackness and my way was very surreal.

548
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.070
It was very strange.

549
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:54.040
<v 2>I remember,
I remember being black is black.</v>

550
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.870
She was super hot.
She fucking her and I came so quick.
I still do.

551
00:32:58.871 --> 00:33:02.380
I can't,
I fucking,
I can't control.
I can off often.
I come quick,

552
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.490
I'm fucking horrible.
I hate myself.
So it's just fucking horrible.

553
00:33:06.491 --> 00:33:09.670
I'm checking off.
I'm so old,
I can barely get hard.

554
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.880
So now I'm jerking off and I'm coming with a sock with a semi hard Dick.

555
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.940
I have,
it's fucking,
I'm fucking up go out its moments,

556
00:33:18.941 --> 00:33:23.050
but I've definitely done and I'm fucking her and I come quick and I'm like,
oh,

557
00:33:23.051 --> 00:33:27.760
I'm shy.
She has,
don't worry,
it's not big enough anyhow.
Pretty low.

558
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.230
Right.
I mean,
don't want her to win a war.
Anyhow,

559
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.710
she was probably used to fucking mash.
Massive fucking,
you know,

560
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.780
there are some stereotypes that are true.

561
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.990
There's some double standards that are there.
They're there for a reason,

562
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.560
whatever.
But back to Boston county,
it was just,

563
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:47.650
we used to stay at this girl Barbara Swanson's house when we'd go up there,

564
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.780
there's some crazy broad,
she passed away,
had squirrels in our house,

565
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.650
pets and fucking just all kinds of shit running around.
And uh,

566
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:57.880
Jimmy Celeste,

567
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.010
<v 5>one of the things about the east coast,</v>

568
00:34:00.011 --> 00:34:03.940
about Boston and about a New York was that there was a lot of places where you

569
00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:07.180
could work is one of the few places where you could be a pro comic and you could

570
00:34:07.181 --> 00:34:11.020
stay in that area and you could make a good living.
Yeah.
Long Island,
Connecticut,

571
00:34:11.021 --> 00:34:12.760
Connecticut was a lot.
John Schuller.

572
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.990
<v 2>Yeah,
his gigs.
Are you kidding me?
I function price.
He didn't manage me.</v>

573
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.240
Brown and Thompson.
I did New Year's Eve there.
Very

574
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.720
<v 5>Gig.
John Schiller.
He,
he helped me pay my rent and many,
many,</v>

575
00:34:22.721 --> 00:34:26.380
many a year are many,
uh,
um,
a week rather.
I did all of them.

576
00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:31.381
Block showed carry Stanley fucking Shuler cakes for six,

577
00:34:32.051 --> 00:34:34.930
seven years,
maybe all the early parts.

578
00:34:34.931 --> 00:34:37.180
Like when I first started getting paid from then on.

579
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.200
Did you move from Boston to New York or did you go back and forth?
No,

580
00:34:41.201 --> 00:34:44.380
I moved from,
I tried to keep my apartment and uh,

581
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.580
in New York when I came out to la.
But as far as like,
I've never been a,

582
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.870
I never had two places at the same time.
I just abandoned on my shit.

583
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.700
But when you came to la,
did you already have offers for shit already had a show.

584
00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.990
He rang me.
I came out to do that Fox show,
it's called hardballs a baseball show.

585
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.390
I was in 94.
And um,

586
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.570
when that show got canceled then I got news radio right after that.

587
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.200
But I came out for that.
I was even gonna leave la and go back to New York.

588
00:35:11.201 --> 00:35:15.400
I was miserable.
I just had a real hard time dealing with actors.

589
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.340
You are miserable in La.
He miserable first moved here.

590
00:35:18.341 --> 00:35:21.280
I was so used to the New York comedy scene.

591
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.760
I was so used to comics and having fun all the time.

592
00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:28.090
Like when we would work together,
if you and I were booked,
you know,

593
00:35:28.091 --> 00:35:31.060
we're going to governors or something like that.
I'm like,
oh,
we're working.

594
00:35:31.061 --> 00:35:34.000
I'm working with Voss.
We're gonna have some fun.
We'd go there,
we'd laugh,

595
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:37.860
we'd talk some shit and be great.
When you work with actors,

596
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.000
<v 4>this great actors out there,
a lot of them are really nice people,</v>

597
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:46.110
but the vast majority of them are empty,

598
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.040
vacuous Weirdos.
They're strange people.

599
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.270
It's a weird position to want to be like a pretender for living.

600
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:58.330
Constantly trying to get past and auditions.
You shed.
And I just had a,

601
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.870
I mean I met a lot of great guys like my friend Mike Star,

602
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:03.060
still still good buddy.
I love that guy.

603
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.970
I met a lot of really nice guys when I did my first show,

604
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:10.920
but I met a lot of fucking dummies man.
Fucking Bonnie has now.

605
00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:14.010
I think there's some great actors,
like I'll watch,
you know,

606
00:36:14.011 --> 00:36:15.900
I'll watch even like not even,

607
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:19.500
I need to me like a Morgan Freeman as good in everything.

608
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:22.830
He does everything,
you know,
uh,
you know,

609
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.390
and they're shutting the actors or actresses that are just fun.
But,

610
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:28.140
but comedy,

611
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.020
and this is Bonnie Sterian how much harder it is an acting.
And she says,

612
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.030
because kids and animals can act,

613
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.710
can't do comedy.

614
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.840
So true.
It's how much,
how hard comedy is and fucking acting.
Yeah,

615
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:51.960
it's ridiculous.
It's,
you can either do it or you can't do it.

616
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:55.050
That's the other thing about it.
I'm not a good,
I mean,
I'm okay.
People Go,

617
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:56.850
you can't act.
I go while I'm a fucking comic.

618
00:36:56.851 --> 00:37:00.330
You don't ask a fucking brain surgeon to do root canal.
Hey,

619
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.930
can you fucking fix this,
this molar?
No.

620
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.810
But if you have a tumor on your head,
come,
she ain't,
you know what I mean?

621
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.640
I could play myself,
you know,
or whatever,
but fuck,
fuck.

622
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.760
I could remember lines.
It's amazing when I'm watching him go,

623
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.270
how they remember all those fucking lines.
That's fucking insane.

624
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:22.200
How did you even dare fucking doing like,
you know what I mean?

625
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.120
Especially if you're doing a play,
I'm fine.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's remarkable.

626
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.730
It's just a lot of work.
It's just put it to them.
It's nothing.
And,

627
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.380
and again,
there's comics are there,
I mean there's,

628
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.260
there's comics out there that are annoying and there's actors out there that are

629
00:37:37.261 --> 00:37:38.880
great.
You're going to have both.

630
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.930
But I just missed that sort of type of sensibility.
Like the,

631
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.530
the comics,
when you,
when you're hanging out with comics,

632
00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:49.740
you're always goofing off.
You're always having fun.
There's always like,

633
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:50.940
everyone's laughing at shit.

634
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.010
No one's no one is letting anybody get away with anything.
Like,
you know,

635
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.420
I remember who the fuck was it where somebody showed up with a hat on?

636
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.200
I think it was Brian Cowen showed,
oh that's what it was.

637
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:05.580
Brian Keller friend Jimmy Burke.

638
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.210
Brian Cowen showed up with a hat on like some sort of like a fedora and he's

639
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:13.680
like,
get that fucking stupid thing off your head.
Like what are you doing?

640
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.410
Like what did you think you are doing?
And Brian's like,

641
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:19.850
thank God he did that because what if I started wearing that day we were,

642
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.660
we went to shell.
She,

643
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.900
that's the whole fucking thing about New York and tough crowd in all.

644
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.990
And this was,
we were there way before this,

645
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:32.670
but you know the whole comedy cellar and the fucking Schmidt Kiss,

646
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.980
I don't know,
maybe six months ago,
eight months ago,
Peters walks

647
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.880
<v 2>in in Russell's a pretty big act.
It's a big fucking new jack.</v>

648
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.910
He comes in with his entourage and he's wearing a double breasted fucking pea

649
00:38:46.441 --> 00:38:48.580
coat,
but it's waist high.

650
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.170
And the second we saw it,
Keith,

651
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.920
we couldn't stop fucking smashing him.
Right.

652
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.460
And Rosa,
Bonnie,
Bonnie said,
you look like the little boy on boardwalk empire,

653
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.570
which fucking,
I fell out of my seat.
Right Keith.

654
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.970
I mean,
we're fighting these fucking,
who's her?

655
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.480
His crew.
His crew couldn't laugh cause they could get fired.

656
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.810
They were like,
but we fucking,

657
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:26.260
it just cause she at the court and the table to sell on the back.

658
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.650
It's fucking sharks and you know,
even back in,
you know,

659
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.580
so next time he came in,
he's a little more fucking ready.
You know,

660
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:35.590
Russell's like he started slamming,
you know,

661
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.440
cause that's how he's not that type of comic.
And,
and I used,

662
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.770
I fight with money all the time.
Goes well,
everybody's not later.

663
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.591
Well fuck it then.

664
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:44.740
Don't come to that table because that's what's going to happen if you come to

665
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:45.970
that table.
I've come to,

666
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.240
I came to that table and I had a little pimple on my lip.

667
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.840
Fucking Kevin Hart.
Fucking poetry's Keith.
No,

668
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.060
they all started yelling for us.
Has her,

669
00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:00.400
you're yelling it and singing it in the fucking dark.

670
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:04.650
Everybody was just a little bump,
you know,
so,
but,

671
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.460
but we would sit up there all night.
It would be me,
Norton,

672
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:12.610
mainly Keith and Patrice.
Just Smith.
Billy Bird,

673
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.350
fucking Billy comes into the cellar,
right?
And he says,

674
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.490
I'm going to the world series.

675
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:22.040
It's when the mets were playing the Yankees in the world series.
I saw Mike.

676
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.020
He goes,
I'm going to the game.
We go,
how the fuck,
how do you get tickets?
He goes,

677
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:26.141
well,

678
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:31.030
these dudes hired me to do a show on their bus on the way and are given and

679
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:35.410
right when he said that,
everybody's eyes lit up.
We're fucking,

680
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:40.780
we were,
we were.
We just delete this.
You guys were good crowd

681
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.170
and off the bus.
We beat him to sweat was pouring down Billy's head.

682
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:49.330
He didn't do it.
He gave the giggle away.

683
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.760
He didn't do the again because we beat up.
They're so hard.

684
00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.730
So I mean it just fucking animals.
Eddie,

685
00:41:00.731 --> 00:41:05.731
if came in there and he started talking to me and being arrogant,

686
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:10.990
he's gone.
Uh,
how much did you make or what do you do with this?

687
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.250
And I go,
well,
I don't know.
I made it.
He goes,
why me and Patrice?

688
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:19.850
Like he was Patricia.
Tell him.
He goes,
first of all,
he called him Eddie,
right?

689
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.200
Patrice,
Patrice,

690
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:29.130
you do colleges p you Versiti or something or you stink.

691
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:33.500
I don't know what he,
but he beat up Eddie if verbally for 40.

692
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:37.820
No one else jumped in.
It was such a beating.
It was such a bt.

693
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.760
I was driving home.
I had a cold,
nor did I go.

694
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:45.910
I can't stop laughing so that you don't get that in La and the cushion like in

695
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:49.270
new,
you can go to New York.
You fucking like you said,

696
00:41:49.271 --> 00:41:54.271
you walk in when the wrong fucking hat or just your fucking shirt is too tight

697
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:58.840
or any imperfection.
Correct.

698
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.930
They're coming out to la.
They're like,
oh,
so what do you got?
What's going on?

699
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.620
Go Fuck Yourself.
Not Tell you what's not going on that fucking hair too.

700
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.610
That's,
that's the,
that's not going on.
Okay.

701
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.060
You fucking look like a Roman nickel.
Go Fuck Yourself.

702
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.540
But you can't do that here.
Well you can at the store.

703
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.090
<v 1>They even have that,
that,
that comic battle every Tuesday night at midnight.</v>

704
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:24.720
That's so packed.
You can't,
you can't even,

705
00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:28.550
people are hanging from stairways just to hear it.
It's so packed.

706
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:30.950
And that's just two comics battling each other.
Gotcha.

707
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.150
<v 2>Your stores maybe a row real renaissance.
Yeah.
To come back.
Yeah.</v>

708
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.320
That cosmic battle was every night at the shelter at a table.

709
00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.160
It's true and it was,
but it kept you on your fucking toes.

710
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.880
Dug Kevin Hall and Kevin was moving from New York to La.

711
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.170
We had a little thing at Boston comedy club,
right.
And he's on his,

712
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.560
he goes on stage to like say goodbye me,

713
00:42:53.561 --> 00:42:57.550
Patricia and Keith and it was like 20 phone books in the back for summary.

714
00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.380
We were thrown phonebooks books.
Adam,

715
00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.290
as he's saying goodbye and all your solar's phone books,

716
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:07.291
he did cross the room at fucking dumb Kevin Hart who's making 20 fucking million

717
00:43:07.361 --> 00:43:09.190
a movie,
little fucking news.

718
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.930
So it just makes you,
it makes you a better,

719
00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.870
stronger stand fucking standup because you hang it,

720
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.250
you're hanging with strong fucking standups and you also recognize the holes in

721
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:24.960
your game.
Get exposed.
You know,

722
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.960
not everybody can do that.
No.
You know,
and and I,

723
00:43:27.961 --> 00:43:31.690
and I would fight with fucking her.
Bonnie,
call me now.
Let me try.
Hello.

724
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.300
Are you seriously taking a phone call while we're in the middle?
Got to go.

725
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:38.580
I'm talking about,
I'm on Rogan's podcast.
Hi Bonnie.
Oh,

726
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:42.800
can hear that.
You just said,
why are you answering your phone then?
You do try it.

727
00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.270
<v 1>Funnies.
I shut that off.
Why would you think it's an emergency?
I'll be,</v>

728
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.560
because she's driving home.
It's got damn podcast shut.
That thing.
Sorry.

729
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.620
Are you very clingy,
rich,
like you and Bonnie?
Like are you,

730
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.190
let me explain something to you.
Don't ever fuck you've been doing this 10 years.

731
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:03.420
Luckily have a surprise show tonight.
Okay.
No,

732
00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:08.170
it just surprises you have a show that's a surprise.
Uh,
I know I'm not clingy.

733
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.960
She,
I'm only kind,
I don't mean to disrespect you and in your home,
uh,
is there,

734
00:44:12.961 --> 00:44:17.010
has there ever been anything that people have said to you that had stung enough

735
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:18.540
where you overthink it?
It like,

736
00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.150
like when you're doing these battles and you're getting riffed on like,

737
00:44:21.151 --> 00:44:23.100
like I remember like long time ago people were saying like,

738
00:44:23.101 --> 00:44:26.250
your ears smelled and like,
does that get to you?
Like,
oh shit,
my ears smell,

739
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:27.910
smell.

740
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.940
<v 2>No.
The only time I had,
I had,
I had an all out.</v>

741
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.060
It got pretty ugly with,
uh,
a bigger Leon Ona.

742
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:42.000
He came,
he was doing the virus tour one show.

743
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.890
Yeah.
And we squashed this,
but it's on you.
We squashed it,

744
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:48.750
but he didn't have the best set at deal.

745
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.810
And I was hosting those shows and that don't,
and enslaves me.

746
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.080
So he went on and he goes,
what do you want me to be like,

747
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:56.430
philosophy and work the crowd.

748
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.450
So he started going out to the crowd and it didn't go well.

749
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.900
So a widget,
it's not all his fault too.

750
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.790
They put them up towards the end of the show,
you know,

751
00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:10.290
the show is going for fucking hours,
you know,
it wasn't all,
you know,

752
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:14.490
he should've had a better spot,
you know?
Yeah.
So I mean,

753
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:18.090
they're not fucking a fucking animals.
They're mutants.
Okay.

754
00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.530
You're fucking their basement to weller mutants.
Okay.
Uh,

755
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.690
so he,
but then he came into ona and he,

756
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.770
and it's,
you know,

757
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.900
I've been doing this show for fucking years and he started making fun of how I

758
00:45:31.901 --> 00:45:35.610
talk and made some joke and he was being really arrogant and this and that.

759
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:39.840
And I go,
uh,
you know,
and I started and I'm,
I go,
let me make you feel in blue.

760
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:43.740
And then it just got worse and worse and it got really ugly.

761
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:48.960
But he was so passive aggressive about his fucking swarmy type of fucking humor

762
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.890
but don't come.
That's like when I just fucking trash chute,

763
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.490
which I shouldn't have because he says you're a fucking deal.
You know,

764
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.140
this is your deal.
You know,
I'm only kidding,
you know,
a little bit.

765
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:03.090
And so,
and uh,
but no,

766
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:07.440
there's nothing that,
you know,
we come from,
you know,
the radio I do when I do,

767
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.680
they're all fucking animals.
I know.
And a,
everything's a fucking,

768
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.480
you say something wrong or do this or that you're done.
You know.
Uh,

769
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.110
<v 5>I heard the first day back when he sat and,
uh,
Anthony,</v>

770
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.760
Chrissy,
he says,
it's fuck come.
I never really liked him anyway.

771
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.180
Let's get this audition started.

772
00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.690
I go answer Anthony's chairs in fucking long island on.

773
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.290
But you know,
and no,
just sometimes fun.
That's what people don't understand.

774
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:40.530
Like it's,
it's great to be in that company.
It's good times.

775
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.280
People are so sensitive about goofing on each other.

776
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.700
People are so sensitive about people cracking jokes.

777
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:51.660
But if someone cracks a joke about something that you're doing,
most likely,

778
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:55.020
the reason why it's things is that,
you know,
they're right and you don't want to,

779
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:57.030
you don't want to admit that you're doing something goofy.

780
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:58.140
So you get all butthurt.

781
00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.710
<v 2>The only thing that gets me sometimes is dope.
When I slur.
And if someone,</v>

782
00:47:02.711 --> 00:47:03.544
you know,
may,

783
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:08.640
like the people on Twitter think they're my friends,
they think they are.

784
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:13.240
So they try,
they,
you know,
they're not,
you're not normal.
You're not Bobby,

785
00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:18.400
you're not Billy,
you're not common.
They're insulting you.
And I go,
look,

786
00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.860
you know,
there's,
I think there's a,
uh,
a Twitter handle blocked by Voss.
Uh,

787
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:30.070
I can block these cocksuckers all the time because they,

788
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.330
<v 4>you know,
stop trying to get you to talk about and which you are,
you,</v>

789
00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.290
they're not nicknames blocked my boss.
So

790
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:46.420
that's true.
But they got you.
They got me.
So yeah,
there's not much,

791
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:50.230
I mean,
cause I'm a,
I'm a creep.
I fucking differences.
You're funny.
You know,

792
00:47:50.231 --> 00:47:52.720
and some people do it and they don't know that they're not being funny.

793
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.860
They just,
some people that,
oh,

794
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:56.350
you can't take a joke when they're just being there,
just being shitty.

795
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.070
They're just being like a rude person.
Well,
it's not a joke and be funny,

796
00:48:00.071 --> 00:48:04.580
you know,
it's just,
I don't know.
I mean,
cause you can't take a joke rich.
I mean,

797
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.160
I married one and a mean as female comics on the planet.
She just fucking mean.

798
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:12.820
That's why we,
you know,
we fight nonstop,

799
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:17.821
but we come together when we find a victim that we both want to attack.

800
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.540
When there's somebody that we both can go after at the same time,

801
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:27.350
that's where our love really comes out for each other.
That's where you,

802
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.850
you know,
because like when our manager will call and say something stupid,

803
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:34.780
we'll just start fucking attacking them together.
Even when he hangs up with,

804
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:38.260
just keep it attacking until done.
And,
and,
and,

805
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:43.090
and near Sar love the one that,
you know,
through combat.

806
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.650
I know bad cop and bad cop.
It's just when we come in,

807
00:48:47.651 --> 00:48:49.300
people just,
Oh,
here they come.

808
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:55.750
And,
uh,
I just stuff all,
you're right.

809
00:48:55.751 --> 00:48:59.230
The whole New York thing is so much,
it wasn't like that when I came out here.

810
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.890
When I came out here in 94 the comedy scene was very different at the store.

811
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.940
The store especially was a,
it was really barren.
It was weird.
I came,

812
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.560
I arrived and a real downtime there was like a real low,

813
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.680
it's like the,
the level of comics that you'd see there on the weekend.

814
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:16.750
It was very low.
It was weird.

815
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.340
It was like there was a lot of like a lot of bad comedy going on and then Martin

816
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.000
Lawrence search showing up and then Damon started showing up more and then you

817
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:28.090
start seeing like some big names that were coming there more and more and more.

818
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:28.421
And then I was,

819
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:33.421
I was coming up from the store in the mid nineties it started picking up again.

820
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.530
But when I came at night and my first came in [inaudible] 94 man,

821
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:39.700
it was a real low,
it was so disappointing because I was used to New York.

822
00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:44.380
I was used to doing sets,
a danger fields.
I was used to doing the comic strip.

823
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.410
I was used to doing all these clubs and see all these great comics and all this

824
00:49:47.411 --> 00:49:51.250
great energy and then every,
you know,
everybody fun having,
you know,

825
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.700
enjoying running into your friends and laughing a lot,
poking fun at Shit.

826
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.520
And then all of a sudden I was at this weird barren wasteland where everybody

827
00:49:57.521 --> 00:50:00.460
was working to get a fucking development deal.
Everyone was like,

828
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.480
they all had these big fucking play dies and they were running around trying to

829
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:08.110
get a seven minute set together so they can get on the tonight show or get to a

830
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.840
MTV half hour comedy hour spots so they could,
you know,

831
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.510
get some sort of a development deal at a,
at a festival.

832
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.690
Was it completely different scene?
Yeah,
but we'll true like you said before,

833
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:21.010
there was no money to be made out here unless you did those things like back

834
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:21.311
there though,

835
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:25.360
which one night there was tons of weekend rooms back on the east coast.

836
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:30.550
A comic could like you like in La back then say on a weekend you did what?

837
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:34.160
The improv and a story when you do 15 minutes or whatever.

838
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.870
But back in New York,
you could go out to long island due east side.

839
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:43.820
Governors are chuckles if your headline and do 45 to an hour make money.

840
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:46.640
So now you're becoming a strong fucking comic.

841
00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.570
Cause learn how to catch people's attention.
And he's Barsha.
Yes.
Yeah.

842
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:54.800
You're doing the one nighters during the week where you know some are good and

843
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:58.400
some are knife fights where you're going to go,
I'm going to win.

844
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:01.100
You know like Betty's fireside was a fucking,

845
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.070
this place was the thunder dome does it?
So many of those places.

846
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:06.920
You ever no guns.
Those gigs in Jersey last week.

847
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:14.360
Bob Gunzel.
It's fucking great room.
Yeah,
he had one on a cold last week.

848
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.780
What's the fucking one he had?
Uh Oh God that was fucking hit.

849
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:23.000
So many of them.
Yeah,
he had a bunch of them come and go.

850
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:26.630
They would come and go and there was one up on,
ah fuck.
I don't remember.

851
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.460
I just remember cause I got blown in the parking lot
on the shore.

852
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.030
I did one with auto and George and the shore.
That's what we did.

853
00:51:35.031 --> 00:51:37.010
We did the one that she signed it the shore together.

854
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.770
We did at least one together.
We might have been more than one.
What we did want,

855
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.001
were you there?

856
00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:45.800
The one where auto walked off stage where he like he was crushing.
Yes.
That yet.

857
00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:48.650
That was the one he was racist shit.

858
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.370
Oh my God.
He was fucking destroying.
He was onstage.

859
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.540
I don't want to paraphrase what he was saying.

860
00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.680
It was unbelievably racist shit know he's just dropping n bombs left and right.

861
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:05.870
I forget what the fuck it was,
but then he had like this weird look on his face,

862
00:52:05.871 --> 00:52:09.530
like he had to get off stage and he left early and I remember everybody was
like,

863
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:13.670
what the fuck?
He was killing like why did he stop?
Then it was his guy,

864
00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:18.671
Mike Austin and there was so many horrible fucking horrible and great.

865
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.170
You could work every night or great gigs and death.

866
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:26.840
I would go on the road.
She,
when I first started,

867
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.910
besides that I would go into road and host,
just go to Texas.

868
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.620
That's when I worked with Hicks.
I hosted,

869
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:38.090
I hosted for Sandy Diperna in Virginia Beach and Richmond,

870
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.530
you know,
just to get stage time,
I had to get on stage and get,
you know,

871
00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:47.300
I remember me and fucking does comic Dennis Ross.
We drove to Connecticut.

872
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:52.190
We were getting 25 bucks a piece.
This was a long fucking drive.
So we get up,

873
00:52:52.191 --> 00:52:56.870
we do our shows,
and the guy gives us 15 each.
No 10 [inaudible] we go,

874
00:52:56.871 --> 00:53:00.800
it's supposed to be 25 the guy goes,
you had the salad bar.
I go,
go fuck yourself.

875
00:53:00.801 --> 00:53:04.890
It's not $15 for a salad bar.
What are you talking about?
This salad?

876
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:08.600
Try to enjoy it.
He didn't want to give us 25 feet.
I mean,
we must have stung,

877
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:12.440
but he didn't want to give us 25 each that we drove.

878
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.520
But that's what you would do.
I mean,
comics still do it now.
You know,

879
00:53:16.521 --> 00:53:21.200
they'll do fucking laundromats.
They'll do shows,
you know,
you know,

880
00:53:21.201 --> 00:53:22.940
and Freddy's basement,

881
00:53:22.941 --> 00:53:26.520
if there's enough for some guys got a show somewhere in la in a house.

882
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.990
<v 6>Yeah,

883
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:34.950

No.
Yeah.

884
00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.720
Bunch of people.
Like I don't remember.

885
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:38.370
I don't know where the house is somewhere in la,

886
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.320
but like they have a stage set up.
You go on like,

887
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.820
like a very small stage and then all these people are sitting on the floor in

888
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:49.740
front of you.
Wow.
Wait,
wait a second.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

889
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.600
Somebody told me it was a fun gig too.

890
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:56.490
I'm doing a strip club with Duncan Trussell next month.
I like that guy,

891
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:58.770
Sam Tripoli and a few other people.
Where are you guys doing that?

892

893
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.980

I think it's the crazy girls in Hollywood.

894
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:11.510
Crazy girl.

But it was a weekend and it was like for 600 bucks or whatever.</v>

900
00:54:35.931 --> 00:54:39.950
And you're fucking those those gigs strengthen you.

901
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:44.720
Those drives home to it.
What the fuck am I doing?
I've,
I've tried,

902
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.670

<v 2>I remember doing this is,

if he stories are born,</v>

904
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.240

but I fucking,
I was on the road doing a bunch of stuff in Florida,

905
00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:02.160
so I'm down in Florida and just a bunch of horrible one nighters and all I keep

906
00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:04.100
hearing on the radio is common.

907
00:55:04.101 --> 00:55:09.101
Quintin Mario Joiner come to Miami and wash him tape that our HBO comedy

908
00:55:09.591 --> 00:55:13.010
special.
So they were down there taping their specials,
you know,

909
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:16.850
and I was doing these shitty one sorta first and I'd always had a place,

910
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:22.160
there were puppets behind the stage behind it.
It was a,
not a Chucky cheese,

911
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:24.890
but another one.
But if you want me to curtain,

912
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.850
there was puppets there in the day for the kids and I'm doing fucking puppets.

913
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:32.360
Then the next night,
right,
the next night I'm going,

914
00:55:32.361 --> 00:55:33.470
they're going to come in for pizza.

915
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.500
You have to do their specialist and see them work in a pup.
So the next night,

916
00:55:36.501 --> 00:55:40.400
I mean homestead and some fucking horrible,
horrible,

917
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.570
I'm just barely making it through half bombing.

918
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:49.810
Half these fucking inbred motherfuckers and 40 minutes is up and I'm getting

919
00:55:50.691 --> 00:55:54.320
ready to walk off.
Thank you again.
The owner walks up,
he's six foot something.

920
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.420
He holds my hand and he says,

921
00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.590
I think you were very rude to the comic.
Uh,

922
00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:05.250
he came all the way down here and I want you to be nicer.

923
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.740
He'll do another 20 minutes.

924
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.263
<v 6>Ah,</v>

925
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:13.760
<v 2>fucking what?
So then I'm driving technologies.</v>

926
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.570
Just do 20 minutes.
I just something maybe 10 of this and I drove,

927
00:56:17.571 --> 00:56:21.050
I was driving to key Biscayne to do my last night,
I swear.

928
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.220
And then on the radio and I have two kids.

929
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:29.080
I miss them a homeward bound by Simon and Garfunkel comes on and just like

930
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:32.470
tears.
I'm crying as I'm driving to the gate,
you know,

931
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.810
I wish I was homeward bound and you know,

932
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.830
each town looks ashamed to me and I'm fucking all these shitty one nighters and

933
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:43.831
I'm crying and I get to the fucking last gig and I swear to God I'm on stage.

934
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.020
I just finished crying in my car,
which I've cried at a lot of them.

935
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:52.080
And this girl walks by in hot pants and she checked on me and she has a wooden

936
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.130
fucking leg in hot pants.

937
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:58.990
You don't fucking wear hot pants where we could see what a leg attaches to the

938
00:56:58.991 --> 00:57:03.310
fucking nasty fucking.
And I just fucking bitch,

939
00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:07.150
I'll beat you with your leg.
Go leave me the fuck alone.
And I just,
you know,

940
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:11.440
and I drove and I got home and I,
it was just a lot.

941
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:15.670
I drove there to Florida and just horrible one nighters.
I had kids,

942
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:18.260
I had to make money,
I had to make fucking match.

943
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:22.120
When I started doing the black circuit,
I started doing urban clubs.

944
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.670
You did def jam?
Yeah,
I was the first white comics.

945
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:29.290
You do def jam and went on for five years and they go and I was doing the black

946
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:34.090
clubs and the next year if they w they were supposed to stop,

947
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.500
I would have been the only white guy.

948
00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:37.750
But then they did it the next year and they had a couple more.

949
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:42.880
But I was doing the black clubs too.
I had to earn fucking money.

950
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:46.710
I had two kids,
a house,
you know,
and you know,

951
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:51.310
I didn't have TV credits then.
So you would just do fucking,

952
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:56.310
you know,
I was doing fucking clubs in the Bronx and in fucking Harlem and,
and,

953
00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.570
and Newark that,
you know,
black comics were scared to go in.
Okay.
Will,

954
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:03.470
I'm not bullshitting,
you know,

955
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.790
peppermint lounge just club was fucking brutal.

956
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:11.720
<v 5>You champagne comedy club in Mount Vernon?
No.
Was it in Malvern?</v>

957
00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:15.600
Newest Shell might've been new shell.
There was a place in new Rochelle.

958
00:58:15.601 --> 00:58:18.740
There's a black club called the champagne comedy club.
Fuck it.

959
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:23.430
You had to keep it clean.
Uh,
I could never do it.
I keep it clean.
Yeah,

960
00:58:23.431 --> 00:58:26.550
it was one of,
um,
my friend Jon Tobin went in there,

961
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:30.210
John John Doe radio before John was on the radio.

962
00:58:30.211 --> 00:58:33.180
John was a comic and uh,
he was,
um,

963
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:36.000
he was on set and that's where I first saw Reggie McFadden.

964
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:38.790
I think I might've seen him once before and it's short set.

965
00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:43.540
But that was when the first time I ever saw Reggie McFadden.
[inaudible]
yeah.

966
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.680
I was like,
Holy Shit,
that guy's talented.
I was,
I was blown away.

967
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:50.400
I couldn't believe how funny I thought that guy was the next any Murphy.

968
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:54.300
I'm like,
I'm watching the hawks gigantic superstar for sure.
I was like,

969
00:58:54.301 --> 00:58:56.550
this is no way this kid is so much fucking talent.

970
00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.580
But the guy had like all these rules,
like he couldn't say.

971
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.700
He like he would say before the show,
no motherfuckers,

972
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:06.780
I don't even know mother fuckers.
He goes,
you don't say ass.

973
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.340
You don't say that bitch had a big ass.

974
00:59:08.341 --> 00:59:12.390
You say that woman that had a wide behind,
she had like rules.

975
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:14.370
He would tell you how to do your comedy.

976
00:59:14.371 --> 00:59:18.300
This is the champagne comedy club hamburger.
I want to say Mount Vernon,

977
00:59:18.301 --> 00:59:20.910
but it might've been new Rochelle,
I'm not sure,
but it was in that area.

978
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.973
I did one,

979
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.260
<v 2>I did one terminal date and I was hosting the show.
And this,
I'll tell you,</v>

980
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:30.430
two of them I was hosting,
I'll tell you to go all the,

981
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.630
fuck that one I was doing fuck down.
I was working,
there was a,
uh,

982
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.780
Justin's a one night or New York and I get on,

983
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.410
I'm onstage and it's going well.
And then I start fucking bombing.

984
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.780
I mean,
and like in a black audience will love you or they'll turn on you just,

985
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.900
I mean,
there's no way do I need,
it's just,
we'll give you some lead way,

986
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:57.070
but wait on.
And he says,
you know,
you're,
you,

987
00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:01.070
you can become a delusional conic would white audiences because you think you're

988
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:01.550
good.

989
01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:04.580
It's just that they're not as outgoing as black audiences that will let you know

990
01:00:04.581 --> 01:00:07.220
you're not good.
You know?
So I started,

991
01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:11.960
I was really bombing and someone in tobacco gave me the siren,
you know,

992
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:15.620
the,
from the showtime at the Apollo when earn.

993
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.660
So I heard the time and I go,
fuck you.
You don't know what the Fuck I've done.

994
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.860
I snapped.
I go,
uh,
you know I've been on this show that show this show.

995
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:28.550
I got a 15 years sober.
I've been on HBO.

996
01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:31.850
I had done this stat.
I go,
what have you accomplished?

997
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:36.230
And the whole place went fucking silent.
I walked off and it was puffy.

998
01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:40.640
That was given.
It was his club.
It was bumpy.
That was giving me the siren.

999
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:45.820
What have you accomplished?
God so lit.
Puffy before he was p did it?

1000
01:00:45.821 --> 01:00:50.180
Yeah.
It was puffy at the time.
Which his place.
That is fucking funny.

1001
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:55.370
Boy.
You wrong.
Yes.

1002
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.150
Yes.
It's just there are so many.
When I taped def jam,

1003
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.500
I did a bit from this,
but when I taped def jam,

1004
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.280
I went to one of the tapings just to watch tonight before so guide Tori was to

1005
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:14.420
warm up and he came out.
He said,
look,
this is not the Apollo.

1006
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.180
We do not boo here.
This is HBO.

1007
01:01:17.181 --> 01:01:21.590
We don't fool with respect to comics and let's have a good show.

1008
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.790
I ran into him the other night.
He's a nice,
nice,
just kind of great guy.

1009
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.633
Fucking clothes guy.

1010
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.840
I don't know Joe like actually rented a Joe recently,

1011
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:34.610
but guy used to do um,
fat Tuesday at the store.
She guy all the time guys.

1012
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:37.580
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
And Joe's cool to,

1013
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.410
Joe was like one of the first really yolked up comics till you go on stage with

1014
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:47.390
like a vest on giant arms.
He was,
yeah,
he was fucking guy was huge.
Posse.

1015
01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:50.960
It was fucking,
he was fucking,
he was uh,
he was jacked.

1016
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.790
Angel Angel Salazar was the first pumped after he got fucking smacked around.

1017
01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:59.780
So he pumped up a little,
but he got smacked around.
Yeah.
To store two years ago.

1018
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:02.270
What happened?
I think Kennison smacked him around.

1019
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.710
Tennyson beat up angel sounds a story.
I don't know it,

1020
01:02:05.711 --> 01:02:08.630
so I don't want to tell it.
I don't cause I don't know the whole story.

1021
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.460
That's funny.
So I go watch his conduct on depth champ.

1022
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.610
I go watch the taping and no booing.

1023
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.490
So there's black comic comes out,
this is in New York.

1024
01:02:20.491 --> 01:02:24.420
And the first thing he says,
I want to show it off by saying,
first of all,

1025
01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:27.570
I'm not from New York.
I'm from Canada.
Strike one.

1026
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.340
Then he had an old gold suit on.

1027
01:02:31.341 --> 01:02:35.870
He looked like a century 21 salesman strike two and then the next joke he

1028
01:02:35.871 --> 01:02:38.960
bombed.
So when a black audience cam,
Ooh,
you,

1029
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:41.630
all you heard through the ordinance was,
hmm

1030
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.133
<v 5>mm</v>

1031
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:49.970
<v 2>child.
And so they would let you know.</v>

1032
01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:53.930
But if they,
if a black audience liked you,
they fucking loved you.

1033
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.590
I mean you would fucking kill.
I did it.

1034
01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.380
<v 5>Black Casino,
same thing.
[inaudible] the whole time.</v>

1035
01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:04.770
Is there a nicer guy than guide toward,
is there a nicer guy?
He was,
he was,

1036
01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:08.770
might be like the nicest guy ever.
He's just,
every time I shave him he's just,

1037
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.820
he's just a sweetheart.
Yeah,
it was a good guy.
Funny fucking dude too,
man.

1038
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:16.520
He's what needs,
he's been a lot of movies.
He does a lot of radio too.
Doesn't,

1039
01:03:16.521 --> 01:03:17.440
he didn't used to do,

1040
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.650
he used to do a radio show out of La and it was like in Atlanta or something

1041
01:03:20.651 --> 01:03:23.620
like that.
And you'd get up early in La,
do his radio show.

1042
01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:27.850
What was he on that guy from?
He was unjoin a shell.
I think he had his own show.

1043
01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:30.340
I think he had like a syndicated show for awhile.
I don't know.

1044
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.670
Every time I see him it's a pleasure to see them.
Yeah.
Like I said,

1045
01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:38.390
him and his brother,
they're both cool as fuck.
Uh,
funny dudes,
man.

1046
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:43.270
Funny dudes.
The the Lac and has got a lot better than it was in 94.
But uh,

1047
01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.090
the New York scene has always been like a little edgier.

1048
01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.270
I wonder if it's like just the cold weather,
you know,

1049
01:03:49.271 --> 01:03:52.300
just the fucking bitterness of the winters in New York.

1050
01:03:52.301 --> 01:03:55.240
I wonder what it is that just speed of life.
Yeah.
It's also,

1051
01:03:55.241 --> 01:03:59.470
there's so many more fucking people like on top of each other in some weird way.

1052
01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:02.970
Well,
they don't have to interact with each other the same way in la.
Yeah.

1053
01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:06.970
You're never wins in their car.
They go to a house for the most part,

1054
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.440
the ice house and the Improv and the laugh factory and the comedy store.

1055
01:04:10.441 --> 01:04:12.160
We're all like in the same street,
you know?

1056
01:04:12.161 --> 01:04:16.330
And then there was another street next to or all.
How about in La itself?

1057
01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:19.660
Like if just like Hollywood,
like you think about how many,

1058
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:22.780
how many comedy clubs are actually in Hollywood?
There's quite a few,

1059
01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:25.960
but nothing compared to New York.
New York's got like a hundred clubs.

1060
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:30.940
There's clubs literally might be a hundred comedy clubs in New York City.

1061
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:34.200
There might be,
there's some,
I mean alternative or,
Oh yeah.

1062
01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:36.830
If you start counting in Brooklyn and oh by the way,
Ari,
you should.

1063
01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:41.760
Fear is going to be at the Bell House in Brooklyn Tomorrow night.
If you're in a,

1064
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:42.760
if you're in Brooklyn,

1065
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:47.440
he's preparing his new comedy special that he's going to record.

1066
01:04:47.441 --> 01:04:52.441
That's October 29th in La at the comedy store in the original group.

1067
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:55.610
That sets a bad ass crazy place.

1068
01:04:55.630 --> 01:05:00.430
And Ari has a new podcast and I'm telling you,
man,
I don't break up too easy,

1069
01:05:00.431 --> 01:05:05.260
but I was crying listening to this.
He has a new podcast.
It's um,

1070
01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.550
it's Jonah Ray.
I think it's number one 80.
And Jonah raises guest.

1071
01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.820
But along the way during the beginning of the podcast is all him talking about

1072
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.090
his journey from an open microphone

1073
01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:22.960
<v 0>is first time on stage to finally getting passed at the comedy store after four</v>

1074
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:26.770
fucking years of constant auditions to him,

1075
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:30.550
eventually getting a comedy central special and is going to record it,

1076
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.630
film it at the comedy store in the original room and he's crying when he's

1077
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:36.190
saying this.
It's incredible.

1078
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:40.300
It's one of the most motivational and inspirational things I've ever heard.

1079
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:42.210
A comic too fucking incredible.

1080
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.930
Is there something in particular that that makes it sad?
Like dizzy,

1081
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.070
sad.
He's emotional,
he's happy,
you know,
it just means so much to him.
You know,

1082
01:05:51.071 --> 01:05:52.940
he's just talking like I'm breaking up,
talking about,

1083
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.730
he was just talking about how,
um,
how much it meant to him and um,

1084
01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.800
how,
how hard he worked for it.
And he just,
you know,
he kept saying it like,
it's,

1085
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.730
it's my home.
It was really intense,
man.
Like I'm seriously breaking up.

1086
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.750
I'm talking about it.
It's really intense.
It's a,

1087
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:12.450
you got to listen to it because you know,
and he's,

1088
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:16.270
he's super honest with himself,
super honest about the whole thing.
It's pretty,

1089
01:06:16.271 --> 01:06:20.290
pretty amazing.
That's pretty amazing stuff.
So that's October 29th,
and then he's,

1090
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.720
like I said,
he's at the,
um,

1091
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:25.960
at the Bell House tomorrow in Brooklyn today being what?
What's Today's date?

1092
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.450
The 19th 20th.
Today's the 20th.
The Bell House in Brooklyn.

1093
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.630
The 21st of August,
2014 go fuck yourself.
Uh,

1094
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:41.650
I like him.
He's awesome.
He's awesome.
He,

1095
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:46.700
he's most improved player of the decade award.
Motherfucker.
He works hard there.

1096
01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:51.310
Guy Puts in work.
Art should.
Fear is a discipline man.
He gets shit done.

1097
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:56.290
I respect the fuck out of that.
The guy writes,
he writes a lot.
So important man.

1098
01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.360
So important.
It's just effort plus,
you know,
results,
you know,

1099
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.230
effort equals results rather.

1100
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.330
He knows if you don't see progression,
if you're not

1101
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:11.420
<v 2>fucking advantage or stagnating,
you know what I mean?</v>

1102
01:07:11.421 --> 01:07:13.880
You got to just keep reinventing.
And Dylan and Dylan,

1103
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:18.420
<v 0>she's got a right to do that.
The number one thing,
man,
this,</v>

1104
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:20.620
it's hard.
It's people get lazy,

1105
01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:21.760

1106
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:25.260

1108
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:33.690
You Know Louis C k a a 15 minutes.
We'll have another hour.

1109
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:35.371
Hold on.

Yeah it will write it in 50 hell habit at at five o'clock west coast time.

Y'All ilab another hour.

1112
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.200
<v 0>Yeah.
He's interesting when he talks about it too.
Cause Louie,
um,</v>

1113
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.400
he's got a computer you can't get on the Internet was,

1114
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:48.840
and that's what he writes on.

1115
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:53.160
So he can't like jerk off or look at new cars are fucking think about buying a

1116
01:07:53.161 --> 01:07:55.710
jet,
you know,
he just has can only right.

1117
01:07:55.970 --> 01:08:00.560
<v 2>I,
you know,
like sometimes I blame my,
uh,
failure on,</v>

1118
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:04.430
well I got kids this and that,
but Louie has kids,
he has everything that,

1119
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:08.780
you know what I mean?
And He seems to get it done,
he seems.

1120
01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.410
<v 0>Do you do a podcast by herself or only with Bonnie only.
Would Bonnie,</v>

1121
01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:16.040
you ever thought about doing one by herself as well,
since tour by yourself

1122
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.960
<v 2>sometimes.
Right.
I told him by himself all the time.</v>

1123
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.550
Why don't you do a podcast by yourself too?

1124
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:23.060
I was thinking it because we have,

1125
01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.650
do you tell these stories on your podcast with her?
No.

1126
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.530
These are great fucking story.
These stories should all be on a,

1127
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:34.310
on a podcast and I know you've got a hundred more of them.
Yeah,
I know you do.

1128
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:38.540
Fucking all you have is stories and you should have,

1129
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.280
you should have your own podcast.
I should have done,
I should try it once.

1130
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:47.180
You know,
look at you already backing down dude.
Now just do it.
Start now.
Ready.

1131
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:51.260
The rich muck podcast starts now.

1132
01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:55.160
Compound testing,
testing.
Oh Shit.
That's how I start my other one.

1133
01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.440
You know it in it.
It starts when you're fucking,

1134
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:04.550
here's the deal for a good comic.
For me,
a good comic.

1135
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:08.600
Like you'll like,
you'll see conflicts and I've said this in many interviews,

1136
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.390
you know,
and I think a good artist too or any type is somebody that works from,

1137
01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.810
from their,
from their heart.
You know what I mean?

1138
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:21.500
Like when you walk out of fucking Stan hope show,
you go,

1139
01:09:21.501 --> 01:09:26.090
I know this fucking dude.
Right?
Okay.
When you walk out a college show your show.

1140
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.150
Okay.
And that's,
don't get me wrong.
That's for me,

1141
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:34.660
that's the kind of comedy I think is what I like is fuck.

1142
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.130
Oh man,
he's telling me about what the fuck you,

1143
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.950
I talked about my house burning down,
you know,

1144
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.650
and I tried to make it funny or whatever.
Or you know,

1145
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.070
obviously we have kids in that shit,
but,

1146
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:50.150
and then there's the other comedy from here that just certain ones that are so

1147
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:54.260
fucking funny.
You Go,
well that's funny,
but then you go,

1148
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.900
or what the fuck did he,
what was he talking about?
I don't know,

1149
01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:01.040
but he was fucking funny.
That's quite look Harlan Williams.
Perfect example.
Yeah.

1150
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:04.610
Harlan's hilarious.
But yeah,
you get off the fucking,
you leave the room.

1151
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:05.870
They're like,
what the hell did he talk about?

1152
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:10.820
He talked about about her not flap Jack flapper jaw,
you know me,

1153
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:16.100
Kissy Lips,
he'll see shit.
You'll be,
you'll be howling.
But you're like,

1154
01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:19.550
what the fuck is he talking about?
I'm the one to 10 scale.

1155
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:23.780
I don't want to 10 scale.
He's at 10.
He's and is a 10 as a person too.

1156
01:10:23.781 --> 01:10:28.650
He's a great guy.
I don't know him.
Harland was breast so nice.
Uh,
well,
you know,

1157
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:31.820
we're,
we're talking about to me,
nice guys.
Let's get to the assholes.
Uh,

1158
01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:36.290
cause there's a lot.
Uh,
so,
but here's what,
to me,
what I think makes

1159
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:40.880
to me a great comic and you know,
I fucking like,

1160
01:10:40.881 --> 01:10:43.580
I've seen Stan hope a little,

1161
01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:47.570
but I've read some of his stuff and I'm going,
I can never,

1162
01:10:47.571 --> 01:10:51.500
I'll never write that good.
You know,
when he writes a fucking blog or cause,

1163
01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:55.140
you know,
and I'm going,
it's just brilliant shit.
And,

1164
01:10:55.190 --> 01:11:00.190
and what it is that makes somebody fucking great probably as a musician,

1165
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.100
as an actor,
as,

1166
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.200
as an artist is life experience and what you've been through in life.

1167
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:12.790
So if you've been through fucking drug addiction recovery to force kids,

1168
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.420
<v 4>this neighborhood,
that neighbor grown up fighting cry whenever,</v>

1169
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:22.800
you see what I'm saying?
You get some 22 year old kid that,
you know,

1170
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:28.170
the industry is fucking fallen over.
What the fuck.
You know what I mean?

1171
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:32.580
Do they really know what can they,
well,
they can't really know,

1172
01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:34.200
but they can still have talent.
I mean,

1173
01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:38.640
Chapelle was hilarious when he was 18 I first saw him and he was like 18 years

1174
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:42.000
old.
He was a what was his past before eight that's true.
That's true.
Well,

1175
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:45.270
how about Hicks?
I don't think hex had much going on in his life.
That was crazy.

1176
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.100
I mean,
I'll finish exception subject doesn't know violence,
right?
I Dunno.
I mean,

1177
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:52.500
maybe I'm wrong.
I could be wrong.
It's true.
As true.

1178
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:58.290
It's possible that someone just has an insanely good sense of humor and then

1179
01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:00.880
with life experience it gets better.
You know?

1180
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:04.140
I think that's certainly possible because I know the guys that were not good

1181
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:05.610
when they were 21 they're great now,

1182
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.210
not 35 and they're really fucking awareness 14 years,

1183
01:12:09.211 --> 01:12:10.590
but it took hundred 14 years and,

1184
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:14.970
and the things in life that happened to him at 14 years.
Any other shit,

1185
01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:18.240
of course.
And even trying to be a comic,

1186
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.440
just the devastating effects of trying to be a comic and being rejected and

1187
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:24.420
bombing build character.

1188
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:29.330
So in like inadvertently it made him a comic by sucking at being a comedy

1189
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.470
because comedy is,
look,

1190
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.230
you need a fucking audience to tell you you're good or bad.

1191
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.210
You can't sit at home and practice.
You can do certain things at home,

1192
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:41.290
you can write,
you can write stuff down,

1193
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:45.060
but then it has to grow in front of an audience.
You have to have an audience.

1194
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.700
You could,
you could sing at home for a year straight and get,

1195
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:52.890
become a better singer,
I'm sure.
Right?
I don't know about saying,
but you know,

1196
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:57.420
back like I say there,
she's Bro,
you know,
they had bringer shows back east,

1197
01:12:57.421 --> 01:13:01.950
which is the worst,
you know,
comics to get on stage have to bring fucking people,

1198
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.500
which is fucking brutal.
Cause first of all,

1199
01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:06.960
it's tough enough to do comedy now they're producers.

1200
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:11.360
So it's tough enough to bring people and be funny if I,

1201
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.520
but what's even tougher is being one of those fucking friends driving home into

1202
01:13:16.681 --> 01:13:20.280
comic going,
no,
you did well,
you know,
you and you know,

1203
01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:25.540
that's what's tough is that Fred all the way home.
Shit.

1204
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:30.390
Brutal.
Fucking brutal.
So I don't know what,
you know,
I just,

1205
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:34.350
I,
I don't know.
Maybe I'm not like,
I studied,

1206
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.290
like that's why I,
I,

1207
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.320
I really loved Bonnie because she knew comedy.

1208
01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:44.100
She fucking knew comma,
he lived Cami.
That's what,

1209
01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:47.370
this wasn't just some girl that I could be,

1210
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.590
she history and writing shit and brilliant,
you know,

1211
01:13:52.591 --> 01:13:56.150
new this one,
that one,
you know,
fucking Newhart,

1212
01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.180
woody Allen and Landesberg and all these,
you know what I mean?

1213
01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:04.170
I'm going [inaudible] to me,
she just,
you don't,

1214
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:07.930
plus she was fucking,
you know,
she was fucking hot.

1215
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.400
But you know what I mean?
And as just,
I

1216
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.600
<v 5>don't want to sound like some old fucking,
you know,
relic comic,
but you know,</v>

1217
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.500
there's some new comics should are great.
You watch them,
but do they know,

1218
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:23.140
do they,
you know,
they,
they didn't see the dean,

1219
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.240
the Dean Martin Roast or the Dean Martin Roast.
You didn't,
nope.

1220
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.800
None of them.
Nope.
He didn't want to.
You have,
you didn't see any of sorry.

1221
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.100
Oh No,
didn't,
oh,
I'm not a row sky.

1222
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:39.670
I don't like roasts facility because I like,

1223
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.800
I like when people bust on each other.
Look,

1224
01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.960
but I don't like when they do it in front of a crowd.

1225
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.590
I think like when it comics fuck around with each other in like in private,

1226
01:14:47.591 --> 01:14:49.420
it's hilarious to me.
It's so funny,

1227
01:14:49.421 --> 01:14:53.170
like seeing Pr Patrice laughing at you about something.

1228
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:54.880
It's the great moments.

1229
01:14:54.881 --> 01:14:58.990
But the difference between that and doing it in front of a crowd where people

1230
01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:03.040
get on the die,
the ds or the whatever they call the thing,
the Deus Deus,

1231
01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.740
but your notes out there and you shit on everybody.

1232
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.490
I always find that to be like so fabricated.
It just,
I don't like it.
Well,

1233
01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:12.910
ish fabric.
Yeah,
but it feel,
it feels fabricated.

1234
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:15.040
Like I understand that some people enjoy it,

1235
01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:19.000
but styles and things that people don't enjoy.
I don't enjoy that kind of comedy.

1236
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.151
Well,

1237
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:24.151
here's why Roche on is as good as the back then when because they're not

1238
01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:28.180
friends.
They don't,
exactly.
That's what I'm,
that's what my point is.

1239
01:15:28.181 --> 01:15:31.300
It just mean to each other.
Yeah.
Amy Schumer,
when she'd roasted,

1240
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:34.690
when Mike Tyson was in the crowd and she brutalized Mike Tyson.

1241
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:37.300
Did you ever see that?
I think it was a Charlie Sheen's rice roast.

1242
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.620
That was actually pretty fucking funny.
Amy Schumer destroyed Mike Tyson.

1243
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.220
Amy Schumer is a funny bitch.
She's fucking funny.

1244
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:50.200
She's fucking funny man.
That chicks,
she throws heat

1245
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:56.320
if you slip,
you know shit fucking take you out,
man.
She's funny dude.

1246
01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:59.640
But she hung up that table fuck cash table at the comedy cellar.

1247
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:04.030
That's where you know,
I don't know Jerry Seinfeld,
but it's really fascinating.

1248
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:05.410
Like Amy has like this,

1249
01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:10.530
this sort of issue with the Jerry Seinfeld's like nonacceptance of diversity and

1250
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:14.680
comedy and it's like,
I think particularly women,
like there's something about it.

1251
01:16:14.681 --> 01:16:17.900
Like when we had her on the show,
she was pretty upset,
um,

1252
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.070
about this one thing that Jerry Seinfeld did.
It was,
um,

1253
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:26.610
there was this a thing for comedians in cars getting coffee and they had gone

1254
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:28.750
over all the people that had been on the show and they were like,

1255
01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.150
everybody's a white man.
Like,
where's the fucking diversity?

1256
01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.960
And Jerry Seinfeld goes,
look,
I don't,
I don't speak diversity.
I speak funny.

1257
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.900
Are you funny?
If you're funny,
then I'm interested in what you have to say,

1258
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:40.990
but I don't care if you're black or white.
I just care about funny.

1259
01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.800
She wasn't hearing it,
she wasn't buying it,
and she was like,
I just,
no,
I don't,

1260
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:48.820
I don't think that's what's going on.
I don't like it.
And it doesn't,
I don't,

1261
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.440
I get offended when he says that.
Like,
wow,
she knew because she knows him,

1262
01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:54.790
you know,
she's had experience with them.

1263
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:57.850
So I thought that was pretty fascinating and it coming from anybody else.

1264
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:03.010
I might go,
ah,
she's just fucking sensitive.
But Amy Schumer is a bad ass bitch.

1265
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:07.180
No,
she is.
She gets what she wants.
She's not sensitive,
you know?

1266
01:17:07.181 --> 01:17:11.570
I mean she's not over sensitive,
so I was like,
Huh,
but here's you know it,

1267
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:15.350
it's his,
it's his,
it's hundred percent.

1268
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.170
If he wanted to do it the same four people over and over again,

1269
01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:20.810
it's his prerogative and he could do that.
It's like him.

1270
01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.260
That's like him saying to her,
how can we not putting this person on your shell?

1271
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:29.410
You know everybody goes to the diversity thing is diversity is is easy to

1272
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.840
attack,
fucking attack diversity.
But you know what,

1273
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:36.260
there's not diversity throughout life and a lot of things.

1274
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:37.760
While we were talking about at lunch today,

1275
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:41.540
we're talking about the Nobel prize winners in the size of how many European

1276
01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:44.780
Jews.
Yes there are that are like super genius.

1277
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:49.070
European Jews mean it's kind of crazy and I'm not going to give a Nobel prize to

1278
01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:54.071
some fucking guy from Uganda that had two months in fucking in med school

1279
01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:56.890
because you know,
you know what I'm saying?

1280
01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:01.900
So diversity is and racism and the race card is a quick way out of it and female

1281
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:04.670
card and all that.
I agree.

1282
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:09.560
Amy Schumer has gotten everything she's gotten cause she's funny and works hard.

1283
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.870
So I mean I don't know what she's fucking,

1284
01:18:14.871 --> 01:18:15.671
she kills he,

1285
01:18:15.671 --> 01:18:19.610
I don't know what the issue was or why it was kind of got to go deeper than
yeah,

1286
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.190
she didn't want him to do it though.
She was like dancing around.

1287
01:18:22.191 --> 01:18:24.890
I tried to get her to talk about it,
you know,

1288
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.880
she was not interested but you know,
I respect that,
you know,
she's,

1289
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:32.750
everyone has their own path.
But see the reason why I would harp on it,

1290
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:36.020
it's cause she's not sensitive because she could hang at that table cause she's,

1291
01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:40.360
she's fucking funny.
Play that thing with her and Mike Tyson the road.

1292
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.460
She's sharp.
She is rude.
I just sent her a text.
She is,

1293
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.150
Patrice stole that fucking roast.

1294
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:51.790
He fucking stole that is part of that rose.
Oh yeah,

1295
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.350
he was a monster.
He was so funny.
Fucking,

1296
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.960
he was so funny because he was so funny the way he would bust balls too.

1297
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.490
Like one time I called up and Anthony was talking about guns and he's talking

1298
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:07.850
about carrying guns and,
and I was like,
um,
I go,

1299
01:19:07.851 --> 01:19:11.600
don't you ever worry that like having this gun around all the time,

1300
01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:13.090
like you're constantly holding on the guns.

1301
01:19:13.091 --> 01:19:17.630
We got guns are any house that it may be like you might manifest something and

1302
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:20.750
uh,
Patrice go see Joe Rogan believes in magic.

1303
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.900
He goes,
Joe's magical.
He's like conjuring shit.
Huh?

1304
01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.550
Do you ever seen a bit dated?
I know I didn't see the whole thing.

1305
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:35.430
Who could catch a cab quicker?
Well,

1306
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:38.930
they said the nonsuit the nigger was the bit trees would,
uh,

1307
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:43.760
we'd go out and they would pick up the Nazi twice as much as they would pick up

1308
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:48.650
a trees.
Susan.
It was unbelievable.
So ridiculous.
Oh,

1309
01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:53.150
and they had some of the fucking funniest gags ever.
Oh yeah.
To this day,

1310
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:58.390
baby bird is the funniest thing I've ever been a parking laugh to this day.

1311
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:59.500
Posture's

1312
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.221
<v 7>thing.
Wow.</v>

1313
01:20:00.221 --> 01:20:04.900
That's a beautiful HD video has shot by someone taking a cell phone video of a

1314
01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:07.530
cell phone video from the moon.

1315
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:11.580
<v 6>See if we could find another version of that that's just so bad.</v>

1316
01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:15.210
We can't even air that.
It does sound like shit.
Well we,

1317
01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:18.460
we should do Roche at Boston Comedy Club,
but we were all friends like we've,

1318
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:24.360
there's some of them somewhere like those trees Norton me,

1319
01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:29.250
you know,
and it was all friends on these fucking Roche.
So it was kindness.

1320
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.750
They stood up for what he thought was wrong.
What was wrong,
wasn't it?

1321
01:20:33.751 --> 01:20:38.580
And you getting screwed by somebody getting too much money or something.
No,
no.

1322
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:41.670
For some show doing coke and they fired him.

1323
01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:48.120
He was smoking mad amounts of freebase and doing blow allegedly.

1324
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:50.880
And they fired him because he was talking about it all the time.

1325
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.330
Like how could that be like whatever.
But most of that's funny shit.
Oh Shit.

1326
01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:00.400
Actually it was Adley like he told me that that's not what he had planned a lot

1327
01:21:00.751 --> 01:21:01.610
of it because

1328
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:06.600
shit about him that's kind of staying close.
Huh?

1329
01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.880
That's what some of those had of stilling.
The Jessalyn they're corn.
Yeah.

1330
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.870
I talked to him two nights before for like two hours I was talking to on the

1331
01:21:12.871 --> 01:21:15.150
phone for that.
I'm not just trying to,
it just cause we were,
you know,

1332
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:18.420
like what the fuck am I doing?
I don't like these mother fuckers.

1333
01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:24.660
It comes from like I said,
look,

1334
01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.490
I'm going to put you over the top.
I mean he was going to do it,
but he just was,

1335
01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.560
he needed other people say just fucking do it,
isn't it?
You know,

1336
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.700
but cause he said I,

1337
01:21:33.710 --> 01:21:37.710
he turned down a bunch of them because he didn't know the people.

1338
01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:41.910
He was roasting,
Roasting Norton and me,

1339
01:21:41.911 --> 01:21:45.810
Bobby and Collin were up there and Keith,
he wouldn't do it.
You know what I mean?

1340
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:50.640
He doesn't know these fucking people and he thinks and he was true and he

1341
01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.650
thought and he was 100% right.

1342
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:58.110
He's had a whole nother level than all of them.
So who are they to talk about me?

1343
01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.330
You know what I mean?
That's what he's thinking.

1344
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:03.540
Like who is this motherfucker to talk about me?

1345
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.910
And that's what it doesn't make sense about him.

1346
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:08.640
That doesn't like to say something about it.
I mean,

1347
01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:14.370
that's the next a funny cat man.
I,
you know,
he's a funny dude.

1348
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:18.810
That's kind of her funny dude,
you know.
But how many years ago was that?

1349
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:22.930
That was like three,
four years ago.
Right now,
you know,

1350
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.030
but just on next to funny fucking guy.
I mean,
but at the time Patrice,

1351
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:31.950
like who the fuck is,
hey,
Amy wasn't as big as she was four years,
you know,

1352
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:36.180
over the cow.
That's what made her famous.

1353
01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:40.560
And a lot of ways that's what put her over the top.
Well,
her hard work,
but that,

1354
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.880
you know,
it's like once she did that,
then people got a chance to pay attention.

1355
01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:46.470
All the other stuff that she was doing well,
but a lot of,
you know,

1356
01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:48.900
a lot of them killed fucking,
what's her name?

1357
01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:53.901
Natasha had a line of her line and this was one of the best roast lines I ever

1358
01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:59.640
fucking heard.
Uh,
she said,

1359
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:02.880
so we play it.
I played too much roast,

1360
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:08.680
let's play it cause the doshas on soon.
Anyway,
it was funny to me.

1361
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:13.890
Yeah.
What Roche was it?
It was the Charlie Sheen rose,
right?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1362
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.990
Was Franco James Franco.
Yeah,
that was it.
Natasha.

1363
01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:21.480
Alicia fucking the one line,
you know,

1364
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:24.160
to why they beep and shit.

1365
01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:26.800
There's some kind of tried to find the uncut version out.

1366
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.240
When was this place is fucking dull.
This place is buzzing.

1367
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.970
Oh,
that's around as he's his family.

1368
01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.020
That's the bugs family

1369
01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:44.530
disease.
Holy Shit.
She was,
I thought that was funny.

1370
01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.160
He's funny man.
She's fucking fucking funny.
That's fucking good dude.

1371
01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.070
Did you watch that?
Steevo a video?
No,
no.

1372
01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:53.740
We were talking about it before the podcast.
You showed me a picture of it.

1373
01:23:53.741 --> 01:23:56.570
But is he going public with this?
Oh yeah.

1374
01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:01.050
He tweeted it and put it on his own youtube and he told me before he was going

1375
01:24:01.051 --> 01:24:01.361
to do it,

1376
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:04.300
cause I was in San Diego when he did it and he and I was like saying the same

1377
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:08.020
thing you said to me.
Well it's like this is like bad you,

1378
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:11.890
you would get in a lot of trouble for this.
Let's explain what he did right here.

1379
01:24:11.891 --> 01:24:14.680
Let's just watch it.
Here's the video.
Well,

1380
01:24:14.681 --> 01:24:18.990
let's tell people at home that are putting my foot down for Shaman.

1381
01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:24.590
<v 8>He's printing out a sign at Kinko's.
Yeah.</v>

1382
01:24:24.591 --> 01:24:29.591
He's printing out a giant sign that says sucks and he's throwing up a rope to

1383
01:24:30.691 --> 01:24:35.460
the top of this billboard or a traffic sign where,

1384
01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:36.294
uh,

1385
01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:41.220
he's climbing this fucking rope with his crazy like during the day

1386
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:44.450
<v 6>and it's during the day.
Yeah.</v>

1387
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.580
<v 8>He had to get gloves.
He was tearing his hands apart.</v>

1388
01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.800
So he's just climbing is fucking rope to the top of this traffic sign.
And then,

1389
01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:56.430
uh,
it says seaworld and he's going to write sucks next to it.

1390
01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.080
Now they got some guys from the local beach too to help just pull him up by his

1391
01:25:03.661 --> 01:25:04.494
ankle

1392
01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.910
<v 9>on a rope.
Yeah,
they're all pulling him up.</v>

1393
01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:12.690
His kids,
he's trying to figure out how to get up there.
If you fall from there,

1394
01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.100
by the way,
you're fuck Ceville no one called the Felice like he's a terrorist.

1395
01:25:17.101 --> 01:25:19.090
He's hanging by his ankle.
Oh Shit.

1396
01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:20.993
<v 6>Oh fuck.</v>

1397
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.130
<v 8>Dude.
Day Too.
That's a bad way to fall.
He fell on his head.</v>

1398
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:31.810
How's he?
Okay.
It's made out of rough.
Oh Shit.
Oh my God.

1399
01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:35.430
He fell again.
Oh my God.
He says Jack.
Yes.

1400
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.600
<v 9>Went and got a goddamn ladder at home depot.</v>

1401
01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.830
A ladder that he's climbing up to the top of this traffic sign.

1402
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:49.810
He's crazy and he's putting the sticker that he had printed up on.

1403
01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:54.310
Kinko's got the wrong color green unfortunately.
And it says sea world sucks.

1404
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.160
<v 8>This chain of jumping</v>

1405
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.250
<v 10>stripe here.
See where on the other hand,
sex terror.</v>

1406
01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:12.800
So share this video with the Hashtag.
See what else sucks.

1407
01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:17.540
<v 6>Yeah.
He did a flip off the roof into a swimming pool.
We seen that video before.</v>

1408
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:20.210
No,
I don't even want to see that shit gives me anxiety.

1409
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.070
I can't even watch it at three.
They get us.

1410
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.580
We were talking about before the podcast is that that's kind of illegal.

1411
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:27.740
It has to be like a federal offense,

1412
01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:31.810
like fucking with male type situation.
I don't think you're right.

1413
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.060
Private property.
It's vandalism.
I don't think it's private property.

1414
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:38.880
I think it's federal property.
I'm pretty sure date side of the highway.

1415
01:26:38.881 --> 01:26:41.900
The state.
Okay,
let's,
let's Google it.

1416
01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:44.250
How illegal is it to deface a sign,

1417
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:50.390
a traffic sign?
I saw the traffic sign.
Yeah.
That's uh,

1418
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.090
advertisement sign or whatever.
Right.

1419
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:59.640
But it's not a billboard.
It's fine now how illegal.
Yeah.

1420
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:02.450
<v 1>I'm just surprised in San Diego,
super military,</v>

1421
01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:05.420
you see a guy with a bunch of ropes climbing a sign that people aren't like

1422
01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:08.110
calling the police.
Like,
Whoa,
dude,
there's some terrorists,
you know,

1423
01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.770
assign trying to build up,

1424
01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:13.870
<v 6>not one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm trying to find it.</v>

1425
01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.510
This is probably gonna be a annoying to try and figure out and I'm sure he got a

1426
01:27:18.511 --> 01:27:19.220
lawyer.

1427
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.570
<v 11>A law though.</v>

1428
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.100
<v 6>It seems like a city.
A city ordinance.</v>

1429
01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:27.790
<v 11>I might be wrong though.
I Dunno.</v>

1430
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:31.210
<v 6>Do you face highway travel?
Me when we were at highway traffic side,</v>

1431
01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.980
because it might be different.

1432
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:37.720
The difference between defacing a a traffic sign on a,
um,

1433
01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:43.800
on a regular street that might be like less illegal possession of a traffic
sign.

1434
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:48.190
<v 1>By the way,
this is this is that,
uh,
at the end,</v>

1435
01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.380
this isn't a San Diego News.
At the end of the video,
he says,

1436
01:27:50.381 --> 01:27:52.870
if doing that was wrong,
I don't want to be right.

1437
01:27:52.871 --> 01:27:55.420
Scree zeroed Glover's comment below the video says,

1438
01:27:55.421 --> 01:27:58.630
be an awesome person by sharing this video with the Hashtag c road sucks.

1439
01:27:58.631 --> 01:28:02.810
And then he released the statement,
uh,
about Steve Video Confession and,

1440
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:03.761
and he says,

1441
01:28:03.761 --> 01:28:08.040
we consider defacing public property at a cost of state taxpayers and Unlawful

1442
01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.490
Act in a dangerous distraction for motorists.

1443
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:14.050
We all refer all information to the California highway patrol,

1444
01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:17.260
but he didn't really,
you know,
oh,
it was just a sticker.

1445
01:28:17.261 --> 01:28:19.680
They just had to peel it off.
So there was no damage.
But yeah,

1446
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:22.330
<v 6>but he would have sat about distracting people.
That is an issue.</v>

1447
01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:23.261
That is an issue,

1448
01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:26.600
especially now because people are going to hear about it from his video are

1449
01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:29.950
going to go looking for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He shouldn't do that.

1450
01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.670
He could go to jail for that shit.
It's just amazing that he's okay.

1451
01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.980
I know Paul's falls.
He fell fucking twice,

1452
01:28:35.981 --> 01:28:39.340
once on his head and the other time is ladder broke.
I mean,
he's ridiculous.

1453
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:42.760
That's he fell from fucking really high up,
man.

1454
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.530
That's what it's made out of rubber.

1455
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:47.880
<v 1>Do you think there's some people that's bodies can just take it a little bit</v>

1456
01:28:47.881 --> 01:28:48.750
better?
Like it's just,

1457
01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:49.830
<v 6>Oh,
I don't know.</v>

1458
01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:55.990
His volunteer have all been broken in and you know,

1459
01:28:56.710 --> 01:29:00.700
he's just,
he knows how to fall,
you know?
I think he knows how to stay relaxed.

1460
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:05.760
He probably felt right here.
It fell a little bit higher than he would have fun.

1461
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:08.870
Wouldn't it be fucked if he got paralyzed when he was putting up a seaworld

1462
01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:09.723
sucks.

1463
01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.310
He could have easily right phone hanging by his ankle and he falls on his head

1464
01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:14.881
and machine.
No,

1465
01:29:14.881 --> 01:29:19.290
he's fucking selling and working in the ticket booth that she world because he

1466
01:29:19.291 --> 01:29:23.090
only fucking move with his fucking head are now.
Everybody was wanting to cc

1467
01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:25.503
mouth.

1468
01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:30.260
Divo get you ticket for you.
Yes.

1469
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:34.080
He has to blow in this draw to make the ticket come up.

1470
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:40.140
I got to take it from Steve.
He's all head now.
It's weird.

1471
01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.550
Doesn't eat light bulbs.
Just crazy.
Fuck you.

1472
01:29:46.551 --> 01:29:50.250
But he breaks light bulbs and cuts his tongue up with him.
He's so crazy,

1473
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:55.070
like some of the shit that he's done.
It's just so hard to watch
comedy clubs.

1474
01:29:55.110 --> 01:30:00.060
Comedy clubs cracked me up man.
Like if fucking,
uh,
somebody got upset at him,

1475
01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:05.160
somebody who was it out,
she got upset at him
because of a,

1476
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.650
you know,
they were like,
he's not a real comic.
You makes me laugh.

1477
01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.640
He does a good show,
I think.
Well,
I mean,

1478
01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.520
look if in some clubs and say,
hey listen,

1479
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:18.180
if Cameron Diaz called a club and said I wanted to do next week,
they would go,

1480
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:21.090
all right,
we'll give you Friday,
Saturday.
You know,
it's,

1481
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:24.780
if they could sell tickets for sure it's so fucking ticket.
But he does,

1482
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:27.900
he actually doesn't act like he hasn't asked if he's,
he,

1483
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.650
he's very good story telling you like very storyteller,

1484
01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.340
but he puts his little jokes and stabs and stuff in there.

1485
01:30:35.341 --> 01:30:39.780
So I mean he does it right.
Like he,
he's been doing it for a long time.

1486
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:44.340
Like he does it a little bit like I think it's used to public talking and stuff

1487
01:30:44.341 --> 01:30:47.160
because he used to be in the circus growing up and stuff like that.

1488
01:30:47.161 --> 01:30:51.050
So he's just always been an entertainer his whole entire life.
I,
you know,

1489
01:30:51.370 --> 01:30:54.240
I love when a guy like Patrice makes fun of Shit.
You know,

1490
01:30:54.241 --> 01:30:55.080
I think it's Hilarious,

1491
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:58.530
but I really don't honestly personally have a problem with anybody's style of

1492
01:30:58.531 --> 01:31:02.220
comedy.
And I might not like it,
but I'm not going to,
I don't,
it doesn't upset me.

1493
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:06.780
No,
not at all.
Hacky shit upsets me if I have to follow it.

1494
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.600
You know,
like if you watch a guy who's just doing something terrible,

1495
01:31:09.690 --> 01:31:11.910
the real problem is if someone's doing something terrible,

1496
01:31:11.911 --> 01:31:14.430
it can get in your head and then it gets you,

1497
01:31:14.431 --> 01:31:17.130
puts you in a bad mood and you don't,
you don't think anything's really funny.

1498
01:31:17.131 --> 01:31:20.160
You're not like in the right state cause he listened to this terrible act.

1499
01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:23.990
Well it's not the act I hate as much as the audience for laughing at it and be,

1500
01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.430
I told you,
I said,
have you got one inch?
I've Dev skill.
No,

1501
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.770
but they don't know any better.
Joe Just,
you know,

1502
01:31:31.771 --> 01:31:34.950
they're watching storage wars and they're fucking,
you know,

1503
01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:37.910
what did they know about,
hey look at this dude just said fucking,

1504
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:41.730
I'm the only ship to Kilkee.
Wow.
That's hilarious.
Do you remember when it was,

1505
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:45.990
when you were just going to comedy clubs before you actually became a comedian?

1506
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:49.620
I only went to,
Shit.
I went to two,
two times to a comedy club twice.

1507
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.410
I went to penny arcade and catch a rising star.

1508
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:58.040
I remember going and being shocked at how easy it is to make people laugh.

1509
01:31:58.890 --> 01:32:00.160
I was like,
I don't understand what's going

1510
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.040
<v 2>on here.
Like stuff that doesn't make me laugh is getting people to laugh,</v>

1511
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:05.110
but stuff that I thought was funny back then.

1512
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:08.290
Now I think it's unbelievably terrible.
Like within a year or two,

1513
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.520
I saw it through like,

1514
01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:12.590
there was a lot of comics that I was coming up with that were like a couple of

1515
01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.610
steps ahead of me that were middling.
They were doing well and uh,
you know,

1516
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:17.500
they're pros.
They would work on the road a little bit.

1517
01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:20.110
And I remember that they would be at a comedy club.
I'd be like,
Whoa,

1518
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:24.040
that's such and such.
He's a pro.
And then like two years later I'm like,
oh,

1519
01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:28.960
that guy's terrible.
Oh,
I thought he was a pro.
He's,
he's dog shit.

1520
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:32.170
He's never going anywhere.
I mean,
and I think he's still funny.

1521
01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.310
Why haven't you seen Jack?

1522
01:32:33.311 --> 01:32:37.960
But I went to catch Roger shot or second time I went to see comedy and I was

1523
01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:41.660
watching Hiram Castin I go to,
she is the funniest man alive.

1524
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:45.310
I used to funnyish made,
but I didn't know.
He just,
you know,
I mean,

1525
01:32:45.311 --> 01:32:48.070
I knew comedy from growing up to know his act.

1526
01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.820
It was just an old [inaudible] style.
I just,

1527
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:57.070
I should come home from school in fourth grade.
No,
not for second,

1528
01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.130
second or third grade.
And I figured out later in life,
you know,

1529
01:33:00.131 --> 01:33:04.510
my parents were divorced going through a divorce and a horrible,
you know,

1530
01:33:04.511 --> 01:33:07.290
we have to live here without dad and you know,
and,

1531
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:12.840
and I guess my comfort zone was such in a comedy and I will come home from

1532
01:33:13.541 --> 01:33:18.540
school every day and listened to Vaughn meter.
Uh,
the first family,
uh,

1533
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:23.580
he did Kenny the impressions and it was the funniest thing on the planet.

1534
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:28.810
He had the Kennedys down to a science,

1535
01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:32.830
to a science,
and he was the hottest comic back then.

1536
01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.980
And then the Kennedys were assassinated.

1537
01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:42.760
He liked,
they say he went from Park Avenue to park bench.
He was,

1538
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:47.530
he died of alcoholism,
I'm pretty sure.
But he was,
if you never heard it,
I mean,

1539
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:51.490
he just,
it was the first family Vaughn meter.
Did you ever get to see,
uh,

1540
01:33:51.491 --> 01:33:55.140
what was his name?
Bob Woods I worked with,
I've worked with what told me,

1541
01:33:55.150 --> 01:33:58.630
I could tell you a good crack.
Shorty would,
would a good drug shortage.
We,
uh,

1542
01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.700
Bob will tell everybody who Bob woods was.

1543
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:05.260
Bob Woods was this big legend in like the long island.

1544
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:08.950
Seeing you're like,
a lot of guys ripped that guy off.
Bob Woods was,

1545
01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:12.700
he looked like a bait captain.
Kangaroo.

1546
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:17.740
He had curly blonde hair,
a mustache,
big,

1547
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.870
sweetest guy on the planet.
Not,
you know,

1548
01:34:22.871 --> 01:34:27.340
he helped,
like he would help younger guys.
You know,
you're just a nice guy.

1549
01:34:27.341 --> 01:34:30.340
He was a pot.
He drank,
he partied.
He,
he just was,

1550
01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:35.240
his dream was to work rascals,
headline,
rascals.

1551
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:40.120
That was his dream.
So,
and we did tons of one night,

1552
01:34:40.121 --> 01:34:42.970
or if we did this,
we did Betty's fireside,
like I said,

1553
01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:47.440
which was the thunder dome,
this place,
he leaped over to bar.

1554
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:52.190
This guy was gigantic on a guy to fucking dish,

1555
01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:55.360
you know,
rip them to pieces for just nonstop heckling.

1556
01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.240
You just saw Bob just fucking leap.
Uh,

1557
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.460
but a sweetheart too,
you know what I mean?
So me and him,

1558
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:10.640
we did a,
we did some one night or we go,
let's go get some,

1559
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:15.140
some cracks and freebase uh,
we'll go up to Harlem.

1560
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.620
Uh,
I don't even know if he ever tried it.
I might've said,

1561
01:35:19.621 --> 01:35:22.490
you've got to try this shit or whatever.
Or he might've done it.
I don't know.

1562
01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:27.650
So we took a cab up to Harlem,
Spanish Harlem.

1563
01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:32.210
We bought a bunch of freebase.
So we said to the cab driver,

1564
01:35:32.211 --> 01:35:36.410
can you take us to New Jersey?
We were going to Epilito Shouse,

1565
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.700
chip CUNY or whatever,

1566
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.680
and we're in the back seat and to cab drivers going,

1567
01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:43.910
you gotta be careful on this shared.

1568
01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:46.880
So there's stuff out here called crack and they'll kill you over it.

1569
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:49.130
And the whole time we're in the backseat smoking it.

1570
01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:53.480
So then the cab drivers sees a smoke and it goes,
can I have some of that?

1571
01:35:54.230 --> 01:35:56.300
So we gave him some and then we went back to

1572
01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:02.990
Epilito his house and the cab drivers spent all his money on coke there and we

1573
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:08.540
smoked freebase all night long to the next morning.

1574
01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:13.880
And the cab driver went home broke.
How will you still healthy?

1575
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:17.740
I was a healthy.
How are you right now?
Still healthy with all this,

1576
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.680
all the freebies.
All the crud.
I only did it for two,
two or three years.

1577
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:24.410
That's it.
Yeah.
But it was a long,
two or three years.

1578
01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:28.550
Two or three years or fucking,
you know,
two or three if you're lucky,

1579
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:32.240
you fucking got out of that because how many people do we know that did it for a

1580
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:33.830
long time and they're just dead.

1581
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.210
Their nervous system is just shocked too on how many people who like were really

1582
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:42.350
in coke.
Like that was one of the speculations about Robin with Parkinson's.

1583
01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.890
I don't know if there's a direct correlation between Parkinson's and cocaine
use,

1584
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:50.120
but there was one of the speculations that I'd read that like Robin was like a

1585
01:36:50.121 --> 01:36:53.060
famous guy for doing a lot of coke and he'd done it for a long time.

1586
01:36:53.061 --> 01:36:56.630
It struggled back and forth with addiction,
uh,
but that,
uh,

1587
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.080
see neurological disorders and cocaine's it could be somehow or another

1588
01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:03.110
connected,
willing to king.
Did you ever just clean Robin in a coke addict?

1589
01:37:03.111 --> 01:37:03.944
Like me?

1590
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:09.350
Robin always had money so he could get as much coke as he fucking want.

1591
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:14.480
I didn't have money so I couldn't get,
you know,
I was 40,

1592
01:37:14.481 --> 01:37:17.720
$50 a night or hearing and you know what I mean,
or whatever.
I think he was,

1593
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:21.620
he was a giant movie star,
right?
Yeah.
I mean he was,

1594
01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:25.580
that was like during the Popeye days.
Right.
Fucking garb and fucking,
you know,

1595
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.760
fucking money and saving money and you know,

1596
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:32.750
and when you got that same wood prior fucking prior,
you know,

1597
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.910
cooking that they have fucking ounces.

1598
01:37:34.911 --> 01:37:39.710
I'm cooking up a half a gram or a gram and fucking looking to do hand jobs,

1599
01:37:39.711 --> 01:37:40.890
whatever.
Just,
oh.

1600
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:47.120
But his dream was to work rascals and I think he finally got it,

1601
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:53.000
that he was booked there and it was somewhere on the road working and he got a

1602
01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:56.110
pain and he got a stone or something,
a kidney or gallstone

1603
01:37:56.110 --> 01:37:57.960
<v 5>that broke through his stomach or something.</v>

1604
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:02.850
And he passed away that right before he was going to do headline rascal.
Ah,

1605
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.380
you know,
and that was,
you know,
there wasn't a lot of TV.
He,
he's,
he's no,

1606
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:11.940
a video of him online.
I looked for it.
The,
there's,
he was apparently in comedies.

1607
01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:14.880
Dirtiest doesn't,
but it's not available.

1608
01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.820
It's not available on Youtube.
Well,
there was something he came from knows him,

1609
01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.760
knows there was long island acts,
you know Hawthorne and

1610
01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.000
Bob Nelson.
There was a lot of those good guys.

1611
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:34.470
How spear there was a lot of,
then there's nothing,
there's no video for him.

1612
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:37.800
For Bob Boyd as weird when a good guy,

1613
01:38:37.801 --> 01:38:41.550
he really was so nice to me.
Was He showing nice to me?
He used to,

1614
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:46.290
he just was nice and he was a headliner and I always knew when he would just be,

1615
01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:47.124
you know what I mean?

1616
01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.260
Well there was a lot of those guys back then that we're a regional guys that

1617
01:38:52.261 --> 01:38:55.380
were like uh,
like everybody loved like famous,

1618
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.880
like the auto and George type guys.

1619
01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:01.200
They were like sorta regional too that you know like the northeast.

1620
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:07.320
Yeah.
Fucking Otto the best stories.
But he was the,
Otto was a sweetheart.

1621
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:10.980
He's a great guy.
Very,
very nice guy sweetheart.
Yeah,
there was a lot of,

1622
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:13.350
I mean I don't know what's a lot of assholes.

1623
01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:18.760
The best thing that ever happened to a stand up comedy in New York.

1624
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:19.801
There was two things.

1625
01:39:19.801 --> 01:39:24.090
One was Collin's tough crowd cause everybody got to see all those guys together

1626
01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.860
shooting the shit.
And uh,

1627
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:30.300
you remember when Geraldo got into it with Denis leary tortured him all.

1628
01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:34.230
It was so beautiful.
It was so beautiful.
Everybody was like,
yes.

1629
01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:38.040
And he didn't even go far enough.
No.
I mean he was really kind like what he did.

1630
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:39.960
But if you've ever seen that,

1631
01:39:39.961 --> 01:39:44.961
it's one of the most telling pull up Greg Geraldo versus Denis leary on tough

1632
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:48.900
crowd.
I'd love tough crowd.
I was so bummed out when that show was canceled.

1633
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:54.120
It was when it was canceled to me it was like almost like my divorce.

1634
01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:59.030
That's how I felt.
Yeah,
it was a,
it was a real tough blow.

1635
01:39:59.031 --> 01:40:03.560
But the other thing is ona,
ONA was fucking fantastic,
man.

1636
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:09.370
Ona was fantastic because ONA was like the first time they had a show where I'm

1637
01:40:09.651 --> 01:40:13.100
such a dummy,
I wrote comedy,
dirtiest desert

1638
01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.950
and uh,
for whatever reason doesn't,
doesn't,
um,

1639
01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:24.050
iTunes couldn't recognize it.
Um,
I dunno.
It's just,

1640
01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.300
just an awesome time.
What do you call it?

1641
01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.790
That Geraldo Dennis
hilarity thing though,

1642
01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.980
you got to respect.
And as silly for the fact that I thought that was much more,

1643
01:40:36.981 --> 01:40:39.920
I hadn't seen that in years.
That was brutal.
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen,

1644
01:40:39.921 --> 01:40:41.520
if you listen to this while,
well,

1645
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:44.220
if I could go back in time and give you five minutes,
I would.
Well,

1646
01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:46.730
the problem was we listened to too much before it.

1647
01:40:46.731 --> 01:40:50.420
If we just heard that from where he started to the fight there,

1648
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:54.010
but the what you miss out is how mad Dennis

1649
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.310
<v 6>got.
Like when he like you don't talk to me like that.
Like his face.</v>

1650
01:40:57.311 --> 01:40:58.270
Like who the fuck are you?

1651
01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:03.530
Put Your Rabo is a funny fucking dude who was in accomplish comedian too.

1652
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:07.900
He's a real comic.
Yeah.
I mean he's not wearing sunglasses on a fucking TV show.

1653
01:41:07.901 --> 01:41:12.400
That's what Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
It's,
you know,
if you're not,

1654
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:15.700
if you're not black and you were in sunglasses on a TV show,
go fuck yourself.

1655
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.510
I would say black guys get a pass was gonna pass line guys,

1656
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:22.870
famous black guy like Floyd Mayweather.
Wear sunglasses on a TV show.
I go,
okay,

1657
01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.400
I get it.
Floyd Mayweather.
It's different community.
But if you're a white guy,

1658
01:41:27.490 --> 01:41:30.100
you got sunglasses on a TV show,
fuck off.

1659
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.090
So what you're saying is you're not big fan.
I'm racist.

1660
01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:41.080
I'm racist towards,
towards black guys.
I prefer them.

1661
01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:47.330
I give them special leeway.
I'm good friend.
Um,
I,

1662
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:50.620
I'll take black eyes over most white people.
Well it's just,

1663
01:41:50.621 --> 01:41:55.090
it's a different thing.
I Dunno why,
but it just is,
you know,
she a black eye.

1664
01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.890
That's a famous guy on award shows with sunglasses on it.

1665
01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:01.180
It doesn't bother me unless it's Kanye and I'm like,
come on dude,

1666
01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:03.220
take those fuckers.
You haven't,
you've suffered enough.

1667
01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.520
I'll take her gay black over a gay white any day more funny.
You think,

1668
01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:12.670
wait my mind as comics or,
and it wasn't human.
I take gay,
gay,

1669
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:16.080
gay,
black sounds too.

1670
01:42:16.170 --> 01:42:19.770
And it goes to the extreme.
It's too,
it's,

1671
01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:24.790
it's too gay.
It's adorable and hilarious,
but it's like,

1672
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:28.780
it's a whole nother level.
Like when,
you know what I mean?
Like,
I mean,

1673
01:42:28.781 --> 01:42:33.100
shearers gay,
black and Shiri skylight.
Why?
What are you talking about?

1674
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:37.090
He knows what I'm talking about.
Talking.
He knows what I'm talking about.

1675
01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:41.110
No one knows who they are.
They all know,
you know,

1676
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:45.630
I've talked with the flamboyant,
uh,

1677
01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:49.900
they're more flamboyant and some generalized,

1678
01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.800
you know,
it's tough,
but you already did gay blacks would fuck

1679
01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:01.690
you started this whole thing.
I'm pro black.
I am too.

1680
01:43:01.691 --> 01:43:05.310
I give them the leeway to wear the glasses.
It's what I call white people on it.

1681
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.260
What,
why people were not allowed to wear glasses.
Especially,
you know,

1682
01:43:08.261 --> 01:43:11.260
that's the other thing,
like a comic that gets to like fashion conscious.

1683
01:43:11.261 --> 01:43:14.140
It's like we were talking about Russell and his crazy fucking jacket and I love

1684
01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:14.860
Russell,

1685
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.710
but I'm glad you called them on it because otherwise he would've wore that twice

1686
01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:21.550
a fucking whore.
Fucking horrible jacket.
Let me tell you,

1687
01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.590
Jesus,
I fucking rather,
where do you Bola fucking horrible.
Uh,

1688
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.800
hey.
How many poor people will die to that shit.
Is that,
is that over?

1689
01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:36.580
They contain that stuff still in the papers are showing dead bodies and all
that.

1690
01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:40.390
Oh,
what a fucking terrible way to go.
I've been reading on Ebola,

1691
01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:44.960
like what it is like,
what the effects are,
the hemorrhagic effects.

1692
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:49.930
I can't read on diseases.
Don't fucking give you a break.

1693
01:43:49.931 --> 01:43:52.070
You out your free [inaudible].
Yeah,
it freaks

1694
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.230
<v 0>me the fuck out because there's people that are going over there that are</v>

1695
01:43:54.231 --> 01:43:55.220
helping,
you know,

1696
01:43:55.221 --> 01:43:58.700
like a aids workers and stuff and they come back and they're fucked up with the

1697
01:43:58.701 --> 01:43:59.510
Ebola.

1698
01:43:59.510 --> 01:44:02.390
There's been a two of them so far that have been delivered to the United States

1699
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:06.800
that are,
that have Ebola and whether or not they make it's touch and go,

1700
01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.370
you know.
Well I think they let one out of the hospital now,
but I'm saying,

1701
01:44:10.371 --> 01:44:12.430
you know,
once you get it,
I think that the,
uh,

1702
01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:17.210
the expectancy is like 40%,
40% death expectancy.

1703
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:19.590
Jesus fucking Gary Man.

1704
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:26.150
<v 2>And what is it?
And this has nothing to do,</v>

1705
01:44:26.151 --> 01:44:29.270
but they're all coming from Africa.
These fucking

1706
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.870
<v 0>sanitation,
the of,
there's a lot of issues.
Biodiversity,</v>

1707
01:44:33.871 --> 01:44:35.160
I'm sure jungles

1708
01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:38.800
<v 2>thinking that once you have,
you can't get it again or is that a good question?</v>

1709
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:42.280
Which takes super doctors.
Well that's what a vaccine.

1710
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.200
You can't get it again cause you're dead.

1711
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:49.240
It's just Chi.

1712
01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:54.300
I was just in buffalo in this open miker had the funniest bit about the Ebola

1713
01:44:54.401 --> 01:44:58.600
virus and it was an open,
no,
he may be a five year comic.

1714
01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.290
It was so fun.
I wish I knew his name so I could show you his name.
But he said,

1715
01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:03.124
uh,

1716
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:07.390
they just brought two doctors back with the Ebola virus.

1717
01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:12.010
He goes,
thank God they were white because I hate to be at the airport yelling,

1718
01:45:12.011 --> 01:45:13.960
go back to Africa.
If they weren't

1719
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:22.300
Aha to fuck.
How clever and funny.
That's a good joke.
You know.

1720
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:27.300
I knew a dude.
There was a comic years ago.
This is how fucking shit.

1721
01:45:27.301 --> 01:45:31.750
I'm a hypochondria.
He fucking died of meningitis.
Jerry red wheels.

1722
01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.960
Cabriolet wrongs.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
Yeah.
He's a great guy.
He's very,

1723
01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:39.550
very well.
Yeah,
it was a great car.
And when you get meningitis,

1724
01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:45.540
you can't touch your chin to your chest because your spine swells up into back.

1725
01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:48.040
Ooh,
really?

1726
01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:52.450
So for a week I thought I had meningitis and I'm fucking walking around like

1727
01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.590
this and people are looking at me like,
like,
I'm fucking nuts.

1728
01:45:56.610 --> 01:45:59.140
Can you had it for a week and you didn't go to a doctor?
No,
I just,

1729
01:45:59.141 --> 01:46:02.590
in my head I'm going,
oh,
what if I had this,
let me check.
I didn't think I,

1730
01:46:02.591 --> 01:46:05.950
you know,
I mean I go there and I will do that and maybe it was two days,

1731
01:46:05.951 --> 01:46:10.450
but I'm a comic so I exaggerated a little,
sorry.
Sorry for fucking really,

1732
01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:14.470
maybe it was probably an hour or maybe it was just walking to fucking blocks.

1733
01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:18.520
I don't fucking know.
All right,
it's three hours.

1734
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.560
I can't be on fucking point every second.

1735
01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:25.570
So I went like this and ash,
why I don't read,
you know,
people walking by going,

1736
01:46:25.571 --> 01:46:27.340
oh,
I think,
I think he,
you know,

1737
01:46:27.341 --> 01:46:29.720
we think he thinks he has meningitis because what else was said?

1738
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:34.120
You know what I'm saying?
But I can't read that shit cause I get fucking,

1739
01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:38.170
you know,
hypochondriac.
You just,
when you get older you start to think,

1740
01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.770
well what the fuck?
I look at the Ige.
Oh,
I got to have some tin.

1741
01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:46.180
It's the fucking odds.
How healthy are you?
Like,

1742
01:46:46.181 --> 01:46:49.000
as far as like what you eat and I exercise.
Oh,
I don't,

1743
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:53.880
I haven't had red meat and probably 23 years I fucking,
I work,

1744
01:46:53.881 --> 01:46:58.740
I don't do cardio.
I got to steal my kids gave me this fitbit thing,
you know,

1745
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:02.610
it tells you how many calories and how many steps you take and what,

1746
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:07.080
which uh,
it's no different than a mirror.

1747
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:10.680
Uh,
you know,
cause that'll tell you whether you're fucking fat slob.

1748
01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:15.310
<v 5>But I wear a watch also,
which is weird.
Well,
they'll fit bits and I wear a watch.</v>

1749
01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:16.233
It's got a watch on it.

1750
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:19.930
<v 2>No,
no,
there's no watch on a fitbit.
Oh,
I thought there was no,
it was just,
it's,</v>

1751
01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:24.030
it's a bunch of different ones.
Oh,
they do have one jeweled watch.
Yeah.
So,

1752
01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:28.210
but I mean,
I,
I work out,
I lift in my hotel,
like I buy,

1753
01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.940
like if there's no workout room,
there's no workout room where I'm staying.

1754
01:47:30.941 --> 01:47:35.140
There's just cardio.
So I got shit I bought,
I got this one fucking day.

1755
01:47:35.141 --> 01:47:39.580
What's that?
Uh,
what's it called?
I one that you can put it in your door.

1756
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:43.690
Fucking do,
you know,
I do back and I'll do arms,
chest.

1757
01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.480
Then I also got a good tricep.

1758
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:48.830
<v 5>Well No,
I love how he can't just tell you he does backs and arm and chest.</v>

1759
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:53.300
He has to stand up and start mining the motions as if no one's ever done a lat

1760
01:47:53.301 --> 01:47:58.230
pull down before.
He's like I do back and I do buy,
I do chest,

1761
01:47:59.110 --> 01:48:00.920
give us a sign language.

1762
01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.470
<v 2>I like,
I'm a little animated today on the show.</v>

1763
01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:10.340
So I try to be fucking healthy.
I mean Bonnie and I,
Donny,

1764
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:12.970
what a fucking half of keeps me Benny.

1765
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:18.420
I say that's who I don't have friends.
So I talk about my wife.

1766
01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.590
Did your wife's cool?

1767
01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:23.820
What we should on New Year at one time we sit on New Year's Eve.

1768
01:48:23.850 --> 01:48:26.580
This one she ate meat.
Uh,

1769
01:48:26.581 --> 01:48:29.940
New Year's day we're going to go to KFC cause we probably haven't been here in

1770
01:48:29.941 --> 01:48:31.170
20 fucking years.
Tenure.

1771
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:36.590
So we went New Year's day and we ate there and our bodies couldn't fucking

1772
01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:40.890
handle it.
Really got so,
yeah,
it was,
it's so good.
But it just,

1773
01:48:40.891 --> 01:48:45.090
if you haven't eaten that,
the batter and all that stuff and all that stuff,

1774
01:48:45.091 --> 01:48:49.740
and I'm a pig,

1776
01:48:54.930 --> 01:48:59.930

1784
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:29.800
Do you even lift bro?

1785
01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:35.440
I,
here's the thing,
I have to lose 10 pounds for what?

1786
01:49:35.710 --> 01:49:39.070
You can't have dish many tattoos and not be ripped.

1787
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:43.750
Oh,

Actually he,

1790
01:49:52.890 --> 01:49:56.980
He's skinny.
Okay.
Well there's some fat guys that have awesome tattoos.

1791
01:49:57.130 --> 01:50:00.380
Dude from MTV.
Matt,
the Bald Guy,
but who looks cooler?

1792
01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:06.280
But I said,
I don't know who that is.
I said this on,
on a,

1793
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:08.260
on my podcast I want to do,

1794
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:12.880
I want to Hoshin outside comedy festival where I get to do it in my shirt off

1795
01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:15.280
outside.
You want to do comedy with your shirt off?

1796
01:50:15.281 --> 01:50:18.930
Do you think that'd be funnier that way?
It'd be cool.
Like a rock be cool.

1797
01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:22.590
It'd be like a fucking he come now.
No.
Okay.
Different rules.

1798
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:31.060
Whoo.
No,
no.
It doesn't enhance.

1799
01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.460
It doesn't,
it's having a six pack.
Does it enhance your comedy?

1800
01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:36.250
Probably takes away from it.
You know,
a

1801
01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:39.970
<v 2>guy can dream,
you know,
now it's just not a good dream.
Let it go.</v>

1802
01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:43.810
I hosted should Woodstock 99 did you really?
Yeah.
Fucking what was that like?
Oh,

1803
01:50:43.811 --> 01:50:48.370
she's fucking amazing.
How many bands?
I did three days.
Two or three stages.

1804
01:50:48.371 --> 01:50:52.490
So it was the east stage,
the maniacs to biggest limp biscuit.

1805
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:56.890
Then the west stage and then they had the alternative stage.

1806
01:50:57.310 --> 01:51:00.490
So I was on the West stage and it was like buck shower.
He was at my,

1807
01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.660
I had a fight with the lead singer on,
well,
I didn't know who I like,

1808
01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:08.450
it had just one trail.
We stayed in and a big part of the trailer,

1809
01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.330
which for the bands before they went on.

1810
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:15.440
Then I had just a little room with a chair.
So I walk into the room and um,

1811
01:51:15.690 --> 01:51:19.930
I have a cigarette.
I smoked at the time and some guys in my room,
he goes,

1812
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:23.320
can you put it out?
I go,
go fuck yourself.
This is my trailer.

1813
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:26.410
I didn't know who he was.
Right.
And he just huffed and puffed and walked out.

1814
01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:32.140
Then I realized when I saw him on stage,
he was the lead singer to punk Sherry.

1815
01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:35.440
I'm going,
this is the hottest,
best fucking band here.

1816
01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.640
These fucking guys are great.
Right,
right.

1817
01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:42.850
So I ended up buying a CD when I got home or did he never speak to you?

1818
01:51:42.851 --> 01:51:46.930
I never saw him again,
but I think he know I saw him that day.
I saw him at the,

1819
01:51:46.931 --> 01:51:51.730
uh,
at the food tent and he apologized.
He goes,
Hey,
I'm sorry for,

1820
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:55.510
you know,
size.
And I said,
I was too,
cause like,
you know,

1821
01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:59.860
I'm in recovery and you got to,
you know,
do I have,

1822
01:51:59.861 --> 01:52:03.370
I'm sorry I was an asshole.
I didn't know who you were.
And he said he was sorry.

1823
01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:07.870
But anyhow,
so I was bringing it up on my stage,

1824
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:13.640
uh,
who,
uh,
Mickey Hart playing the trumpet.

1825
01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.860
Metallica.
Megadeath uh,

1826
01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.370
you know,
this was 99.
Who else was on my stage?
It was just,

1827
01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:24.310
so you're doing standup too?
Well,
I'm just,

1828
01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:28.360
I'm just hosting it and I'll do some crowd work,
you know,
fuck around.

1829
01:52:28.361 --> 01:52:30.010
And you know,
at one point I had,

1830
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:34.660
there was maybe 50,000 and I had them all yell at one time.
I go,

1831
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:38.110
I want you to say hi to my kids so I can record it.
So I had them all,
y'all,

1832
01:52:38.111 --> 01:52:42.910
Hi Jessica Than Hi Ellen.
You know,
so I had that on tape.

1833
01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:47.100
Oh,
I had like 50,000 people yell,
Hi Jessica.
Hi.
Cool.

1834
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:50.330
And I got to tape at home.
And then it was,
you know,

1835
01:52:50.331 --> 01:52:54.830
go out some announcements and then you bring up some bands.
Some I did some,

1836
01:52:54.831 --> 01:52:57.170
you know,
they just came up.
Uh,

1837
01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:00.020
our mother piece was on my stage.

1838
01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:04.880
There was a bunch a ice ice cube was on my stage and uh,

1839
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.250
there was a lot of cool bands and Mickey Hart and plan and trunk,

1840
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:12.050
those fucking dudes killed.
Uh,
Bruce Hornsby was on my,
so they asked me Hornsby.

1841
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:13.183
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.310
Who's that old dude that's wavy gravy

1843
01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.510
money in the bank.

1844
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:35.240
Great.
If I remember,
wasn't Wavy Gravy,
just the guy,

1845
01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:39.020
but he was popular for doing so much acid back in the day.
Like can,
we were like,

1846
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:43.430
oh we got to do as much acid as this guy
is.
It's a big acid guy.

1847
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:47.540
Grateful favor and say,
hold on to my two little daughters.

1848
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:52.790
Get together Alan on the count of three one.

1849
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:01.603
That's cool.

1850
01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:07.060
Look at the size of the ants out there.

1851
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:11.780
Look at that.
What does that look at?

1852
01:54:11.781 --> 01:54:14.060
That it's always a weird thing when someone read,

1853
01:54:14.061 --> 01:54:18.700
does big cultural event like that?
Where'd you find you?
Like,

1854
01:54:18.701 --> 01:54:21.370
how did it get out of my closet?
I'm feeling good.

1855
01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:24.120
How was your a copy of that copy?

1856
01:54:25.710 --> 01:54:30.140
Are you guys having fun?
Your voice sounds so different.

1857
01:54:30.141 --> 01:54:34.610
Is that because you were smoking back then after three days?
Oh,
I see.

1858
01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.750
Was this the mud baby year with all the,

1859
01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:44.700
she was to fight fire with fire.
The main stage,

1860
01:54:44.701 --> 01:54:48.890
those are fire.
The last night they started riding because of a water and,
oh no,

1861
01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.550
the water.
What?
There was no water

1862
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.520
that I don't care.
What

1863
01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.780
<v 2>were you saying?
There was a fire.</v>

1864
01:54:57.781 --> 01:55:02.781
What don't you remember when they looked at fires over on the main stage?

1865
01:55:02.791 --> 01:55:07.260
The last day it got wild and they started like lighting fires,
but they were,

1866
01:55:07.261 --> 01:55:12.261
they were mad because there was no water for like $7 a piece and

1867
01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:16.830
there was no public water.
There was no like waterfowl in or anything like that.

1868
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:21.360
No,
it's a fucking in the field is,
there's outhouses that were disgusting.

1869
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:25.440
I mean I had a hotel room,
but uh,
how many fucking people there were?
Oh,

1870
01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:26.510
just fucking amazing.

1871
01:55:26.511 --> 01:55:31.511
You'd look if you look up to fires fired at 99 but that was the main stage.

1872
01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:37.250
And that stage brother Weise from Rochester and Tom Papa,

1873
01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:42.280
we're hosting that stage and they never got to really say anything because he's

1874
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:45.560
a radio bang guy up in Rochester.
Yeah.
Show.

1875
01:55:45.561 --> 01:55:49.010
They asked me do you want to do to eat each stage a main one?
I said,

1876
01:55:49.011 --> 01:55:50.870
no fucking way am I going there.
You know,

1877
01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.010
I didn't have in three days one thing thrown at me.
Okay.

1878
01:55:55.011 --> 01:55:58.820
Which is amazing at a fucking,
you know when there's that many people,

1879
01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.670
that's a pretty amazing,
those guys were having bottles strong.
Okay.

1880
01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:07.290
Because they were just so rowdy at that stage.
Limp Bizkit that stage had,

1881
01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.540
<v 0>so you were at a better stage.
Isn't it crazy that you were there?</v>

1882
01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.300
There's 50,000 people where you were and that's not even the big stage.
No,

1883
01:56:14.410 --> 01:56:15.280
that's insane.

1884
01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.270
<v 9>Wow.
Red Hot Chili peppers.
Yeah,
they weren't.
That was the thing,</v>

1885
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:23.720
<v 0>clay,
and this is probably not a good idea,
dude.</v>

1886
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:26.090
Just going to get us pool from youtube playing music.
Right?

1887
01:56:26.150 --> 01:56:28.190
Isn't that how it works?
It recognizes music.
Oh

1888
01:56:29.130 --> 01:56:33.820
<v 2>Shao I mean,
it was the coolest thing because,
uh,</v>

1889
01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.400
you know,
I had van,
you know,
we were taking,
we stayed in the casino,

1890
01:56:37.401 --> 01:56:42.080
the turning point and how to decide,
you know,
I met some hot girl.
I go,

1891
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:45.050
I got a place if you want to take a shower or something,
you know,

1892
01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:50.630

Uh,

1893
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:52.670
and I brought rd Fuqua with me.

1894
01:56:53.150 --> 01:56:56.240
Like I asked a bunch of people and they couldn't do it,
you know,
so odd.

1895
01:56:56.241 --> 01:56:58.070
He came already like,
he had a great timing.

1896
01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:01.810
We're eating and you know how you eat in a tent with all the free food and all

1897
01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:05.660
year,
I'm shitting next to fucking like major,
like corn.

1898
01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:07.281
And I'm just,

1899
01:57:07.281 --> 01:57:11.990
you're shooting with these fucking guys and online with them getting food.

1900
01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.910
You know,
I was in a,
in a van with a,
Ah,
I forget the band,

1901
01:57:16.911 --> 01:57:19.400
the lead singer to a band.
I never know.
I go,
what are you doing here?
He goes,

1902
01:57:19.401 --> 01:57:22.910
I'm in,
I'm playing.
I go name of the band.
And I had no clue what I want,

1903
01:57:22.911 --> 01:57:24.320
but there were fucking famous,

1904
01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:29.390
<v 0>well,
I'm glad you don't remember.
Again,
I know the story.
All the more awesome.
Or</v>

1905
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:35.530
I remember I met a guy who was famous,
Asco who you were,
he told me I forgot,

1906
01:57:35.531 --> 01:57:39.980
but he was famous.
I stink.
I have some good stories.
He's lucky.
Yes.

1907
01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.370
Fading a little.
We're about two hours and 15 minutes,

1908
01:57:42.371 --> 01:57:45.340
so I'm fucking juvenate Qa right now.
A little bit of a wall.

1909
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:48.340
Which doc thing was kind of fucking cool.

1910
01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:53.410
Well it was getting them all to say hi to your kids.
It's fucking awesome.

1911
01:57:53.411 --> 01:57:56.650
We can talk about the movie coming out.
Yeah,
that's what I want to talk about.

1912
01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:56.960
Yeah.

1913
01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:01.420
We want to talk about your movie called women aren't funny and it was you guys,

1914
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.400
you're motivated to do it,
uh,

1915
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:08.430
by the Christopher Hitchens famous thing that he wrote and actually did a video

1916
01:58:09.551 --> 01:58:13.100
about it as well.
Right?
I don't know.
You wrote in the Vanity Fair,
which is,
yeah,

1917
01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:14.170
he wrote it.

1918
01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:19.170
And then he also did a video where he described why women aren't funny because

1919
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:21.910
they don't need to be because men are pursuing them.

1920
01:58:21.911 --> 01:58:25.480
And the reason why men become funny is he gave us sort of an evolutionary

1921
01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:27.430
viewpoint of why women aren't,

1922
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:32.510
<v 2>it's a defense mechanism for men and times and it's an offensive mechanism to</v>

1923
01:58:32.511 --> 01:58:33.340
for men,
you know?

1924
01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:37.150
<v 0>Yeah.
She laid it gets you out of fights,
but obviously it's not correct.
I mean,</v>

1925
01:58:37.151 --> 01:58:41.440
we just watched him to Tasha Ligero destroy,
you know,
we watch Amy Schumer it,

1926
01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:42.190
there's a lot of funny

1927
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:46.270
<v 5>women.
Your wife is one of them.
Your wife is fucking hilarious.
Bonnie Mcfarlane,</v>

1928
01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:50.560
I've known her for 20 years at least I've known him for at least 20 years,

1929
01:58:50.561 --> 01:58:52.300
maybe more.
She's funny as shit.

1930
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:56.940
<v 10>Here's the trail,
but I want the eyes.
But with more like mechanics,</v>

1931
01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.740
I've heard women are almost as often as you're not planning.
That's in the shot.

1932
01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:05.600
Can you make me look something like that's not funny.

1933
01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:10.280
Funny.
Are you that for money to bed?

1934
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:16.080
Everybody's fine.
It doesn't matter if you're a nine or Brian on one day.

1935
01:59:16.081 --> 01:59:17.180
You want me to get in the mall?

1936
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:23.620
<v 5>Ah,
shit that she old trailer.
You've got to get to good trailer.
Okay.</v>

1937
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:28.090
Where was the iTunes?
Go to iTunes woman.
I'm funny.
And the trailer.
That was good.

1938
01:59:28.091 --> 01:59:32.820
Anyway,
so tell us about this movie and try to be,
um,
I mean you,

1939
01:59:32.821 --> 01:59:37.510
you,
you have this thing,
you set it up where you're doing these,
uh,

1940
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.230
you're doing standup and you're going on the road.

1941
01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:42.270
Then you're interviewing all these people as well while you're doing it.

1942
01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.790
<v 2>Well,
here it started Bonnie,
this was Bonnie.</v>

1943
01:59:44.791 --> 01:59:47.730
Bonnie wrote an article and checking magazine about women,

1944
01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:51.980
Kamiyah satire and a lot of women on how women's stink.

1945
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:53.460
And then it was all saying,
you know,

1946
01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:58.380
and then the Christopher Hitchens article came out and you know,

1947
01:59:58.710 --> 02:00:02.100
we had so much going on in our careers,
but then,
you know,
you know,
careers,

1948
02:00:02.101 --> 02:00:03.870
they go up and down.
It was a mall.
We said,
you know,

1949
02:00:03.871 --> 02:00:07.860
we've got a door on fucking project we've had fucking pilots to keep,

1950
02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:11.330
they're not getting picked up.
You know,
we did two,
I did three Po,

1951
02:00:11.331 --> 02:00:15.420
two Polish would hurt and me and Patricia did a pilot then for pilots weren't

1952
02:00:15.421 --> 02:00:19.950
picked up.
I'm going,
we've got to do our own fucking thing,
you know,
so she goes,

1953
02:00:19.951 --> 02:00:24.300
well let's make this movie woman you know about female comics,
you know,

1954
02:00:24.590 --> 02:00:28.260
show.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
and we had no,

1955
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:30.420
we didn't know what the fuck we were in a car.

1956
02:00:30.421 --> 02:00:33.720
We're thinking that these bitch set will be in the movie and we're not even

1957
02:00:33.721 --> 02:00:38.660
close to ever making a boat,
you know,
hey,
we'll do this,
we'll do that.

1958
02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:43.980
And then our first comic,
we got like one or two,
you know,

1959
02:00:43.981 --> 02:00:45.270
just like Cory Kahaney.

1960
02:00:45.630 --> 02:00:46.670
<v 5>Well what was the idea behind it?</v>

1961
02:00:46.671 --> 02:00:49.970
You were just going to interview different female subject

1962
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:55.210
<v 2>if we were going to interview him on that subject and also videotape us.</v>

1963
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:57.720
<v 5>Right.
And what was the,
what were you trying to achieve?</v>

1964
02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:00.730
<v 2>We are trying to achieve,
okay.</v>

1965
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:06.550
It's the question we are trying to make a funny movie because of a female to

1966
02:01:07.291 --> 02:01:11.500
making a funny movie or sheer answer.
Let him finish what you're saying.
Go ahead.

1967
02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:15.340
There's your answer.
Okay.
Because there's no a woman,

1968
02:01:15.341 --> 02:01:19.930
funny as a matter of fucking opinion,
but no one ever says,
you know,
uh,

1969
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:23.920
you know,
people will go up to women comics,
90% of time we go,
I don't,

1970
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:26.890
I hate women comics,
but you were funny,
you know,

1971
02:01:26.891 --> 02:01:30.130
no one ever goes up to a black comic goes,
look,
I hate black comics,

1972
02:01:30.131 --> 02:01:30.964
but you are fun.

1973
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:36.550
<v 5>That sounds exactly what the dollar would say,
but you know what I'm saying?</v>

1974
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.770
And,
and show her vision

1975
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:44.660
<v 2>was a lot to my vision was,
fuck,
I gotta get rejuvenate his career,</v>

1976
02:01:44.661 --> 02:01:48.280
getting a jumpstart it somehow,
you know,
besides what I was doing it,

1977
02:01:48.370 --> 02:01:51.620
I went a and putting out CDs and doing whatever teenagers objective was to show

1978
02:01:51.621 --> 02:01:55.040
that it's ridiculous so that when it was just so ridiculous fucking point and

1979
02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:59.780
Christopher Hitchens racist article and no body is,
you know,

1980
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:04.790
uh,
we challenge it,
challenge it or like a re re bottle,
whatever.
Right?
Yeah.
Okay.

1981
02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:08.240
Let's go,
let's see.
The,
the thing,
let's play it.
Here's the,
here's the new one.

1982
02:02:08.241 --> 02:02:09.230
Yeah.
Okay.

1983
02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:17.170
<v 10>Yeah,
it's recording.
Yes it is.
Do you think women are?</v>

1984
02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:22.090
There's more funny guys that I went to high school with or like mechanics.

1985
02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:27.240
I'm female comedian Bonnie Mcfarlane and I've heard women aren't funny almost as

1986
02:02:27.341 --> 02:02:30.880
often as you're not funny.
Kitchens blows my mind.
I mean I just think like,

1987
02:02:30.881 --> 02:02:32.770
can you imagine if someone was like,

1988
02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:37.400
are black people smart for Vanity Fair?
Like you,

1989
02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:41.410
you guys scoot all over the place and it just,
it gets spooked.
I don't know.

1990
02:02:41.411 --> 02:02:43.750
Whenever people are like sexist towards women,

1991
02:02:43.751 --> 02:02:48.751
I just get super racist towards black people become comedians because they were

1992
02:02:49.091 --> 02:02:52.320
molested as introvert recruit to me as a female leader.

1993
02:02:52.321 --> 02:02:55.930
But comedy is this,
get a job.

1994
02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.650
I can't do this anymore.
So many great actresses,

1995
02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:04.860
Richard Ready Actresses Richard have a great

1996
02:03:09.490 --> 02:03:13.810
guess what?
That was a male comics.
Come on,
let's go.
This is stupid.

1997
02:03:13.811 --> 02:03:16.300
Can I do something stupid?
What do you try it?

1998
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:18.910
It looks like you're doing a butter commercial or something.

1999
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:21.880
You were asking the right person cause I think a lot of guys and not that fine.

2000
02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:25.270
Everybody's fine.
It doesn't matter if you're a guy or girl,

2001
02:03:25.271 --> 02:03:29.890
are you have money to bed?
I am.
It's funny,

2002
02:03:30.370 --> 02:03:31.750
I'm not wearing any pants

2003
02:03:36.450 --> 02:03:39.690
<v 2>Larry.
This is Sarah does exactly what it shoots it.
She planned that on purpose.</v>

2004
02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:42.400
No,
actually what I was telling you,
which that wasn't a joke.
Oh.

2005
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:45.990
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.

2006
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.470
I need the big toe is longer but it's self.
The pick those longer after it.

2007
02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:51.930
But how funny.
That's what I was telling you to Diana.
Yeah.

2008
02:03:51.931 --> 02:03:56.310
I thought maybe that was a plant like watching that.
Oh I just so not at all.

2009
02:03:56.311 --> 02:04:00.540
It's just so funny.
Like show Bonnie,

2010
02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.740
you know Bonnie wanted to direct a movie.
You know she's fucking,

2011
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.580
she's had another level when it comes to writing a vision,
I'm telling you,

2012
02:04:09.150 --> 02:04:10.710
I've never seen anybody any like,

2013
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:14.430
she just did an article and they wanted to write five of our favorite male

2014
02:04:14.431 --> 02:04:16.830
comics,
but she didn't,

2015
02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:21.840
she wrote five but not why they're funny.
But why,
you know,

2016
02:04:21.841 --> 02:04:25.730
like I,
I told her to put Jelly d ice in it.
Like you'll see Joey,
eh,

2017
02:04:25.770 --> 02:04:30.770
but it was funny stuff cause her funny because I like him as a woman because he

2018
02:04:31.531 --> 02:04:34.470
seems like the kind of guy that will hold me,
you know what I mean?

2019
02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:38.070
So she just took it to a different perspective than

2020
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.400
<v 4>they asked her and they loved it so she,
her mind works.</v>

2021
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:45.270
So she had this vision for a movie and we started off,
you know,

2022
02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.820
interviewing whoever,
you know,
we got can,

2023
02:04:47.821 --> 02:04:49.470
we didn't know we got this cameraman here,

2024
02:04:49.471 --> 02:04:54.270
this cameraman there and no experience whatsoever.
None whatsoever.

2025
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:58.470
None whatsoever.
Dan,
we got,
I don't know if our,

2026
02:04:58.471 --> 02:05:03.030
for if our biggest,
first,
our first biggest guy,
we got Chris,
we got Chris Rock.

2027
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:05.340
I said,
Chris,
would you do you know?
He said,
yeah.

2028
02:05:05.341 --> 02:05:08.880
So we interviewed him at the cellar.
So once we got Chris,

2029
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:12.660
then we started getting,
we started getting other people,

2030
02:05:12.690 --> 02:05:15.200
you know what that video made me want to do,
made,

2031
02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:19.770
made me want to see you interviewed Dan Cook for like an hour and find out how

2032
02:05:19.771 --> 02:05:24.570
crazy he must be.
We think we did an interview on for like 45 minutes to an hour.

2033
02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:26.490
That was what the weirdest part of the video was.

2034
02:05:26.491 --> 02:05:27.930
I wanted him to elaborate a little what?

2035
02:05:27.931 --> 02:05:31.170
Everybody's funny that that's one of the craziest things anybody's ever said.

2036
02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:34.870
Whether it's an not every day,
all day.
You got to see what he says.
He after it.

2037
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:38.450
What does everybody want?
Funny.
What are you teasing me here?

2038
02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:43.220
People see your goddamn movie.
You don't have to leave a tease like that.
Oh,

2039
02:05:43.221 --> 02:05:46.880
and a doe and a,
they don't anymore.
Well,

2040
02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:51.530
women or I don't exactly remember.
He goes,
everybody's knife.

2041
02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:54.260
You know what I mean?
Oh,
that's what he thought.

2042
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:58.380
What he thought it out of context is that they all know exactly like he said.

2043
02:05:58.530 --> 02:06:03.260
Does he say that women aren't funny?
No.
He said in the beginning,
let me,
I can,

2044
02:06:03.261 --> 02:06:05.610
I don't remember.
Let's just end this.
Okay,
now hold on.

2045
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:09.040
What's the cause?
One day,

2046
02:06:09.230 --> 02:06:11.810
a cup of coffee or something and something happens and you two hours

2047
02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:16.520
all be fucking fine and you want to know

2048
02:06:18.130 --> 02:06:21.330
what's holding your hand the whole way.
And it was still very slippery road.

2049
02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.700
You guys are holding here.
First of all,

2050
02:06:23.701 --> 02:06:27.960
there's three of you fucking guys against me.
I'm done helping kind of,

2051
02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:32.850
and you're laughing.
Listen to me.
If it came down to what they got your back,
uh,

2052
02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:37.880
the bottom line is,
Dane said,
what?
He fucking said.
That's the bottom line.
Danes.

2053
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:42.090
He said,
boy,
that's a window.

2054
02:06:42.130 --> 02:06:47.010
Remember we take we fucking four years ago,
why would you know?

2055
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:51.930
I mean,
you're pitching it.
Can I move on?

2056
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.660
And people were going,
you got to do Rogan.
And now they're thinking,

2057
02:06:57.661 --> 02:06:58.500
I'm fucking bombing.

2058
02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:03.060
I had some really good lines and stories I've told about it was great.

2059
02:07:03.850 --> 02:07:08.480
Now we're not fucking around.
So he said,

2060
02:07:08.481 --> 02:07:10.760
I think,
what did he say?
Everything.

2061
02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:14.540
Everybody's funny till I started seeing some female comics,
I'm going,
Whoa,

2062
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:17.960
some of these girls aren't funny.
What she said.
Who was the,

2063
02:07:17.961 --> 02:07:20.120
which was the chick that said,
uh,
if,
uh,

2064
02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:24.230
like vanity fair writing a thing or black guy,
smart priest,
Chelsea Peretti,

2065
02:07:24.231 --> 02:07:28.770
Chelsea,
Chelsea,
she's fucking hilarious.
He kills you.
She does.

2066
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:32.990
She's killed.
Shot the movie.
So now we get Chris.

2067
02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:36.070
And so now we're starting to get other fucking,
you know,

2068
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.830
<v 2>we go,
hey,
you know,
can you do this?
Can you do this?
And you know,
Denny,</v>

2069
02:07:40.831 --> 02:07:44.800
after Chris,
we get,
you know,
uh,
uh,
joy bay,

2070
02:07:44.801 --> 02:07:47.260
harsh Susie Essman,
uh,
you know,

2071
02:07:47.261 --> 02:07:50.890
with don and Judy goal and Hickson's dies while you're doing this.
Hitchins die.

2072
02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:55.270
Did he have cancer while you guys were filming it?
We didn't know if he did.

2073
02:07:55.271 --> 02:07:58.030
We didn't know about it.
No,
because we filmed,

2074
02:07:58.330 --> 02:08:02.830
we started this project,
this August is seven years old.

2075
02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:08.190
It took us four years to film because we film for three years and then we went

2076
02:08:08.831 --> 02:08:12.640
into editing and then we went,
we sent it to somebody goes,

2077
02:08:12.641 --> 02:08:14.860
this is what you have to do to make this movie work.

2078
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:20.310
So we went and reshot then we got Adam Carolla after Hitchens and Hitchins sins

2079
02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.800
died.
And we got Adam Carolla.

2080
02:08:24.250 --> 02:08:29.140
And so we had another year of filming and then a couple of years of fucking

2081
02:08:29.570 --> 02:08:30.550
illegal with lawyers.

2082
02:08:30.551 --> 02:08:33.610
We went through three different lawyers pull out Christopher Hitchens,
right?

2083
02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:37.400
<v 0>Why women still aren't funny.
It's a video.</v>

2084
02:08:37.401 --> 02:08:40.130
It's from Vanity Fair.
And uh,

2085
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:44.510
he made a video about the same article that he wrote.
And the first,
the first,

2086
02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:48.530
the first comment is what a narrow minded,
frustrated,

2087
02:08:48.531 --> 02:08:51.470
misogynistic man.
And he's not even funny.

2088
02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:56.270
He obviously feels threatened by women and by his potential inability to get

2089
02:08:56.271 --> 02:09:00.380
laid,
which of course is the most important thing for evolution.

2090
02:09:01.190 --> 02:09:02.780
Also read this

2091
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:10.220
video,
Bro Video.
There's a video,
Brian.
Um,

2092
02:09:10.221 --> 02:09:15.110
so we can hear it instead of just showing it right.
Why women are still not,

2093
02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:20.120
yeah.
Why women still aren't funny.
It's on youtube.
It's kind of funny.

2094
02:09:20.150 --> 02:09:22.870
I mean,
it is funny.
It's,
it's interesting like the,
uh,

2095
02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:26.960
the whole argument is very interesting.
That argument about why women are funny,

2096
02:09:26.961 --> 02:09:30.050
why men are fun and you know,
it's like,
you don't know why anything is funny.

2097
02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:34.820
It's just funny.
There's people,
like perfect example is like I've always said,

2098
02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:37.970
Mitch Hedberg,
if you saw him,
Mitch Hedberg on writing,

2099
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.590
you would never think it's funny.
If you saw it on paper,
you'd like them.

2100
02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:44.220
What does that,
that's nonsense.
But it's funny.
She,
and why is it funny?
Cause he,

2101
02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:45.890
it was indefensible.
He was too funny.

2102
02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:49.850
<v 2>He was too smart.
Smart.
I mean,
he goes,
you have to,
I mean,</v>

2103
02:09:49.851 --> 02:09:52.750
he went after her Mother Teresa.
He,
you know,
he goes,
you have to,
well,

2104
02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:55.790
he covered all those bases with his essay too.
If you read the essay,

2105
02:09:55.791 --> 02:09:58.780
he's not saying it's impossible for women to be funny.
That's what Patrice says.

2106
02:09:58.781 --> 02:09:59.614
Yeah.

2107
02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:04.640
But we had Derosa we took it out and put them in the extras play fucking,

2108
02:10:04.641 --> 02:10:09.280
uh,
uh,
uh,
Hitchens for one scene,
you know,

2109
02:10:09.281 --> 02:10:13.820
and Derosa played Hitchens.
We have it in the,
at the end,
in the credits.

2110
02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:16.850
It's so fucking funny.
I bought him a corncob pipe and an ascot.

2111
02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.770
So he's sitting there with it.
But to Rosie came self,
he had not flood.

2112
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:24.470
He was doing the accent and he was going,
you know,
you're,

2113
02:10:24.471 --> 02:10:28.370
you're basically just what you're here to get fucked.
Okay.

2114
02:10:28.371 --> 02:10:32.430
That's why you're on the planet.
And it was so fucking funny is you get to that

2115
02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:33.980
<v 0>online.
Is that going to be</v>

2116
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.350
<v 2>a part of the iTunes version?
It's in the,
it's in the movie.
Yeah.</v>

2117
02:10:38.351 --> 02:10:42.160
It's when the credits are rolling.
Ah,
it's just a,
it's a row.

2118
02:10:42.161 --> 02:10:44.780
So it's not an extras.
It's just,
we didn't go around,

2119
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:48.910
so like I should run,
shall we got this,
you know,

2120
02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:51.530
we're starting to get bigger racks,
you know,

2121
02:10:51.550 --> 02:10:55.540
we can only come to la once or twice.
And when we came to La,
we got Sarah,

2122
02:10:55.910 --> 02:11:00.310
Wanda,
Todd glass and Maria Bamford.

2123
02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:05.170
And that was all we could get.
And at the time we turned down a battery goes,

2124
02:11:05.171 --> 02:11:06.790
you want Whitney Cummings?
So we don't know.

2125
02:11:06.791 --> 02:11:11.140
We didn't know who she was or like fucking idiots at the time.
She had no heat.

2126
02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:15.220
Isn't that incredible?
That was just a couple of years ago.
But,
so,

2127
02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.420
and then we'd go back to New York.
We get joy bay harsh,
Susie Essman.
Uh,

2128
02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:24.370
uh,
you know,
and some,
you know,
pretty decent Joan Rivers.
We get Joan.

2129
02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:28.360
When Joan was great,
she sat with Bonnie,
then we got Rita Rudner Rosie.

2130
02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:33.040
So then the illegal work,
you know,
and I went through three lawyers,

2131
02:11:33.041 --> 02:11:37.540
which it took a lot of time,
which was a nightmare.
And now it's fucking on.

2132
02:11:37.541 --> 02:11:41.590
And it's so,
it's so fucking funny.
We showed it in four festivals.

2133
02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.860
It killed in every fucking festival.

2134
02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:50.020
Bonnie took 60 hours of tape,
60 fucking hours,

2135
02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.790
transcribed everything,

2136
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:56.960
watch everything and turned it into a 80 minute movie.
Wow.
How long?

2137
02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.510
It took a couple of years.
I mean,
would the editors in all by herself and it,

2138
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:02.760
well,
no,
she,
yeah.

2139
02:12:02.770 --> 02:12:06.250
And then she would take it to the editor and s and sat on top of them.

2140
02:12:06.490 --> 02:12:07.600
And then our first editor,

2141
02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:11.260
we went to a new editor after that and had to re edited again.

2142
02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:13.840
We shot it on four different cameras.

2143
02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:18.640
So then we had to take her to post works and have it all synchronized,

2144
02:12:18.641 --> 02:12:23.590
whatever the technical term is to make it look like it's from one camera.

2145
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:24.850
So that you know,

2146
02:12:24.851 --> 02:12:29.851
took however long and another 15,000 real labor of love for you guys.

2147
02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:35.080
Yeah.
But,
and it's not about,
look,
the money's gone.
If I get money back,

2148
02:12:35.081 --> 02:12:39.160
it's found money,
but it's just we did it ourselves.
How many Cros to do?

2149
02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.460
If you had to guess?
I,
I'm not allowed to say.
Really?
Yeah,
she said don't say

2150
02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:48.570
<v 0>okay.
Sorry.
I asked.
Uh,
I'll tell you the way it looks like.
It looks awesome.</v>

2151
02:12:48.571 --> 02:12:51.960
You sent me a copy.
I haven't watched it,
but it's sitting at home on my,
uh,

2152
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:54.960
my area.
I haven't watched a DVD in about a year.

2153
02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.480
So this would be the first DVD that I watch.
Well,
you like,
you should know what,

2154
02:12:58.490 --> 02:13:02.040
do everybody in it.
That's why,
you know what I mean?
I'll just buy it on iTunes.

2155
02:13:02.041 --> 02:13:06.420
When's it going to be out?
It comes up for preorder now,
but it comes out Tuesday,

2156
02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:11.580
Tuesday to 26.
Okay,
so soon.
So next Tuesday.
Next Tuesday.

2157
02:13:11.581 --> 02:13:15.030
The 26 women aren't funny.
I'll make sure I get,

2158
02:13:15.031 --> 02:13:16.890
I'm going to definitely get it on iTunes in a matter of fact,

2159
02:13:16.891 --> 02:13:20.160
I'm not going to watch it until I get it because I'm on a one year streak with

2160
02:13:20.161 --> 02:13:21.660
no DVDs.
I don't want to break it.

2161
02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:25.980
I'm not totally on a one year street cause I still to put them in for my kids.

2162
02:13:26.010 --> 02:13:27.840
So I've actually used your DVD player.

2163
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.150
<v 2>I mean you could take that DVD if maybe you know at a Weinstein.</v>

2164
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:35.660
<v 0>No,
I don't know anybody.
I don't know anybody in show business.
I'm very down.</v>

2165
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:38.260
Come in here.
Nope,
nobody does.
I'm very happy.

2166
02:13:38.261 --> 02:13:42.850
I'm totally out of the acting filmmaking television show loop completely.

2167
02:13:42.851 --> 02:13:47.851
I might as well be working as an optometrist cause I'm not that smart.

2168
02:13:48.190 --> 02:13:51.790
I might as well be a mechanic.
Don't you interview them?
Don't take,
come in.

2169
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:53.770
I mean I though I'd have them in.
Sure.

2170
02:13:53.771 --> 02:13:58.771
I mean I don't know that you have like a fucking big fucking a great podcast.

2171
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:01.990
Does it?
I mean,
look,

2172
02:14:01.991 --> 02:14:04.990
I would love to have Harvey Weinstein on cause he's a bad motherfucker and I

2173
02:14:04.991 --> 02:14:06.250
think it'd be interesting to talk to them.

2174
02:14:06.251 --> 02:14:08.740
I mean the guy has been responsible for the greatest movies ever,

2175
02:14:08.741 --> 02:14:13.570
but I'm interested in whatever interesting people I can meet,

2176
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:17.110
whoever I can meet that I can have on and talk to about anything.

2177
02:14:17.110 --> 02:14:20.920
It doesn't have to be like a guy that's show business related at all.

2178
02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.890
Matter of fact,
a lot of times I prefer when it's not,
you know,

2179
02:14:23.891 --> 02:14:27.430
I preferred unique things.
So I,
I'm curious about a bunch of different shit.

2180
02:14:27.431 --> 02:14:29.740
I'm not that serious about movie making,
you know,

2181
02:14:29.770 --> 02:14:34.720
it's not that I like watching him watching more crack shorty.
Fuck yeah.

2182
02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:36.130
I love a good crack story.

2183
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:40.600
You weren't with Otto when there's the famous auto crack store where they picked

2184
02:14:40.601 --> 02:14:44.710
up this club owner's daughter and they took her into the city and auto stopped

2185
02:14:44.711 --> 02:14:49.090
off at some park to get crack and he smoked it in the car and everybody's

2186
02:14:49.091 --> 02:14:52.720
freaking out.
And uh,
they called them up.
They go,
oh,
what the fuck are you doing?

2187
02:14:52.721 --> 02:14:54.610
He goes,
what?
I thought the broad wanted a potty.

2188
02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:00.520
It's a famous story.
She's in the car with him and everybody was like,
well,

2189
02:15:00.521 --> 02:15:02.290
you're fucking smoking crack in the car.

2190
02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:04.440
<v 2>I'll tell you,
I'll tell you a good story.
You'll love this.</v>

2191
02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:07.200
I've tell it all the time and I feel bad for the guy,
but fuck it.

2192
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:10.200
<v 0>Okay.
So was the names to protect the,</v>

2193
02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.660
<v 2>I'll say the name,
it's,
you know,
fucking bow shade again.</v>

2194
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.860
Show I'm doing one night or me and bashed steel.
Frankie's a heroin.

2195
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:20.340
I love Frankie Frankie's a heroin addict and I'm a [inaudible] and I'm a

2196
02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:22.740
freebase adding.
So we're doing a one nighter.

2197
02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:27.310
We have to pick up this act in New York.
Right?
Uh,

2198
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:31.920
and he did,
he didn't come to the one night or with us and we'll drop him off.

2199
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:36.180
So we do the one nighter and we're taking them back to the Improv and we go a,

2200
02:15:36.181 --> 02:15:39.700
hold on,
we've got to make a couple stops first.
You know,

2201
02:15:39.701 --> 02:15:43.110
and it's just some little white kid.
So I go up to Spanish Harlem,

2202
02:15:43.111 --> 02:15:46.200
it's like 168th and Amsterdam.
Believe me,

2203
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:51.540
this is fucking not the area this kid has ever fucking seen in his life ever.

2204
02:15:51.730 --> 02:15:52.470
Right,
right.

2205
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:56.040
I think I was up here going up to a one time and I got out of the car,

2206
02:15:56.070 --> 02:15:59.100
I was with these other comics and this dude was chasing another deal with a

2207
02:15:59.101 --> 02:16:02.160
knife and they,
these comics go get back in the car and I go,
fuck,

2208
02:16:02.161 --> 02:16:04.680
he's not after me.
It's not my beef.
I don't give a fuck.

2209
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:06.930
And I went and it's so was that kind of area.

2210
02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.320
So we take the kid up there and then he goes,

2211
02:16:12.931 --> 02:16:16.590
can you fucking please drop me off at the Improv?
I cannot,
you know,

2212
02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:19.800
and we got one more stop and we go down to the,

2213
02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:23.550
to alphabet city and Frankie cops heroin.

2214
02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:26.610
Now the kids are fucking mess now.

2215
02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:31.000
Frankie's in the back seat shooting up right as I'm driving.

2216
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:35.380
Oh my God.
And the kid is a fucking,
he's going,
he's losing his fucking mind.

2217
02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:38.050
It's don't get me the fuck Outta here.
You know,

2218
02:16:38.051 --> 02:16:42.190
I just cop crack and Frankie shooting dope in the back seat and we drop him off.

2219
02:16:42.191 --> 02:16:45.940
And it was David Spade.
He just came to New York.

2220
02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:48.460
There's some average and layer.
He's from Arizona.

2221
02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:53.200
He's from Phoenix who said he had props.
He did prompts.
He didn't prompts,

2222
02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:56.950
he had prompts.
I mean I was doing it for me three years.

2223
02:16:56.951 --> 02:17:00.850
He was doing it for maybe one or two or maybe three.
We all stunk.

2224
02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:05.350
Frankie was decent.
He was framing was good.
Yeah.
And,

2225
02:17:05.610 --> 02:17:09.190
and,
and it was him.
It was just some little white kid.

2226
02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.920
And he was like,
get me the fuck Outta here.

2227
02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.240
And he's met enough in the backseat and I told the story a million times on

2228
02:17:16.241 --> 02:17:19.720
radio,
but I told it on cow head in Florida and uh,

2229
02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:21.730
didn't spade was on county.

2230
02:17:21.731 --> 02:17:25.570
It goes to any comics that were holding you like hot fucking Boston.

2231
02:17:25.650 --> 02:17:28.660
Bastiaan they fucking took me against my will.

2232
02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:33.310
<v 0>That's hilarious.
Well,
opie and Anthony was in my opinion,</v>

2233
02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:35.680
the best show ever for standup comics,

2234
02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:38.380
like the best show ever to have like a POW wow.

2235
02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:41.860
Because we would be on me and I've been on with you before with like how many

2236
02:17:41.861 --> 02:17:44.020
people we've been on like five,
six guys.

2237
02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:47.650
And it just becomes this crazy round table with everybody shooting the shit.

2238
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:52.980
And that's what encouraged me to do podcasts was doing ona.

2239
02:17:53.470 --> 02:17:55.090
I mean it was a bunch of things,

2240
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:58.600
but one of them was Anthony's live from the compound.
That was the biggest one.

2241
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.890
Uh,

2242
02:17:58.890 --> 02:18:02.230
seeing Anthony in front of that green screen when he first started doing that.

2243
02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:02.831
And I was like,

2244
02:18:02.831 --> 02:18:06.940
this fucking guy just created a set in his house and he's just doing his own

2245
02:18:06.941 --> 02:18:10.240
thing like on the Internet for a goof.
It was like on a lot.
What does it,

2246
02:18:10.470 --> 02:18:11.680
do you remember what he had it on?

2247
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:16.610
I think it was always on either Justin TV or some,
well that was us three.

2248
02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:19.840
It was something else.
It was like lives something.

2249
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:24.130
They still use it pow talk and no,
it wasn't pal talk,
but he was doing pal.

2250
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:26.770
Talk to,
cause the other thing about Anthony,
he was doing pal talk,

2251
02:18:26.771 --> 02:18:30.490
which is a lot like Ustream and they were doing it live from the studio so you

2252
02:18:30.491 --> 02:18:33.720
could see a video version of the show,
but then Tom Green off.

2253
02:18:33.721 --> 02:18:38.170
So when we went to his studio yet for that.
Yeah,
it's been tough.
Yeah.

2254
02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:42.550
Yeah.
Tom Green had a fucking full studio in his house.

2255
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:45.450
His house had been trapped,
but he really had done it like,

2256
02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:50.320
it wasn't a podcast.
It was,
he had a television show on the Internet,

2257
02:18:50.321 --> 02:18:53.710
but he was doing it like a television show and he had his own servers.

2258
02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:55.210
Like he had these wires,

2259
02:18:55.211 --> 02:18:59.920
he's like snake wires through the fucking house and he'd converted his entire

2260
02:18:59.921 --> 02:19:03.040
living room.
It's like the tonight show said it was really weird.

2261
02:19:03.041 --> 02:19:06.580
Camera's there and everything.
It was really fucking fun.
That was one of them.

2262
02:19:06.581 --> 02:19:07.414
That was a big one.

2263
02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:09.180
<v 2>Was it doing well?
Was it getting a,</v>

2264
02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:12.410
<v 0>it was a little ahead of its time.
He was really good at,</v>

2265
02:19:12.650 --> 02:19:15.710
he was really good at it,
but it was ahead of its time.
It was before,
you know,

2266
02:19:15.711 --> 02:19:18.410
if he had done that today it would be gigantic.
It does now.

2267
02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:22.240
Well he does it again,
right?
He's doing it in an access TV.
Right?
He's got a show,

2268
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:26.390
he's got an an actual TV show.
But um,
they,
you know,

2269
02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:28.280
when he was doing and uh,
Anthony

2270
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:28.581
<v 4>was doing,</v>

2271
02:19:28.581 --> 02:19:33.581
but then going on ONA and realizing like that ONA would just give you this free

2272
02:19:34.071 --> 02:19:36.710
form,
you know,
where everybody else had like a real structure.

2273
02:19:36.711 --> 02:19:38.360
Any other show that you did.
They had a real,

2274
02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:41.390
and they would never invite five comics to come in and just start brutalizing

2275
02:19:41.391 --> 02:19:43.970
each other on the air and take over the whole show.
But Ona,

2276
02:19:43.971 --> 02:19:46.460
we just sit back and let it all happen.
They would just,

2277
02:19:46.461 --> 02:19:49.640
they would direct the Q and Anthony's a good light was a great laugh for and

2278
02:19:49.641 --> 02:19:53.780
shows up.
But if Patrice was on a run,
like no one tried to stop it,

2279
02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:56.590
no one tried to get in the way of Patrice and Louie,
you know,

2280
02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:59.750
when people were on the run,
they were on the run.
And the thing about,

2281
02:19:59.751 --> 02:20:02.660
she like the differential between them and stern,

2282
02:20:02.661 --> 02:20:04.700
stern put you on and I've never touched her.

2283
02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:08.780
And Bonnie did a lunch and I'm not against,
it's just I'm in the O and a camp.

2284
02:20:08.781 --> 02:20:12.040
It's like you don't leave the Gambinos and go to the Colombo.

2285
02:20:12.350 --> 02:20:15.320
You know what I mean?
Even when they were off the air for two years,

2286
02:20:15.350 --> 02:20:19.370
I'm still with this family so I don't go over it,
you know,
so,

2287
02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.590
and he would put comics on during the news,
but ONA,
we'll put you on the whole.

2288
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:28.880
And they were smart because they're doing 20 hours of fucking radio a week

2289
02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:32.870
started.
They got comics on and other big guests,

2290
02:20:32.871 --> 02:20:36.290
but to comics are so fucking funny.
You know?

2291
02:20:36.410 --> 02:20:41.060
I mean they would,
they were very selective about their fucking comic.

2292
02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:43.340
I remember when I first came on,

2293
02:20:43.341 --> 02:20:47.640
they came to see me at Caroline's and both of them and I,

2294
02:20:47.641 --> 02:20:48.680
and I had a good set.

2295
02:20:48.681 --> 02:20:52.820
So they brought me on and it took me a couple times on until they go,
okay,

2296
02:20:52.821 --> 02:20:56.660
this guy,
you know,
whatever.
I brought Patrice in.

2297
02:20:56.661 --> 02:20:59.390
I was the first one to bring Patrice and so I've,
I go,

2298
02:20:59.391 --> 02:21:01.920
you got a sheet is fucking dude.
Yeah.
That's the thing about,
Oh hey,

2299
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:05.990
they'll let you bring guys in.
I brought in Ari,
I brought in Joey.
You know,

2300
02:21:05.991 --> 02:21:10.130
you could bring people in.
Yeah.
If date they'll take your word for the day.

2301
02:21:10.131 --> 02:21:13.600
Like you don't do anything because if they think you're trying to fucking

2302
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:17.900
disastrous results.
We've had guys bring in people and we're like,

2303
02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:20.000
what the fuck has gone on here?

2304
02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:23.990
So guys would bring their girlfriend with no fucking announcement whatsoever,

2305
02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:27.890
but fuck out while they're no microphone was on them.
Answer questions.

2306
02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:30.950
Remember that?
Oh,
when they would do events,
I mean,
you know,

2307
02:21:30.951 --> 02:21:35.951
they had any w days for fucking 50 gallon drum challenge and just fucking bitch.

2308
02:21:38.151 --> 02:21:42.920
I mean it was fucking,
you know,
could be almost on the verge of wacky radio.

2309
02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:44.140
But it was,
it was,

2310
02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:49.040
but it was to an edge up look when they did the homeless shop and spray,

2311
02:21:49.490 --> 02:21:51.290
do you know what that bit was?
You know,

2312
02:21:51.291 --> 02:21:53.870
they'd go to the mall and give these homes,
you know,

2313
02:21:53.871 --> 02:21:58.250
we would run when and give homeless people like 300 bucks to go.

2314
02:21:58.251 --> 02:22:03.251
And it was just a madhouse and it would go to Lake Livingston Mall and you know,

2315
02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:04.370
and,

2316
02:22:04.370 --> 02:22:08.460
and I would be with like two homeless guys and get play by play with my guys and

2317
02:22:08.461 --> 02:22:11.810
then their guy.
And it was just unbelievable.
I tried to talk,

2318
02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:16.820
my homeless guys are spending his whole 300 on one on and one Louis Vuitton.

2319
02:22:16.850 --> 02:22:17.683
Ty.

2320
02:22:19.170 --> 02:22:22.560
What was funny about them too is they didn't have to do just bits.
No.

2321
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.010
They can do anything they did.
They had wacky radio

2322
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:30.600
<v 5>gags.
But some of the best shows were just people hanging out.
Any,
listen,</v>

2323
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:35.580
I day fucking,
you know how we talked,
how great Jenny was.

2324
02:22:35.610 --> 02:22:38.460
Yeah.
This how great he was.
But they didn't give a fuck.

2325
02:22:38.670 --> 02:22:40.980
He came in the first time.
There's one,

2326
02:22:40.981 --> 02:22:44.460
they were in new and they wouldn't let him in studio.

2327
02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:47.720
They're gonna keep and they kept them at was a waiting room they had when they

2328
02:22:47.721 --> 02:22:50.600
were in a,
that had pinball machines on.
Right.
And they fuck with them.

2329
02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:54.540
What they made them do.
Yeah.
And He'd shut off.
He's fucking Richard,
Jenny,
but,

2330
02:22:54.541 --> 02:22:56.220
and they're fucking,
you know,

2331
02:22:56.221 --> 02:23:00.720
arrogant fucking hot fucking Radio Djs,
you know.
So there's,

2332
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:05.760
there's tons,
there's a lot of ego from both sides.
So,

2333
02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:09.720
you know,
and they're funny fucking radio and he's a great comic.

2334
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:13.260
So they had him out there.
There's pinball machines,
there's spirit,
whatever.

2335
02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:14.220
And they wouldn't let them in yet.

2336
02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:17.850
And they made him start off his interview through the window.
They call it,

2337
02:23:17.851 --> 02:23:21.630
they did a prison interview.
Like he had a talk through the window,

2338
02:23:22.170 --> 02:23:26.370
like it was a prison visit.
Oh,
that's so ridiculous that they would come back on.

2339
02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:29.160
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then I think they brought him in after that.

2340
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:31.680
There was one that came back on during the XM days.
Right.

2341
02:23:31.681 --> 02:23:35.880
Was it years later he came back on that,

2342
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.780
that guy hit me hard when that guy killed himself.
Yeah.
Yard.
That was,

2343
02:23:39.810 --> 02:23:43.400
that was one like,
whoa.
Oh,
well I just,

2344
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.890
because we knew him as a friend or no,
I didn't know him as a friend.

2345
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:49.590
I knew him as an acquaintance.
Like he was always friendly.

2346
02:23:49.770 --> 02:23:51.060
I had some conversations with them,

2347
02:23:51.310 --> 02:23:55.140
had a nice conversation with him on a plane just a little bit before he died.

2348
02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:58.920
He was sitting just by chance right in front of me and I was like,
what's up?

2349
02:23:58.921 --> 02:24:00.050
Rich was going on,
what are you doing?

2350
02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:01.950
He was out there doing some crazy corporate gig,
you know,

2351
02:24:01.951 --> 02:24:04.000
they would fly him out and give them like a hundred grand and he's,

2352
02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:08.130
he's ridiculous cakes and he was on his way doing that in the same town where I

2353
02:24:08.131 --> 02:24:11.430
was doing a club and we just talked a little bit and then,
you know,

2354
02:24:11.431 --> 02:24:16.190
a couple of weeks later I got the news and it was just,
that was hard for me,

2355
02:24:16.191 --> 02:24:19.830
man.
Yeah,
some of it was,
where's me?
When I,
when I first started,

2356
02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:22.970
that guy was like a huge influence and a,

2357
02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:26.460
I got to see him one time before I ever paid to see standup.

2358
02:24:26.461 --> 02:24:29.550
I remember he just murdered,
did it catch and Cambridge,

2359
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:32.310
he was at catch a rising star in Cambridge and I went down to see him as,

2360
02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:36.330
he just fucking destroyed it.
He was machine gun.
It was so funny,

2361
02:24:36.690 --> 02:24:37.620
so good too.

2362
02:24:38.010 --> 02:24:40.360
I remember just sitting there and I was sitting in the front row and I was just

2363
02:24:40.361 --> 02:24:43.680
saying,
I'm like,
God damn like this.
I knew,

2364
02:24:43.950 --> 02:24:46.200
I knew I was seeing something special,
you know?

2365
02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:49.740
I mean I hadn't done comedy and I was thinking about doing it and I knew when I

2366
02:24:49.741 --> 02:24:52.800
saw him I was like,
wow,
this is,
I'm just so lucky that I could see this.

2367
02:24:52.801 --> 02:24:54.540
Cause I'd seen him on television before,

2368
02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:58.200
so I'm on the tonight show and I'd seen him I think on an HBO special or

2369
02:24:58.201 --> 02:25:01.500
something like that.
But to see him live like,
uh,
at,

2370
02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:04.380
at the comment at catch a rising star,

2371
02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:08.160
it was also just an amazing time for comedy,
you know,

2372
02:25:08.161 --> 02:25:11.160
because it was the time of the original Hbo Comedy Specials.

2373
02:25:11.161 --> 02:25:12.510
They really didn't exist before that.

2374
02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:17.720
There was like a series of started happening and those comedy specials gave

2375
02:25:18.031 --> 02:25:19.050
birth,
those,

2376
02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:22.410
those and the evening at the Improv and all those other shows gave birth to all

2377
02:25:22.411 --> 02:25:24.010
these great that came up.

2378
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.190
<v 4>And then all these comedy clubs because Steven Wright made it out of Boston.</v>

2379
02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:29.170
Like,
did you ever see when standups stood out?

2380
02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:34.650
I'll make France Alamedo documentary.
It's about Boston.
It's amazing.

2381
02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:36.251
Amazing.

2382
02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:40.930
Talking me about that and it details when Steven Wright made it and when Steven

2383
02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:44.770
Wright made it,
everybody sort of freaked out and realize,
oh my God,
like not,

2384
02:25:44.771 --> 02:25:47.830
we're not just trying to be funny,
which is what everybody was before.

2385
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:50.650
We're trying to make it and it changed the whole scene.

2386
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:51.880
Let's scene kind of got weird.

2387
02:25:52.270 --> 02:25:55.210
Whereas before that it was all just a bunch of men,

2388
02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:00.300
savage men like Knox and like fucking Lenny Clarke and dawn Gavin and they were

2389
02:26:00.341 --> 02:26:04.810
getting hammered doing blow and fucking Taryn,
Taryn stages apart,

2390
02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:08.670
all cross the town crazy.
And it was so many clubs up care.
You were so mad.

2391
02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.830
I'd fucking one block.
There was five,

2392
02:26:10.850 --> 02:26:15.850
six duck Shoup comedy connection and there was another one comedy club that

2393
02:26:16.101 --> 02:26:18.850
Charles Play House,
which is upstairs.
It was in insane.

2394
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.060
I remember working niche doing seven shows in one night upstairs,

2395
02:26:22.061 --> 02:26:25.390
downstairs to upstairs.
Downstairs.
It mix had three rooms.

2396
02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:30.370
There was three simultaneous shows going on at all times.
It was insane.
Then,

2397
02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:32.550
you know,
let me tell you,

2398
02:26:32.551 --> 02:26:37.290
you know who else I like Jenny,
but fucking dom,

2399
02:26:37.291 --> 02:26:40.980
I rarer,
rarer as a murderer.
He's a fucking,
I I'd want,

2400
02:26:40.990 --> 02:26:43.810
I stopped and cal and once it was just,
I mean,
I've worked with him.

2401
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:46.390
We did a private event,
but it was,

2402
02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:49.030
I might've left after my spot because I went on and it was,

2403
02:26:49.450 --> 02:26:52.210
but then I was at college when I stopped and I'm watching him for like 15

2404
02:26:52.211 --> 02:26:53.890
minutes because I don't watch comics a lot.

2405
02:26:53.891 --> 02:26:57.760
I try not to watch too many comics because I don't want to pick up anything.

2406
02:26:57.761 --> 02:27:01.270
I don't want to because I'll ad Lib,
you know,
so they gotta it's gotta be,

2407
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:05.690
you know what I mean?
For me to watch a comic,
uh,
you know,
Patrice,

2408
02:27:05.691 --> 02:27:09.460
I would always watch and I'd watch in a second,

2409
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:13.420

but I was watching dom and I'm going,

2410

he's one of the funniest people alive.

2411
02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:21.200
You can't get any fucking funnier than this guy.
He just pow,

2430
02:28:25.671 --> 02:28:29.630

it was fun to hang out.
He comics and have club owners lie to your face.

here's the thing,
I sell tickets.
You're a fucking great thank you.

2436
02:28:48.031 --> 02:28:49.970
Been doing comedy a long time.
We're almost out of time.

2437
02:28:49.971 --> 02:28:52.270
We have five minutes left.
Certain errors I shall take you shorted.

2438
02:28:52.271 --> 02:28:55.990
I know my problem was after last comic I was selling out everywhere.
Right,

2439
02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:58.550
but that audience,

2440
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.030
what they saw me doing TV and when did they show me doing clubs are two

2441
02:29:02.031 --> 02:29:06.640
different things because it was a sweet telecine watered down,

2442
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:08.600
watered down and now all of a sudden you're at the club.

2443
02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.310
So and plus I had a reputation as the east coast.
He's right.

2444
02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:14.960
So I toned it down a lot,
you know,

2445
02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:19.610
and less crowd work and more material and whatever.
I listen,

2446
02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:21.500
I do what I,
what I need to do,

2447
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:25.550
but it selling certain eras,

2448
02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:28.370
I pack them out with something.
We'll call this movie,
who knows?

2449
02:29:28.371 --> 02:29:33.170
Next thing you know,
doing theaters.
Again,
it goes up and down.

2450
02:29:33.470 --> 02:29:36.080
But what one thing I always do is I always keep writing.

2451
02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:38.270
I got my four CD coming out.

2452
02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:43.190
I always keep fucking writing and whether I'm working a fucking beat club,

2453
02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.090
see club,
a club,
it doesn't matter to me.
I'm still doing what I fucking do.

2454
02:29:47.091 --> 02:29:50.780
His comedy.
That's why I like to do,
I love doing it so I don't give a fuck,

2455
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:54.130
you know?
I don't know.
I fucking love comedy.
I God damn man.
I'm,

2456
02:29:54.131 --> 02:29:57.270
I'm looking at him.
My first honeymoon,
I did comedy.
Good for you.
I know.

2457
02:29:57.271 --> 02:29:58.070
We really,
yeah.

2458
02:29:58.070 --> 02:30:02.090
We went to San Francisco and I did a weekend at the holy cities to the club was

2459
02:30:02.091 --> 02:30:05.270
this fucking big school man that is an old school plays.

2460
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:07.970
A lot of guys started out in that spot,
right?
Yeah.

2461
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:11.090
That was like the heart of the San Francisco comedy scene.
What year was that?

2462
02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:16.550
I was my oldest daughter's 24 so it was about probably 25 years ago.

2463
02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:20.800
Ah.
I said,
I'm in San Francisco.
I might as well fucking,
yeah,
that's all.

2464
02:30:20.810 --> 02:30:23.870
I never got to do that place.
I got to do the old cobb's,

2465
02:30:24.170 --> 02:30:28.700
the old jobs and it was tiny when it was like 140 seats or something like that.

2466
02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:33.290
She,
this was awesome.
There's clubs that we'll use,
but it's all about like,

2467
02:30:33.291 --> 02:30:34.760
I had a club one said,
well,

2468
02:30:34.761 --> 02:30:38.000
he did too much crowd work while it was Halloween fucking weekend and they were

2469
02:30:38.001 --> 02:30:40.180
wearing costumes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2470
02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:42.830
I'm not going to talk to the white guy in black face.
Really?

2471
02:30:42.831 --> 02:30:46.370
I'm not going to do 10 minutes on his care if it's crowded.
As long as it's fun.

2472
02:30:46.371 --> 02:30:49.880
It's funny if Sony who she cares.
Listen,
if you're selling out to club,

2473
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:53.990
they don't give a fuck.
If you like the wait staff on fire,
they don't care.

2474
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:56.570
All they care about is numbers.
Right.
Then again,

2475
02:30:56.571 --> 02:31:01.220
you'll get some a mom and pop clubs to care.
You know,
I listen,
I keep busy.
I do.

2476
02:31:01.221 --> 02:31:05.330
I write,
fucking got a movie fucking coming out.
Uh,
you know,
a sheet.

2477
02:31:05.450 --> 02:31:09.680
What the fuck?
Relax,
Bro.
I'm very like,
great.

2478
02:31:09.681 --> 02:31:12.740
You're fine.
It's beautiful.
I don't want to see somebody worked up.

2479
02:31:12.770 --> 02:31:17.000
Don't ask me about numbers aren't funny.
It's available on Tuesday the 26th.

2480
02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:20.190

2481
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:23.220

2482
