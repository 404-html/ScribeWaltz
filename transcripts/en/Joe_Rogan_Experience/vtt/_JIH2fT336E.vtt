9
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how to shut the noise off cause I'm a simple man and the only</v>

10
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 2>knows how to you use a Macintosh.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is my first time using windows since I was a small child.</v>

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.520

<v Speaker 2>just recently started using these alien where computers,</v>

23
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.830

24
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.350
<v Speaker 2>sponsor a lot of MMA fighters and I thought it would be cool to a,</v>

25
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>to use their products.</v>

71
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:51.341

76
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.341
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

77
00:01:57.341 --> 00:01:57.780

<v Speaker 2>it can make this a mutually beneficial situation.</v>

79
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:00.844
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

80
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 2>And I'll give you a full details on how would I think about this thing.</v>

81
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:03.911
<v Speaker 2>My friend,</v>

82
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Voodoo chicken has one of these.</v>

83
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.631
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

84
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.461
<v Speaker 2>he swears by it.</v>

86
00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 2>He loves that.</v>

87
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to buy a laptop and you want it to have some balls,</v>

88
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely the way to go.</v>

89
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean like you're not going to fucking go get a compact or you know,</v>

90
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 3>is this my past top?</v>

91
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.721
<v Speaker 3>It's a desktop.</v>

92
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:16.554
<v Speaker 3>You can carry route.</v>

93
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

94
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 3>But you fucking carried her out bitch.</v>

95
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.881
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

96
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need everything so light,</v>

97
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.461
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

98
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what a backpack is?</v>

99
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 3>You throw a backpack on and then he could take the laptop with me.</v>

101
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.141
<v Speaker 3>You Fuck?</v>

102
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the lady at Starbucks?</v>

103
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.751
<v Speaker 3>It's usually a lady.</v>

104
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I've only seen it in two different ladies who bring their whole entire tower to</v>

105
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 3>the computer.</v>

106
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's this woman that always brings,</v>

107
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 3>she has a tower,</v>

108
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.461
<v Speaker 3>a step,</v>

109
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 3>something like a 17 inch monitor.</v>

110
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.831
<v Speaker 3>She has,</v>

111
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

112
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 3>her power brick.</v>

113
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 3>She has a keyboard and mouse and she sets up like her office and he just works</v>

114
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 3>there for four hours.</v>

115
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:47.281
<v Speaker 3>Five hours.</v>

116
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:47.791
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

117
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Do poor people do that because it's the internet.</v>

118
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just because it's not a laptop.</v>

119
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you get free internet?</v>

120
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

121
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 3>and when you go to Starbucks,</v>

122
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 3>you get free Internet.</v>

123
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 3>So maybe that's why a lot of people are working there.</v>

124
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 3>They just can't afford internet.</v>

125
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Tough Times.</v>

126
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

127
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 2>just imagine the process of having to do this every day.</v>

128
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.221
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

129
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>it's for a poor person though,</v>

130
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 2>that can't afford the Internet.</v>

131
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a good deal.</v>

132
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 2>What does,</v>

133
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>what is good internet costs?</v>

134
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Like 50 bucks a month or so?</v>

135
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.161
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

136
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Because nowadays you can get fucking like your DSL for like $10 a month.</v>

137
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.901
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

138
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 2>If you got to cut you back,</v>

139
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>you've got to cut back two times are tough.</v>

140
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 2>And she's in the middle of writing the great American supreme screenplay.</v>

141
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:22.511
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

142
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

143
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>The greatest movie ever.</v>

144
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>It's about vampires who make love to women and become aliens.</v>

145
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to be like.</v>

146
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to add aliens to the mix.</v>

148
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Our sponsors for this fucking ridiculous show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

158
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like God damn solid product kits.</v>

159
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:46.511
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't say too many.</v>

160
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>God Damn was already pretty much used them up for the show bananas.</v>

161
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the fleshlight and enter in</v>

162
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:54.910

<v Speaker 2>you will save yourself 15% off the number one sex toy for men.</v>

164
00:03:59.351 --> 00:03:59.981
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

165
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>it's a God damn solid product.</v>

166
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

167
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.741
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

168
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:03.491
<v Speaker 2>it's embarrassing.</v>

169
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 2>But be a,</v>

170
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:04.674
<v Speaker 2>be a man,</v>

171
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.111
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

172
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.220
<v Speaker 2>The fuck up and go fuck one of those things that's really,</v>

173
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.691
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

174
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 2>try it without the plastic case.</v>

175
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Once in a while it's totally different because you getting them really squeezed.</v>

176
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>They're rubber and have like a really tight,</v>

177
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>so you do it without the plastic gets in a while.</v>

178
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.164
<v Speaker 2>It's a little different.</v>

179
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically tricking yourself off with the snake.</v>

180
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

181
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 2>it's just like grabbing your dig,</v>

182
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>but with rubber in between it so you don't feel your hand on your Dick.</v>

183
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's a little different.</v>

184
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:26.884
<v Speaker 2>Try it out.</v>

185
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 2>It's called fish out of the bucket and fish out of the bucket.</v>

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

201
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 2>including the best quality kettle bells available there.</v>

202
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 2>They're these York kettle bells.</v>

203
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.080
<v Speaker 2>We're selling them as cheap as possible.</v>

204
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

205
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

206
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole thing like collecting this and selling,</v>

207
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 2>selling kettle bells and shipping them.</v>

208
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge can't of a pain the ass.</v>

209
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 2>You're basically sending cannon balls through the fucking mail.</v>

210
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

211
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>they're ridiculous.</v>

212
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

213
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 2>it's this cheap as we can sell them folks,</v>

215
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but it is the best quality and they will last forever.</v>

216
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>These things are solid iron and it is an amazing workout.</v>

217
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>It is the only workout that I do now as far as lifting weights,</v>

218
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 2>all I do,</v>

219
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I do kettle bells,</v>

220
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 2>I do body weight squats and I do chin ups.</v>

221
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

222
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 2>that's all I do every,</v>

223
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>almost every exercise because I'm interested in functional strength.</v>

224
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in the leg strength that I can use for Jujitsu.</v>

225
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And for me it turned out that like when I lifted weights,</v>

226
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>like doing curls and bench press and stuff,</v>

227
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly helped because I was stronger.</v>

228
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't make you use your body athletically,</v>

229
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>use your body as one big unit.</v>

230
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's what kettlebells do.</v>

231
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Kettlebells are like full body exercises.</v>

232
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>You're out and it's it in play in the real</v>

233
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.251
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

234
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Like I bought a bag of dog food the other day and uh,</v>

235
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 4>it was a couple bags and they were under a bunch of cat litter fucking things.</v>

236
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

237
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

238
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 4>you go to Petco and you've got to like reach up and pull.</v>

239
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 4>That thing is at the bottom.</v>

240
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 4>I snatched that bitch up in the air 50 pound bag and that lady was like,</v>

241
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.291
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

242
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 4>you're so strong.</v>

243
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.061
<v Speaker 4>And I flexed,</v>

244
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't want kettlebells.</v>

245
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.884
<v Speaker 4>Yo.</v>

246
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 4>I would've said kettlebells bitch,</v>

247
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know her that well and I didn't want it to be all,</v>

248
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

249
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 4>think I was aggressive.</v>

250
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 4>But if you're interested in working out and getting in shape,</v>

251
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.450
<v Speaker 4>it is the best way we dude,</v>

252
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 4>we made them as cheapest humanly fucking possible.</v>

253
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.853
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

254
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 4>well that's my whole,</v>

255
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 4>my whole purpose for all this stuff is to give everybody the best shit we can</v>

256
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 4>sell,</v>

257
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 4>sell it at the lowest possible rate with and make it as clean and as easy as</v>

258
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

259
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Like if you buy supplements from us,</v>

260
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>

261
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.011
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

262
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 4>the big one is the cognitive supplement Alpha brain,</v>

263
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 4>which I 100% fucking swear by.</v>

264
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

265
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 4>you can talk with Cbo all day,</v>

266
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 4>but there's plenty of information available online about the efficacy.</v>

267
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 4>Make me what you use.</v>

268
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:05.411
<v Speaker 4>Big words of supplements and nutrition as far as like enhancing your,</v>

269
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 4>your brain's ability to function.</v>

270
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 4>People with Alzheimer's,</v>

271
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 4>they actually give them certain nootropics in order to stimulate their brain and</v>

272
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 4>they keep it functioning.</v>

273
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Our whole body relies on nutrients.</v>

274
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 4>You need nutrients for everything,</v>

275
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:18.921
<v Speaker 4>for every,</v>

276
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 4>every cell of your body.</v>

277
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 4>And what these are,</v>

278
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 4>is the best,</v>

279
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 4>most concentrated,</v>

280
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 4>purest form of supplements that we can sell you.</v>

281
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 4>And if you try this shit and he don't like it,</v>

282
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 4>you get 100% of your money back guarantee and your first 30 pills,</v>

283
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 4>you don't even have to return the pills.</v>

284
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm so concerned with making sure that people don't feel ripped off.</v>

285
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to make people happy.</v>

286
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 4>There's always gonna be someone that's a cunt.</v>

287
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:48.010
<v Speaker 4>And I try to limit the cont factor as much as humanly possible and that way we</v>

288
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:48.651
<v Speaker 4>have it set up.</v>

289
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 4>So anything you buy from on it,</v>

290
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.420

344
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>

345
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.320
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

346
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.300
<v Speaker 4>you swing these heavy ass ropes.</v>

347
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

348
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.180
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

349
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

350
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 4>And when you're doing it,</v>

351
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.520
<v Speaker 4>like go to one where you can see him like in the middle of an exercise.</v>

352
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Like here's what you're swinging these giant 40 pound ropes and dude,</v>

353
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 4>you get fucking winded.</v>

354
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like a constant wrestling match with an animal.</v>

355
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 4>That's wild.</v>

356
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

357
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.580
<v Speaker 4>It's weird because the weight on a giant rope when you're moving you like you've</v>

358
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 4>got to swing it up in the air and the weight's kind of funky.</v>

359
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.451
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

360
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

361
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 4>it's all awkward and Shit.</v>

362
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

363
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:51.931
<v Speaker 4>Wobbles.</v>

364
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:52.511
<v Speaker 4>You're holding it.</v>

365
00:09:52.511 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

366
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 4>you've got to really grab it so your grip gets amazing.</v>

367
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things that I've found since I started using kettlebells.</v>

368
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 4>My grip for Jujitsu is way better than it's ever been before.</v>

369
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Just just kettlebells and Chin ups.</v>

370
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.370
<v Speaker 4>And another thing we're going to get into soon,</v>

371
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 4>it's club bells,</v>

372
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 4>club bells or another amazing exercise.</v>

373
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.171
<v Speaker 4>Not that kind of bells,</v>

374
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

375
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:10.921
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

376
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:13.820
<v Speaker 4>they're an an ancient Indian form of a,</v>

377
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 4>of working out.</v>

378
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Do I use a 15 pound one?</v>

379
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

380
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.890
<v Speaker 4>that's how hard these extras are.</v>

381
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a 15 pound club bell,</v>

382
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.541
<v Speaker 4>15 pounds.</v>

383
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.321
<v Speaker 4>I'm a manly man.</v>

384
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>

385
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for me to admit that 15 pounds is actually a workout,</v>

386
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 4>but that's how bad ass these ours,</v>

387
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 4>these exercises are.</v>

388
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.581
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

389
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

390
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 4>the 35 pound kettle bell workout that will kick your fucking ass.</v>

391
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 4>And I know you like,</v>

392
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I can't work out with a 35 pound weight.</v>

393
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 4>What kind of a girly man am I?</v>

394
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 4>But I'm telling you this as a kettlebell extreme cardio workout and you can get</v>

395
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:43.970

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 4>the company's called dragon door.</v>

398
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.231
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

399
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even doing my commercials.</v>

400
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm hooking people up for free.</v>

401
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.063
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

402
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even affiliated with these bitches,</v>

403
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

404
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.671
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

405
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 4>but they have two of them.</v>

406
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:55.930
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

407
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 4>he's done two of these workouts and they're fucking incredible.</v>

408
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:02.610
<v Speaker 4>They kick your ass and all you need is one kettle bell and we're eventually</v>

409
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 4>going to have a bunch of different videos that are going to be available for</v>

410
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 4>download on on at.com as well.</v>

411
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 4>We're going to produce them some workouts for people so that you can just press</v>

412
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:13.190
<v Speaker 4>play and follow along through that.</v>

413
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what I like to do.</v>

414
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like that extreme kettlebell cardio workout because you just press</v>

415
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 4>play and he works out with you and you just,</v>

416
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 4>you just follow what he does and it's Bruno.</v>

417
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.830
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have to be in your house and creeping you out.</v>

418
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be weird looking at your dog and should get becoming friends</v>

419
00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:29.330
<v Speaker 3>with your wife,</v>

420
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.530
<v Speaker 3>giving you kissy faces,</v>

421
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.120
<v Speaker 3>send a text message to your kids.</v>

422
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.871
<v Speaker 3>I like white wine.</v>

423
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Cold thing to note is that the prices are insane on the kettle bells because I</v>

424
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:40.100
<v Speaker 3>was just at target looking at just us single kettlebell and you have like this</v>

425
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:42.680
<v Speaker 3>thing called the starter pack that comes with three kettle bells.</v>

426
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.000
<v Speaker 3>It governs with a a I believe a 35 uh,</v>

427
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 3>or a 25 if fifth in two fifteens or something like that.</v>

428
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what it is.</v>

429
00:11:51.381 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>But you can pull these different combinations.</v>

430
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

431
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:54.450
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

432
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a few different combinations.</v>

433
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 2>There's so it's like it's set up for someone who's like a serious athlete to</v>

434
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 2>someone who is just,</v>

435
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 2>a small girl who wants to learn some strength and it's one of the,</v>

437
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:07.571
<v Speaker 2>for women too,</v>

438
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:08.381
<v Speaker 2>it's not just for men.</v>

439
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:09.101
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking amazing.</v>

440
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It just things like Turkish getups I'm telling you,</v>

441
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like you think like to work out you have to do like,</v>

442
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.590
<v Speaker 2>you know like bench press or you have to do curls or,</v>

443
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is something called the Turkish getup where you just,</v>

444
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>you have this little weight,</v>

445
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 2>you put it in your hand and you just practice getting up,</v>

446
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 2>just getting up in a controlled way and extending your arm up in the air.</v>

447
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

448
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you can watch videos of it.</v>

449
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a hundred different videos explaining how to do it online,</v>

450
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's an amazing workout and it's great for core strength,</v>

451
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 2>functional strength,</v>

452
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:42.160
<v Speaker 2>strength that you would actually use in real life if you had a choke a bitch.</v>

453
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 2>It's good idea that the package it like that.</v>

454
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.220
<v Speaker 2>That was cheaper than a single tea kettle bell.</v>

455
00:12:46.221 --> 00:12:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Dot Target.</v>

456
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I see like that one.</v>

<v Speaker 5>my man.</v>

492
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.310
<v Speaker 5>We actually do have alien and</v>

493
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>where computers in respect for you,</v>

494

<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

497
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>The whole alien community must be like really excited about your show.</v>

498
00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Like people that sell alien ship.</v>

499
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

500
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're a fan of like ancient aliens,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Testing.</v>

511
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Testing.</v>

512

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

513

<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

514
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Well I was just in Roswell for the first time,</v>

515
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.700
<v Speaker 2>my life and that's impossible.</v>

516
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought you'd been there a hundred times already.</v>

517
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.850
<v Speaker 2>No snooping around.</v>

518
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

519
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

520
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.400
<v Speaker 2>He tell people who don't know.</v>

521
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

522
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:14.820
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

523
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.530
<v Speaker 2>what the reason for what Roswell,</v>

524
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:16.720
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

525
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a few people out there don't understand the story well in Roswell</v>

526
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:25.070
<v Speaker 2>allegedly there was a Ufo crash or some type of a crash in 1946 1947 and the</v>

527
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.240
<v Speaker 2>next day when the newspaper reported something,</v>

528
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.300
<v Speaker 2>they said that a flying saucer,</v>

529
00:14:33.301 --> 00:14:37.620
<v Speaker 2>a flying disc had crashed there with the potential of,</v>

530
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.300
<v Speaker 2>one living body.</v>

532
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Out of the three and a three days later there was a retraction of that story</v>

533
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.120
<v Speaker 2>where the government then told the Roswell newspaper,</v>

534
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 2>there you have to print a story that flying saucer</v>

535
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 6>crashed but a weather balloon and it was the only military testing that's the</v>

536
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 6>bay,</v>

537
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 6>basically the Roswell Story.</v>

538
00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.361
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

539
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 6>and ever since Roswell happened over the next 10 15 years,</v>

540
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.700
<v Speaker 6>our technological development in on earth basically snowballed.</v>

541
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 2>There was a company called the American computer company.</v>

542
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember them?</v>

543
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 2>It was a American computer company,</v>

544
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 2>US computer company,</v>

545
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.050
<v Speaker 2>but it was run by some people who were claiming to have some sort of technology</v>

546
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.240
<v Speaker 2>and some sort of an infer information about the,</v>

547
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 2>the progress of technology as it pertains to the government back engineering</v>

548
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 2>alien spacecrafts on Roswell.</v>

549
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

550
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I have not heard from that company.</v>

551
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Speaker 2>It was a long time ago.</v>

552
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:37.611
<v Speaker 2>Art Bell Days,</v>

553
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 2>I think he was like a sponsor art bell show or something.</v>

554
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean even even the idea of IBM,</v>

555
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.300
<v Speaker 6>there are ideas that the IBM was funded after they exchanged of some type of</v>

556
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:54.861
<v Speaker 6>information between the government and a themselves after the Roswell crash and</v>

557
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 6>in some exchange of knowledge.</v>

558
00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.820
<v Speaker 6>And then ever since then,</v>

559
00:15:59.821 --> 00:16:00.031
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

560
00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:04.050
<v Speaker 6>IBM I think is the first company that came out with a computer chip and things</v>

561
00:16:04.051 --> 00:16:04.884
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

562
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:09.060
<v Speaker 6>So the question that Phillip Corso asked himself in his book that they,</v>

563
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:10.020
<v Speaker 6>after Roswell,</v>

564
00:16:10.021 --> 00:16:10.854
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

565
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.740
<v Speaker 6>where did IBM get this technology from?</v>

566
00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:18.670
<v Speaker 6>Because they basically sprung up out of nowhere and then they have this,</v>

567
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.533
<v Speaker 6>this chip.</v>

568
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.220
<v Speaker 2>So what does work though?</v>

569
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Someone like had an invention.</v>

570
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:22.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

571
00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:23.291
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>

572
00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.640
<v Speaker 2>that isn't how things happen.</v>

573
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Like someone had felt some course,</v>

574
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.880
<v Speaker 2>but it do just spring out of nowhere.</v>

575
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.743
<v Speaker 2>It was discussed</v>

576
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.960
<v Speaker 6>and he had basically sprung out of nowhere and you know,</v>

577
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.850
<v Speaker 6>core so had actually worked in the government and so he had all these redacted</v>

578
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:40.870
<v Speaker 6>documents that he was able to read when they were unredacted and things like</v>

579
00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:41.680
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

580
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.221
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

581
00:16:42.221 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 6>so he made a point that he thinks that our,</v>

582
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:46.803
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

583
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.100
<v Speaker 6>very quick industrial revolution and everything else too until you know,</v>

584
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:54.820
<v Speaker 6>putting a man on the moon and now we're in the international space station and</v>

585
00:16:54.821 --> 00:16:56.440
<v Speaker 6>things like this that,</v>

586
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:56.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

587
00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.970
<v Speaker 6>is this acceleration of technology must have had some type of an</v>

588
00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:02.410
<v Speaker 6>extraterrestrial origin.</v>

589
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.310
<v Speaker 6>And he placed it on,</v>

590
00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:07.780
<v Speaker 6>on Roswell in 1946 47.</v>

591
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.610
<v Speaker 2>That sounds ridiculous.</v>

592
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.430
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

593
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.460
<v Speaker 2>but if it was true,</v>

594
00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:13.330
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking,</v>

595
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.060
<v Speaker 2>what a mind fuck that they found a crash sauce and what,</v>

596
00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:17.320
<v Speaker 2>how fuck are they doing this?</v>

597
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And they backed the whole thing up.</v>

598
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I have that Roswell,</v>

599
00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 2>a newspaper clipping on my wall.</v>

600
00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I have a print of it framed on my wall.</v>

601
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

602
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.100
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to look at.</v>

603
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.000
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to look at.</v>

604
00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

605
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:29.161
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

606
00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:29.410
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

607
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you stop and think if it was some sort of government craft,</v>

608
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:35.830
<v Speaker 2>how many people would have been in the know and if it was some sort of,</v>

609
00:17:35.831 --> 00:17:36.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

610
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:39.400
<v Speaker 2>they know the Nazis back then had some Ufo looking devices,</v>

612
00:17:39.401 --> 00:17:39.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:41.050
<v Speaker 2>they had some flying discs.</v>

614
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

615
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.213
<v Speaker 2>Which is a,</v>

616
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.950
<v Speaker 2>makes you wonder like what came first the chicken or the egg,</v>

617
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:45.883
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

618
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Did they see some shit and try to like,</v>

619
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.881
<v Speaker 2>it was like Whoa,</v>

620
00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 2>how fuck did they do in that?</v>

621
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 7>We've got to figure out how to make one of those.</v>

622
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

623
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.841
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

624
00:17:52.841 --> 00:17:53.674
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

625
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean why,</v>

626
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 7>why make a disk?</v>

627
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:55.891
<v Speaker 7>Why,</v>

628
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:56.461
<v Speaker 7>what are you doing?</v>

629
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 7>Where are you getting that idea from?</v>

630
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.251
<v Speaker 7>Why is it a disc?</v>

631
00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 7>Is the disc supposed to come from a mothership?</v>

632
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 7>Do they have theories on that?</v>

633
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 7>To be honest with you personally,</v>

634
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:09.171
<v Speaker 7>I have no idea because I really am not into modern a UFO stories and stuff like</v>

635
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

636
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 7>However I've been told and due to the shape,</v>

637
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 7>cause apparently these things they spin and they spin.</v>

638
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 7>They create some type of a vortex or an energy field,</v>

639
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 7>and that's how they're able to travel.</v>

640
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 7>So I guess that's the best shape for again,</v>

641
00:18:22.921 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 7>sounds completely ridiculous.</v>

642
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 7>And let us,</v>

643
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 7>you stop and think about like how about these cave paintings that they recently</v>

644
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 7>found that,</v>

645
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:29.980
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

646
00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 7>turn out to be a lot older than they thought.</v>

647
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 7>And our result is 40,000 years ago,</v>

648
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 7>which is making people think that it perhaps in the enter talls even,</v>

649
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

650
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 7>we're doing cave art.</v>

651
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.660
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't just a homosapien and not only that,</v>

652
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 7>but what many people don't realize is that neanderthal and Homo sapiens</v>

653
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.863
<v Speaker 7>coexisted.</v>

654
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.060
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

655
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 7>And then in a bread bowl essentially then died out.</v>

656
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:53.910
<v Speaker 7>But yes,</v>

657
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.743
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

658
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 7>And a lot of [inaudible] and that was something that five years ago was</v>

659
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:00.060
<v Speaker 7>completely anathema.</v>

660
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 7>Nobody talked about it.</v>

661
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:02.580
<v Speaker 7>And then the research came out at,</v>

662
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:03.391
<v Speaker 7>hold on a second,</v>

663
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 7>we found these new fossils and man,</v>

664
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 7>they coexisted.</v>

665
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:09.800
<v Speaker 7>So why did Neanderthal Diet over homosapiens?</v>

666
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.120
<v Speaker 7>Because neanderthal was stronger,</v>

667
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 7>had bigger brains,</v>

668
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.720
<v Speaker 7>a bigger bone structure.</v>

669
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.930
<v Speaker 7>So if the whole survival of the fittest evolution theory were true,</v>

670
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 7>then logically you would have to say that neanderthal should've won out over</v>

671
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 7>homosapiens cause we're puny compared to home with SAPE.</v>

672
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:30.661
<v Speaker 7>Well they were,</v>

673
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:31.351
<v Speaker 7>there were short,</v>

674
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:33.440
<v Speaker 7>but they were really like stalky and wide.</v>

675
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.110
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

676
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.943
<v Speaker 7>Elsewhere.</v>

677
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 7>But there's stupid as fuck.</v>

678
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 7>So we ganged him.</v>

679
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.913
<v Speaker 7>That's how it works.</v>

680
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 7>But that's the big question.</v>

681
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.730
<v Speaker 7>Allegedly,</v>

682
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.341
<v Speaker 7>not allegedly,</v>

683
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:43.050
<v Speaker 7>but they had bigger brains.</v>

684
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.411
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

685
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 7>So does an elephant.</v>

686
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

687
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.031
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

688
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 7>But it's the size of the body.</v>

689
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 7>They were like five foot three and they were over 200 pounds.</v>

690
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 7>They had like really thick bones and they would probably be beat the shit out of</v>

691
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:52.950
<v Speaker 7>us.</v>

692
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 7>They were collect closer to chimps than than we are,</v>

693
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.993
<v Speaker 7>which is why I'm,</v>

694
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 7>I always say I'm mostly Niana tall.</v>

695
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.843
<v Speaker 7>Probably.</v>

696
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 7>If I had to go back and look at my gene pool,</v>

697
00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:03.670
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure someone got fucked by a cave man.</v>

698
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 7>You would.</v>

699
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:04.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

700
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 7>My point was if you,</v>

701
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

702
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 7>if you look at that cave art from 40,000 years ago and look at anything that we</v>

703
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:12.744
<v Speaker 7>do today,</v>

704
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 7>it would seem completely impossible.</v>

705
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 7>And 40,000 years in the span of the universe is literally nothing,</v>

706
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:19.650
<v Speaker 7>a blip.</v>

707
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.550
<v Speaker 7>Not even nothing.</v>

708
00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 7>Not even,</v>

709
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.601
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

710
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.070
<v Speaker 7>you can't even wrap your head around it.</v>

711
00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:28.071
<v Speaker 7>So whenever I talk to someone who's skeptical about aliens or time travel or</v>

712
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:29.424
<v Speaker 7>anything,</v>

713
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.211
<v Speaker 7>and I was like,</v>

714
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:30.630
<v Speaker 7>bitch,</v>

715
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 7>you are using magic right now.</v>

716
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:33.961
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>

717
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 7>you're on a phone,</v>

718
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.540
<v Speaker 7>you're talking to someone,</v>

719
00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:41.490
<v Speaker 7>nowhere near you with a device that you can also talk to and get fucking answers</v>

720
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 7>from about virtually anything.</v>

721
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 7>You talk to it.</v>

722
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.510
<v Speaker 7>You ask it,</v>

723
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 7>you know who created the Sistine Chapel?</v>

724
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 4>Who did the painting,</v>

725
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

726
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.871
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

727
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:50.840
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't me,</v>

728
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 4>Michael and Oh we,</v>

729
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:52.781
<v Speaker 4>in order to Vinci,</v>

730
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 4>which one of those motherfuckers was it?</v>

731
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 4>Did they find out instantly on your goddamn phone?</v>

732
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Some shit that happened thousands of years ago.</v>

733
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 4>So for us to even like,</v>

734
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 4>well of course it's possible.</v>

735
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Something could have an energy vortex.</v>

736
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.653
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

737
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Siri's talking to you.</v>

738
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.760
<v Speaker 4>You could have something some day that travels by virtue of some sort of anti</v>

739
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 4>gravitational field or some new type of,</v>

740
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

741
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

742
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.400
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a harnessing of anti matter.</v>

743
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:22.661
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

744
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 4>there's so many possibilities as you look at energy sources and then you,</v>

745
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.930
<v Speaker 4>you sort of have to extrapolate how far we've come in such a blip of time and</v>

746
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 4>then think of a thousand years,</v>

747
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 4>think of a million years,</v>

748
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.191
<v Speaker 4>a million years.</v>

749
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Ain't shit for the universe.</v>

750
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 4>A million years is nothing.</v>

751
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.701
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

752
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 4>there's certain stars that have lives that are much,</v>

753
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.540
<v Speaker 4>much longer than ours.</v>

754
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 4>Like our star is only going to last for like a few billion years,</v>

755
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

756
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

757
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 4>And then it'd be done,</v>

758
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

759
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 4>And then everything on this planet,</v>

760
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be done too.</v>

761
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 4>But they're stars that been fine forever.</v>

762
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.301
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

763
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:59.740
<v Speaker 4>there's stars that lasts much longer and they live in solar systems that don't</v>

764
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 4>have er asteroids in them.</v>

765
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 4>That's possible too.</v>

766
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.480
<v Speaker 4>It's every solar system doesn't have some fucking gigantic asteroid belt like we</v>

767
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 4>did right.</v>

768
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Between Mars and Jupiter,</v>

769
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 4>there's hundreds of thousands of these near Earth objects that could just fuck</v>

770
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.340
<v Speaker 4>everything up.</v>

771
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.450
<v Speaker 4>All they have to do is come flying in and it could happen any second if and when</v>

772
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 4>people don't know is Jupiter saves us.</v>

773
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Speaker 4>If it wasn't for Jupiter,</v>

774
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 4>there was no way we'd be this stable Jupiter and our moon.</v>

775
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Speaker 4>Those two things are critical.</v>

776
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.840
<v Speaker 4>Our Moon to keep our,</v>

777
00:22:29.841 --> 00:22:30.081
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

778
00:22:30.081 --> 00:22:33.840
<v Speaker 4>our orbit very stable and very similar like it,</v>

779
00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't vary too much.</v>

780
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 4>And the Jupiter is the,</v>

781
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.950
<v Speaker 4>like the magnet for all the asteroids and the,</v>

782
00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:45.070
<v Speaker 4>this amateur astronomers who have caught like recent asteroid impacts.</v>

783
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:45.761
<v Speaker 4>It was Jupiter,</v>

784
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:46.331
<v Speaker 4>Saturn,</v>

785
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember which one it was.</v>

786
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure it was Jupiter.</v>

787
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.301
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

788
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:49.781
<v Speaker 4>it was Jupiter.</v>

789
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:51.480
<v Speaker 4>It was a big fucking impact.</v>

790
00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:53.080
<v Speaker 4>And this amateur astronomer caught it.</v>

791
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 4>So their shit how fair this shit out there that comes fucking flying down.</v>

792
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 4>If we lived in a place that didn't have that shit out there.</v>

793
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.930
<v Speaker 4>So if there was a water base planet like ours and some place that didn't have</v>

794
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:05.920
<v Speaker 4>the same issues,</v>

795
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:06.760
<v Speaker 4>they could,</v>

796
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 4>they could exist a million years longer than us.</v>

797
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Wrap your head around that because they want it.</v>

798
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.780
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't be extinct at some point.</v>

799
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 4>What us some sort of an impact.</v>

800
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:15.851
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

801
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:16.391
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>

802
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 4>we're late to the game.</v>

803
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 4>This planet is late to the game.</v>

804
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:23.320
<v Speaker 4>This player zone four billionaires have 4.6 billion years old or something like</v>

805
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

806
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 4>People don't understand the universe.</v>

807
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.470
<v Speaker 4>That ain't shit just for what their current understanding of the universe is is</v>

808
00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around 14 plus billion light years old.</v>

809
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 4>God Damn Man,</v>

810
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:35.860
<v Speaker 4>4 billion years and ain't shit.</v>

811
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.723
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing.</v>

812
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Then you got to wrap your fucking head around the fact that a human being is</v>

813
00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:44.680
<v Speaker 4>actually constructed out of star dust that are the molecules and the the,</v>

814
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

815
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:45.080
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

816
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.510
<v Speaker 4>the this,</v>

817
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>the actual</v>

818
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.980
<v Speaker 6>ingredients for us literally have to be made inside stars and then that star</v>

819
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.980
<v Speaker 6>blows up and then somehow or another it becomes a person.</v>

820
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

821
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 6>we are all inside.</v>

822
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 6>If you take a piece of skin and you look at it underneath the electron</v>

823
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:04.424
<v Speaker 6>microscope,</v>

824
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.241
<v Speaker 6>you see it.</v>

825
00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:06.490
<v Speaker 6>Everything wobbles at the,</v>

826
00:24:06.491 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 6>the deeper you go into decor,</v>

827
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 6>everything vibrates.</v>

828
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 6>It's all about harmonics.</v>

829
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 6>Now we just looked at a piece of skin.</v>

830
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 6>If you take a piece of stone and you go at the same core,</v>

831
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.260
<v Speaker 6>you see the exact same thing.</v>

832
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 6>You cannot distinguish between the two.</v>

833
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 6>And that to me is absolutely fascinating because it means there really is no</v>

834
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:29.120
<v Speaker 6>difference between material that's considered organic and inorganic.</v>

835
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 6>One is alive and one is dead,</v>

836
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 6>but is it really dead?</v>

837
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:37.330
<v Speaker 6>It's not because we all consist of the same stuff or as a you said of star stuff</v>

838
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:38.901
<v Speaker 6>and that was,</v>

839
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:39.171
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

840
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:44.171
<v Speaker 6>an idea that a calls Sagan brought forth and you know what,</v>

841
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 6>what better brain than him to to you know,</v>

842
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 6>introduce these ideas because it's crazy.</v>

843
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 6>The across Eggo is an amazing guy.</v>

844
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 6>He actually wrote that movie contact for the folks who don't even know,</v>

845
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 6>which I saw recently and still holds up,</v>

846
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.390
<v Speaker 6>still holds.</v>

847
00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.170
<v Speaker 6>It's an amazing solid moving.</v>

848
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 6>We we that alone,</v>

849
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.313
<v Speaker 6>just that.</v>

850
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:03.811
<v Speaker 6>Just the,</v>

851
00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:04.101
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

852
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 6>just getting to let,</v>

853
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 6>just the idea of subatomic particles,</v>

854
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 6>just the idea of cells and atoms and molecules,</v>

855
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.150
<v Speaker 6>just the idea of that is way crazier than the idea of aliens.</v>

856
00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:14.481
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

857
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:14.961
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

858
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:16.760
<v Speaker 6>what's fascinating to me also is that,</v>

859
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

860
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.720
<v Speaker 6>talking about aliens or other solar systems or actually other galaxies out</v>

861
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:23.804
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

862
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

863
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.090
<v Speaker 6>astronomers today have sore or,</v>

864
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

865
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.490
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

866
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 6>astronomers have,</v>

867
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:33.190
<v Speaker 6>have suggested that there are more galaxies in the entire universe than there</v>

868
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 6>are grains of sand on all the beaches in the world.</v>

869
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.010
<v Speaker 6>Now</v>

870
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.010
<v Speaker 2>think about that for just,</v>

871
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:42.640
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

872
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

873
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.740
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

874
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.570
<v Speaker 2>We're so nothing,</v>

875
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>and we're so everything and,</v>

876
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and galaxies.</v>

877
00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:52.360
<v Speaker 2>And each galaxy has billions of,</v>

878
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.500
<v Speaker 2>of solar systems,</v>

879
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.573
<v Speaker 2>each galaxy,</v>

880
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.450
<v Speaker 2>and there's more galaxies than sand,</v>

881
00:25:57.451 --> 00:25:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the grains of sand.</v>

882
00:25:58.451 --> 00:26:03.070
<v Speaker 2>And then ultimately the ultimate mind fuck is that they now believe that inside</v>

883
00:26:03.071 --> 00:26:04.870
<v Speaker 2>every black holes and other universe,</v>

884
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.570
<v Speaker 2>that a black hole is literally a dimensional door.</v>

885
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Something will you,</v>

886
00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:09.790
<v Speaker 2>if you pass through that,</v>

887
00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:13.840
<v Speaker 2>you will literally go into a new fucking universe.</v>

888
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

889
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.310
<v Speaker 2>there's hundreds of billions of them because each solar system at the center of</v>

890
00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:20.470
<v Speaker 2>every galaxy is a supermassive black hole.</v>

891
00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:24.040
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly one half of 1% of the entire mass of the galaxy is something they</v>

892
00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:26.890
<v Speaker 2>figured out and the early two thousands they didn't know.</v>

893
00:26:26.891 --> 00:26:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean they didn't know that.</v>

894
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:28.820
<v Speaker 2>They kind of,</v>

895
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.100
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of people that knew that that black holes were around,</v>

896
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:33.611
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

897
00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:38.080
<v Speaker 2>to know that they're in the center of every single galaxy and that is directly</v>

898
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:39.760
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to the size of the galaxy,</v>

899
00:26:39.761 --> 00:26:40.130
<v Speaker 2>the mass,</v>

900
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.963
<v Speaker 2>the black hole,</v>

901
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and the latest idea being that if you went</v>

902
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.090
<v Speaker 4>through that black hole,</v>

903
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 4>that that black hole literally would bring you into another universe that may or</v>

904
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 4>may not be anything like this.</v>

905
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.350
<v Speaker 4>It may be exactly.</v>

906
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.160
<v Speaker 4>It may be that what we're seeing is just like some sort of an operating system</v>

907
00:26:56.161 --> 00:27:01.161
<v Speaker 4>that runs over reality and that we're not just existing in even one universe.</v>

908
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 4>As a person like Lena,</v>

909
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.680
<v Speaker 4>when I say that you can change your life.</v>

910
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 4>If you change your direction,</v>

911
00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:07.890
<v Speaker 4>you can change your life.</v>

912
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

913
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 4>maybe you actually can for real.</v>

914
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe every time you make a decision,</v>

915
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 4>every second of every day a new universe has created with a different,</v>

916
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 4>a different set of probabilities and possibilities and it all operates inside of</v>

917
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:23.160
<v Speaker 4>the operating system that you've chosen to accept.</v>

918
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:23.701
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

919
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Western civilization America,</v>

920
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.880
<v Speaker 4>2012 Giorgio sucralose with his crazy hair,</v>

921
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan with no hair on computers talk.</v>

922
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean what I'm saying like,</v>

923
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:39.171
<v Speaker 4>but what you actually are might be this like piece of the universe that's</v>

924
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:46.761
<v Speaker 4>expressing itself through different forms over and over again throughout time.</v>

925
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:47.701
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>

926
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:48.001
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

927
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 4>you are this eternal thing that's a part of this massive thing that's too big</v>

928
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 4>for you to possibly understand.</v>

929
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.220
<v Speaker 4>So your child,</v>

930
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.620
<v Speaker 4>your job is just to try to go along in this,</v>

931
00:27:58.621 --> 00:27:59.041
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

932
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:00.930
<v Speaker 4>this path you're doing and create energy.</v>

933
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.440
<v Speaker 4>See if you could figure out what's the,</v>

934
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 4>what's the best way to get the good feelings?</v>

935
00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 4>What's the best way to have the best time?</v>

936
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 4>What's the best way to spread the,</v>

937
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.760
<v Speaker 4>but what you're doing is you're like a harvester of energy and that it's just</v>

938
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:15.510
<v Speaker 4>done through this body in this life and that it's going on everywhere,</v>

939
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 4>all around you,</v>

940
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:16.951
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

941
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 4>And you literally are the universe.</v>

942
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

943
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.780
<v Speaker 4>And then after having said all of this,</v>

944
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 4>which was absolutely beautiful,</v>

945
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 4>there's still people out there who will say,</v>

946
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 4>we are alone in the universe.</v>

947
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Those people are silly bitches.</v>

948
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 4>That's desk that the Ed to say,</v>

949
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:32.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

950
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 4>it's like people who say that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,</v>

951
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.311
<v Speaker 4>shut up,</v>

952
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:35.870
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

953
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of information that shows us something was going on.</v>

954
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:43.140
<v Speaker 4>There's a massive amount of fuckery afoot for you to say in 2012 that you are</v>

955
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 4>sure because I've looked at the information and I just don't see it.</v>

956
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.193
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you're an idiot?</v>

957
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

958
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.920
<v Speaker 4>you're not telling the truth or you have decided that you don't want the world</v>

959
00:28:52.921 --> 00:28:54.930
<v Speaker 4>to be as complicated as it really truly is.</v>

960
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 4>And so you're compartmentalizing no people.</v>

961
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:57.811
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

962
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:02.811
<v Speaker 4>People always have to be ready to accept certain realities they want.</v>

963
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 4>They want laws and rules.</v>

964
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of water or not ready.</v>

965
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

966
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.450
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

967
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.180
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

968
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.720
<v Speaker 4>That's the real thought about aliens.</v>

969
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:12.120
<v Speaker 4>And that's the one thing when I think if I was the president,</v>

970
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:12.721
<v Speaker 4>what would I do?</v>

971
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:16.580
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely not tell people the same mother fuckers that are watching Kim</v>

972
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Kardashian now.</v>

973
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not telling you if I knew that there were aliens,</v>

974
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 4>if I knew that there was hanger f 18 out in,</v>

975
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.200
<v Speaker 4>where was it?</v>

976
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Ohio,</v>

977
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.420
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

978
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that where they Wright Patterson air force base.</v>

979
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 4>They flew the wreckage of,</v>

980
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:29.370
<v Speaker 4>that's the other thing.</v>

981
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 4>If you want to think that it was just a a just a weather balloon.</v>

982
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.690
<v Speaker 4>They flew the fucking wreckage in two separate planes and Eisenhower met them</v>

983
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

984
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 4>They flew it to Wright Patterson air force base.</v>

985
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>And the reason they flew it in two separate plans because they didn't want the</v>

986
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 7>plane to crash and then lose all the information.</v>

987
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.050
<v Speaker 7>So they,</v>

988
00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:45.401
<v Speaker 7>they put,</v>

989
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:49.640
<v Speaker 7>they separated it into two planes just to make sure that they got some,</v>

990
00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 7>some of it got there,</v>

991
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

992
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 7>They were so worried about plane crashes.</v>

993
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:59.191
<v Speaker 7>They sent two planes and that was what that Jesse Marcel guy had said,</v>

994
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:00.000
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

995
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 7>Or W who is the,</v>

996
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

997
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

998
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 7>the rancher was the ranchers name that discovered it.</v>

999
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 7>To be honest with you.</v>

1000
00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 7>I don't you don't remember the names.</v>

1001
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:07.780
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1002
00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.021
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

1003
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 7>it's a really fascinating story folks,</v>

1004
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.230
<v Speaker 7>because the people that were there have like all these crazy stories of what</v>

1005
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:14.801
<v Speaker 7>went down.</v>

1006
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:18.820
<v Speaker 7>Some people saw bodies and there was one guy who was a local corner and they</v>

1007
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 7>asked him to actually make some,</v>

1008
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1009
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.160
<v Speaker 7>some coffin,</v>

1010
00:30:22.161 --> 00:30:22.994
<v Speaker 7>some small,</v>

1011
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 7>three foot long coffins.</v>

1012
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 7>And he thought there was some dead children and they,</v>

1013
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:26.801
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1014
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:27.351
<v Speaker 7>they brought him,</v>

1015
00:30:27.351 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 7>they wanted,</v>

1016
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.061
<v Speaker 7>he will,</v>

1017
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:28.361
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1018
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:28.551
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

1019
00:30:28.551 --> 00:30:32.080
<v Speaker 7>they have these things there and they were rotten and stinking supposedly,</v>

1020
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.521
<v Speaker 7>but me,</v>

1021
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 7>it sounds ridiculous,</v>

1022
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.000
<v Speaker 7>but so do we.</v>

1023
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.431
<v Speaker 7>We sound,</v>

1024
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:39.430
<v Speaker 7>we're just the fact that we're doing this fucking podcast,</v>

1025
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 7>this is ridiculous.</v>

1026
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 7>We're sitting here,</v>

1027
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 7>we're talking and somehow or another are talking gets broken down in a ones and</v>

1028
00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 7>Zeros and sent through the air.</v>

1029
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.700
<v Speaker 7>I'm not even connecting anything.</v>

1030
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.080
<v Speaker 7>This fucking thing is wireless.</v>

1031
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.040
<v Speaker 7>It is magic.</v>

1032
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 7>It's nuts.</v>

1033
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.590
<v Speaker 7>It's craziness.</v>

1034
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.710
<v Speaker 7>Just that is absolute fucking craziness and right now thousands of people are</v>

1035
00:30:58.861 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 7>listening and by the time they sent the whole thing is over be somewhere around</v>

1036
00:31:01.301 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 7>a half a million people have been contacted by these words coming out of our</v>

1037
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 7>mouth.</v>

1038
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 7>That's nuts.</v>

1039
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 7>It totally is because you know if you look at the the the status coincides and</v>

1040
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:12.901
<v Speaker 7>all of this,</v>

1041
00:31:12.901 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 7>you know everybody's about physics,</v>

1042
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:14.560
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1043
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.930
<v Speaker 7>physics that but if you think about it,</v>

1044
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 7>physics and Newtonian physics that we apply to our physical world right here do</v>

1045
00:31:21.911 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 7>not apply on a subatomic level which is quantum physics.</v>

1046
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.440
<v Speaker 7>Newtonian laws of physics do not apply at all in quantum physics.</v>

1047
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.590
<v Speaker 7>What you're saying is well for folks who don't know there was a finance said it</v>

1048
00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:35.951
<v Speaker 7>best.</v>

1049
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:37.570
<v Speaker 7>If you think you understand quantum physics,</v>

1050
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:39.330
<v Speaker 7>you don't understand quantum physics exact cause.</v>

1051
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 7>Nobody understands it.</v>

1052
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 7>Well I shouldn't say nobody understands it cause there are,</v>

1053
00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Speaker 7>there are certain things that we have figured out and discovered an under</v>

1054
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 7>certain things that we know but there's some madness in re like what has been</v>

1055
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 7>proven.</v>

1056
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.091
<v Speaker 7>It's in,</v>

1057
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 7>it's all mathematically,</v>

1058
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 7>which makes no sense to me because I'm an idiot.</v>

1059
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.721
<v Speaker 7>It comes to math.</v>

1060
00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:57.490
<v Speaker 7>I am literally a monkey.</v>

1061
00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 7>Same here man.</v>

1062
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 7>But what they have figured out is that there are particles that can exist in a</v>

1063
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 7>super position where they were moving and still at the same time.</v>

1064
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 7>And then things blink in and out of existence.</v>

1065
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.820
<v Speaker 7>Like they literally aren't there anymore.</v>

1066
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.990
<v Speaker 7>And then they come back,</v>

1067
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:19.020
<v Speaker 7>they go away and then they come back nature of reality or you have one particle</v>

1068
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 7>and you've got a cardboard thing with two holes and before you know it,</v>

1069
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:29.670
<v Speaker 7>you look away and to particle finds itself on the other side of those two holes</v>

1070
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 7>really,</v>

1071
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 7>or one hole or two particles go through.</v>

1072
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.551
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's,</v>

1073
00:32:32.551 --> 00:32:32.971
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1074
00:32:32.971 --> 00:32:33.431
<v Speaker 7>it's this,</v>

1075
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:33.780
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1076
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1077
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.150
<v Speaker 7>someone actually explained to me that whole thing about the,</v>

1078
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:37.750
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1079
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 7>the results changing once you measure them,</v>

1080
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.230
<v Speaker 2>that the observer changes the results.</v>

1081
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1082
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.160
<v Speaker 2>But what do you mean sent it out?</v>

1083
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 2>This is WIC,</v>

1084
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.130
<v Speaker 2>that friend in the movie or a documentary called what the bleep do we know?</v>

1085
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:49.930
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1086
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1087
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1088
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I put that up online.</v>

1089
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad we had this discussion because there's a lot of fuckery when it comes</v>

1090
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.330
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>

1091
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.130
<v Speaker 2>That was all a created by the same people who did the secret.</v>

1092
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's like those,</v>

1093
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:04.610
<v Speaker 2>it's that lady who's like,</v>

1094
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1095
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:05.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1096
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking too much.</v>

1097
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:09.170
<v Speaker 2>She's like some sort of cult type lady ramp,</v>

1098
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.461
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

1100
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:10.720
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1101
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1102
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 2>what the bleep do we know?</v>

1103
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 2>And through the rabbit hole and all that stuff,</v>

1104
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.270
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1105
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 2>there's some fuckery to what they're saying.</v>

1106
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And here's,</v>

1107
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>here's one of the parts of it.</v>

1108
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the results change is because someone's looking at it.</v>

1109
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 2>It's because you're measuring it.</v>

1110
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.670
<v Speaker 2>And so they've decided to make something really woo woo,</v>

1111
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.590
<v Speaker 2>which is quantum physics is crazy.</v>

1112
00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Woowoo enough as it is.</v>

1113
00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 2>They tried to add some sort of a mystical spiritual element to it that secure</v>

1114
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.710
<v Speaker 2>controlling it with your mind.</v>

1115
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm doctor Quantom.</v>

1116
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1117
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1118
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's correct.</v>

1119
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:45.230
<v Speaker 2>According to My friend Wick,</v>

1120
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Aka j d,</v>

1121
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1122
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:47.571
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1123
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:48.404
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1124
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:52.820
<v Speaker 2>he said that it is all which totally makes sense and that this is something</v>

1125
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 2>that's really frustrating to actual real physicists.</v>

1126
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.331
<v Speaker 2>That these,</v>

1127
00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:57.950
<v Speaker 2>these sort of ridiculous,</v>

1128
00:33:57.951 --> 00:33:58.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1129
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 2>interpretations of physics that are,</v>

1130
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1131
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.840
<v Speaker 2>expressed really inaccurately,</v>

1132
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:06.250
<v Speaker 2>almost on purpose to make people think that there's,</v>

1133
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:06.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 2>that the secret is real.</v>

1135
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.051
<v Speaker 2>The secret,</v>

1136
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1137
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>may be real if you're a winner and if you succeed then the secret trail,</v>

1138
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

1139
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 2>You get hit in the head by a fucking media or you didn't ask for that bitch.</v>

1140
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.321
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1141
00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not really controlling the whole ball of wax.</v>

1142
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:21.620
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

1143
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.730
<v Speaker 2>You can't really create,</v>

1144
00:34:22.731 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 2>reality is some randomness is experience.</v>

1145
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.070
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly affect certain things.</v>

1146
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly with positive energy affect your,</v>

1147
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 2>your immediate environment,</v>

1148
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:32.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 2>by creating good feelings amongst friends and things like that.</v>

1150
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 2>But you got controlling asteroids,</v>

1151
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.174
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

1152
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 2>they're coming and they killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</v>

1154
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.813
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1155
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.661
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1156
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 2>and they might've killed people off a 12 point 9,000 years ago.</v>

1157
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:49.963
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard this?</v>

1158
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

1159
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 2>some of the latest data that's coming out.</v>

1160
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:56.810
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like a bad mother fucker cause I sent this to John Anthony West and</v>

1161
00:34:56.811 --> 00:34:59.030
<v Speaker 2>he had not heard it yet and I was like,</v>

1162
00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.991
<v Speaker 2>yeah bitch,</v>

1163
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I am your portal to new information.</v>

1164
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I got it through Twitter,</v>

1165
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.720
<v Speaker 2>some tweets,</v>

1166
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 2>which is the coolest shit about Twitter.</v>

1167
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1168
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:08.180
<v Speaker 2>someone will send you like cool shit that you,</v>

1169
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean I find out more cool shit through Twitter than anything.</v>

1170
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Now Twitter and my message board,</v>

1171
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:13.934
<v Speaker 2>those are the two things,</v>

1172
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.871
<v Speaker 2>but 12,000,</v>

1173
00:35:14.871 --> 00:35:15.740
<v Speaker 2>900 years ago,</v>

1174
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 2>they know that there was some massive meteor impacts all over the planet.</v>

1175
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 2>They've confirmed it now by the,</v>

1176
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1177
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.993
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

1178
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:23.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1179
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the world have this sort of,</v>

1180
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1181
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 2>glass that's created from incredible heat and impacts.</v>

1182
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1183
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.010
<v Speaker 2>They have some from the atomic energy sites,</v>

1184
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1185
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:34.491
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1186
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 2>where we tested nuclear explosions and created it.</v>

1187
00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1188
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>they've also found this</v>

1189
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 7>stuff and it's all at 12,900 years old.</v>

1190
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 7>When they do like core samples and the date,</v>

1191
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.741
<v Speaker 7>the date,</v>

1192
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 7>the time of it,</v>

1193
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 7>it's all to 12,900 which is really fascinating because that's when all the</v>

1194
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 7>people that believe that there was some ancient civilization that was far more</v>

1195
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 7>advanced than we give them credit,</v>

1196
00:35:55.471 --> 00:35:57.410
<v Speaker 7>like ancient Sumeria,</v>

1197
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 7>Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.</v>

1198
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 7>The idea is that 12,900 years ago,</v>

1199
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 7>there was probably already a hugely advanced culture.</v>

1200
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:13.130
<v Speaker 7>Like we just assume that this tiny amount of space between 12,900 years ago and</v>

1201
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 7>today,</v>

1202
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.410
<v Speaker 7>which is in the galaxy is again,</v>

1203
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.273
<v Speaker 7>it's nothing.</v>

1204
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 7>We may have had to start over 12,900 years ago.</v>

1205
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:27.141
<v Speaker 7>We may have been bombarded by giant pieces of rock from the sky that killed off</v>

1206
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 7>a huge amount of people and we had to start from scratch literally as hunter and</v>

1207
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:32.971
<v Speaker 7>gatherers.</v>

1208
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 7>We literally had to do it like a fucking Kevin Costner movie.</v>

1209
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 7>Like we're like the post man.</v>

1210
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's really possible that at one point in time there were some really</v>

1211
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 7>incredibly sophisticated societies.</v>

1212
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things that's evidence is some shit that you brought me right</v>

1213
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>

1214
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.800
<v Speaker 7>The Age Blah from Puma poon coup.</v>

1215
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.820
<v Speaker 7>He brought me a replica of a,</v>

1216
00:36:51.821 --> 00:36:54.660
<v Speaker 7>a real stone that exists.</v>

1217
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.210
<v Speaker 7>You want a mind fuck on a much larger scale.</v>

1218
00:36:57.211 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>

1219
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.440
<v Speaker 7>that's just,</v>

1220
00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:58.921
<v Speaker 7>Oh of course.</v>

1221
00:36:58.921 --> 00:36:59.041
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1222
00:36:59.041 --> 00:36:59.874
<v Speaker 7>this is fine.</v>

1223
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.680
<v Speaker 7>But it's,</v>

1224
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 7>but it's incredible just to look at it as a tiny thing to thank.</v>

1225
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 7>If an ancient civilization created this,</v>

1226
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.810
<v Speaker 7>like what kind of amazing machinery did they have to cut out these right angles?</v>

1227
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 7>Cause this really is representative of the actual stone structure.</v>

1228
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 7>You want a mind fuck folks go.</v>

1229
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:16.380
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1230
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 7>there's video on demand.</v>

1231
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.770
<v Speaker 7>If you have that shit and you can get ancient aliens,</v>

1232
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.610
<v Speaker 7>watch them.</v>

1233
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.960
<v Speaker 7>The most recent one,</v>

1234
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:25.080
<v Speaker 7>the Puma punk who one episode in season four?</v>

1235
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.071
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1236
00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 7>The mysterious city of Puma,</v>

1237
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:28.580
<v Speaker 7>Puma [inaudible] mind.</v>

1238
00:37:28.581 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 7>Fuck that places.</v>

1239
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.050
<v Speaker 7>It really is because I think that,</v>

1240
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 7>what's the altitude 12 almost 12,800 feet.</v>

1241
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 7>So that is,</v>

1242
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.251
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1243
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:38.361
<v Speaker 7>an,</v>

1244
00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 7>an altitude altitude where the air is already very rarefied.</v>

1245
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.050
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1246
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:43.261
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1247
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 7>you get tired real quick when you run around up there and you have this giant</v>

1248
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:51.900
<v Speaker 7>field of ruins with these giant stone platforms that way,</v>

1249
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 7>or they start at like 80 tons,</v>

1250
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:56.580
<v Speaker 7>these platforms and you know,</v>

1251
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.890
<v Speaker 7>when archeologist or when you ask archeologists,</v>

1252
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 7>how did they move these giant stone platforms,</v>

1253
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.401
<v Speaker 7>they'll say,</v>

1254
00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:02.641
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1255
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:03.211
<v Speaker 7>no problem.</v>

1256
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 7>They used wooden rollers.</v>

1257
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.090
<v Speaker 7>And of course the entire world goes,</v>

1258
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:06.810
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1259
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:07.700
<v Speaker 7>plausible idea,</v>

1260
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.790
<v Speaker 7>plausible explanation.</v>

1261
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.901
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1262
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1263
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.450
<v Speaker 7>the truth of the matter is that a 12,000,</v>

1264
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:13.284
<v Speaker 7>800 feet,</v>

1265
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.540
<v Speaker 7>you're above the natural tree line.</v>

1266
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 7>So no trees ever grew at that altitude.</v>

1267
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 7>And so if you then propose,</v>

1268
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:21.571
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

1269
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:23.130
<v Speaker 7>so they went to a lower altitude,</v>

1270
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 7>got all the logs up there and use it then for wooden rollers,</v>

1271
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 7>if you only put a two ton block on top of a wooden roller,</v>

1272
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.240
<v Speaker 7>the roller breaks.</v>

1273
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.440
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

1274
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:34.681
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1275
00:38:34.681 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 7>the whole idea of wooden rollers</v>

1276
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.083
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1277
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 6>stuff like that,</v>

1278
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.720
<v Speaker 6>it's just the rollers to go for 20 tons.</v>

1279
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 6>What is the biggest block at Puma Puma?</v>

1280
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.063
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1281
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 6>one stands at 125 tons.</v>

1282
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 6>And just for reference,</v>

1283
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.373
<v Speaker 6>fucking Christ</v>

1284
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 6>one ton is 2000,</v>

1285
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 6>200 pounds.</v>

1286
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.230
<v Speaker 6>So you do the math.</v>

1287
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 6>I can't do the math that hurts my head.</v>

1288
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.400
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1289
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.610
<v Speaker 6>A hundred tons.</v>

1290
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.970
<v Speaker 6>And that's not even in,</v>

1291
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.813
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1292
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:03.920
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1293
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 6>in Baalbek Lebanon,</v>

1294
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:07.180
<v Speaker 6>we have a stone that's 1000,</v>

1295
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 6>250 tons.</v>

1296
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.300
<v Speaker 6>What else?</v>

1297
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:10.691
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

1298
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 6>Heliopolis and it's not on the floor.</v>

1299
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 6>It's on actually the third level of,</v>

1300
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:14.880
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1301
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.181
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1302
00:39:15.181 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

1303
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 6>of stone stone rose.</v>

1304
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:17.681
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1305
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:18.370
<v Speaker 6>and so,</v>

1306
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.203
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1307
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 6>and we're being told that our ancestors did this allegedly with chicken bones</v>

1308
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:24.220
<v Speaker 6>and with dental floss.</v>

1309
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.820
<v Speaker 6>So know I do agree with,</v>

1310
00:39:28.821 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

1311
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 6>with two ideas.</v>

1312
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 6>Either it had to have to do with extra terrestrials,</v>

1313
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 6>not that the extra terrestrials themselves build it,</v>

1314
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 6>but that our ancestors had help from them.</v>

1315
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 6>That's the big differentiation between the theory of the idea.</v>

1316
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.350
<v Speaker 6>So even if they had a super advanced civil war,</v>

1317
00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:44.680
<v Speaker 6>he was a super civilization.</v>

1318
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 6>Exactly that.</v>

1319
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 6>Then somehow by media rights or whatever got wiped out.</v>

1320
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:50.680
<v Speaker 6>So what we need to wrap our heads around those.</v>

1321
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 6>If it was a super advanced civilization,</v>

1322
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Speaker 6>it was really more advanced than us.</v>

1323
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:56.560
<v Speaker 6>Oh sure.</v>

1324
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 6>When you look at their actual construction methods and what they could do when</v>

1325
00:39:59.711 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1326
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.391
<v Speaker 6>you look at that,</v>

1327
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 6>just just what we know,</v>

1328
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.540
<v Speaker 6>they have dated very accurately,</v>

1329
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 6>the construction of the Pyramids to 2,500 BC.</v>

1330
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.730
<v Speaker 6>There are really positive about that.</v>

1331
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.520
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1332
00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:10.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1333
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Speaker 6>taken all these different samples from different parts of it.</v>

1334
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 6>So just back then,</v>

1335
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.783
<v Speaker 6>just back then,</v>

1336
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.220
<v Speaker 6>2,500 fucking years ago,</v>

1337
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 6>something existed,</v>

1338
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:24.250
<v Speaker 6>some sort of technology that allowed these motherfuckers to calculate so</v>

1339
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:24.971
<v Speaker 6>perfectly,</v>

1340
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 6>they could put 2 million,</v>

1341
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:27.880
<v Speaker 6>300,000 stones,</v>

1342
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.950
<v Speaker 6>all of them coming to a point,</v>

1343
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.640
<v Speaker 6>the covered and smooth lines to what the fuck were they using?</v>

1344
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:34.610
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1345
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.310
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck are these guys using?</v>

1346
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 6>We don't have a clue.</v>

1347
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:38.770
<v Speaker 6>We literally don't have a clue.</v>

1348
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 6>So for us to wrap our heads around the idea of like,</v>

1349
00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:44.350
<v Speaker 6>well that's preposterous.</v>

1350
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:47.590
<v Speaker 6>Why would you think that aliens had something to do with it?</v>

1351
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 6>Because even if they were an advanced civilization that were wiped out,</v>

1352
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.800
<v Speaker 6>they were way more advanced than us.</v>

1353
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.330
<v Speaker 6>Like freaky shit.</v>

1354
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

1355
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.531
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1356
00:40:56.531 --> 00:40:56.741
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

1357
00:40:56.741 --> 00:40:57.880
<v Speaker 6>and I truly think that,</v>

1358
00:40:57.881 --> 00:40:58.241
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1359
00:40:58.241 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 6>especially when you look at some of the ancient texts,</v>

1360
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:01.301
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1361
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:05.680
<v Speaker 6>cause a lot of times the ancient alien theory is attacked for being,</v>

1362
00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1363
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.850
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1364
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.550
<v Speaker 6>one way of undermining human ingenuity.</v>

1365
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.820
<v Speaker 6>And in a way I understand the,</v>

1366
00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:13.211
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1367
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:13.510
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1368
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.380
<v Speaker 6>the upset.</v>

1369
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:15.460
<v Speaker 6>But at the same time,</v>

1370
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.200
<v Speaker 6>what I always say is,</v>

1371
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.063
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1372
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.370
<v Speaker 6>if we were to subscribe to the ideas that our ancestors wrote on paper or you</v>

1373
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:25.411
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

1374
00:41:25.411 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 6>I had in their oral traditions or whatever else,</v>

1375
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 6>then they themselves actually said that they did have help.</v>

1376
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.800
<v Speaker 6>And for us to say today</v>

1377
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.761
<v Speaker 7>they did that,</v>

1378
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 7>they did it all themselves because they even said that they had help.</v>

1379
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1380
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.450
<v Speaker 7>who's really insulting whom here because you know,</v>

1381
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 7>they're saying the gods came from the sky and they all speak of things like the</v>

1382
00:41:47.751 --> 00:41:52.751
<v Speaker 7>Nephilim or the Anakie and it's always someone came from the sky.</v>

1383
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 7>But it could have been so bad.</v>

1384
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 7>Motherfuckers that lived in the other part of the world that had,</v>

1385
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.170
<v Speaker 7>they had spaceships are ready and they were flying around earth and space ships.</v>

1386
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 7>Could that,</v>

1387
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.951
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1388
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:01.761
<v Speaker 7>is that possible?</v>

1389
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:04.400
<v Speaker 7>Like like make a an airplane,</v>

1390
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.430
<v Speaker 7>not a spaceship and an airplane that looks like a flying saucer.</v>

1391
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.300
<v Speaker 7>Could we do that today?</v>

1392
00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.150
<v Speaker 7>Probably red bull people have seem to do it.</v>

1393
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 7>Or maybe just like some super advanced dudes would come down and maybe you know</v>

1394
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.320
<v Speaker 7>there was like one of those things where people go to the Amazon,</v>

1395
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:17.511
<v Speaker 7>I go,</v>

1396
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 7>this is a TV,</v>

1397
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 7>you know like cause that,</v>

1398
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 7>because that happens today that go to the Amazon and they'll still apparently</v>

1399
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 7>according to Sam Sheridan did he say they still have uncontacted tribes when he</v>

1400
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:28.470
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>

1401
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:31.480
<v Speaker 7>he had spent some time in the ambulance and he said there was few.</v>

1402
00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:32.720
<v Speaker 7>So I don't,</v>

1403
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if they were 100% sure about that because I had recently read about</v>

1404
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 7>one that they contacted that was a hoax.</v>

1405
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.911
<v Speaker 7>There has to be done.</v>

1406
00:42:39.911 --> 00:42:40.271
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's,</v>

1407
00:42:40.271 --> 00:42:40.671
<v Speaker 7>it's a big,</v>

1408
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:44.850
<v Speaker 7>those pictures that came out about three years ago where the helicopter window</v>

1409
00:42:44.851 --> 00:42:46.900
<v Speaker 7>with the tribe and they tried to hit hit the,</v>

1410
00:42:46.901 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 7>the helicopter was spears.</v>

1411
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.460
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.293
<v Speaker 7>They were always all,</v>

1413
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.500
<v Speaker 7>it was all pretty considerate.</v>

1414
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.590
<v Speaker 7>Painted red.</v>

1415
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1416
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.143
<v Speaker 7>They look dope.</v>

1417
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.200
<v Speaker 7>It was your volume.</v>

1418
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 7>But I mean,</v>

1419
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.920
<v Speaker 7>but this whole idea you see is based on what ethnology is referred to as a cargo</v>

1420
00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:00.854
<v Speaker 7>cult,</v>

1421
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.790
<v Speaker 7>where if a technologically primitive society gets in contact with a</v>

1422
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:06.830
<v Speaker 7>technologically advanced society,</v>

1423
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 7>that technologically Primitive Society perceives that technologically advanced</v>

1424
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:13.910
<v Speaker 7>society as being God's,</v>

1425
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:14.744
<v Speaker 7>God's,</v>

1426
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 7>which they're not.</v>

1427
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 7>I mean they're only from a perception standpoint,</v>

1428
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Speaker 7>gods,</v>

1429
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.980
<v Speaker 7>but not really from an actual stance.</v>

1430
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.751
<v Speaker 7>So real mind,</v>

1431

1432
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean this month is slab.</v>

1433
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 7>If you haven't seen this in [inaudible] Bay,</v>

1434
00:43:35.271 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 7>there's this huge,</v>

1435
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:39.330
<v Speaker 7>I guess what would you call it?</v>

1436
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 7>Mural?</v>

1437
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.151
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1438
00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:40.560
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1439
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:40.820
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

1440
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 7>it's a sarcophagus list.</v>

1441
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.321
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1442
00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:42.930
<v Speaker 7>It's a lid.</v>

1443
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 7>A Lid.</v>

1444
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:43.911
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

1445
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:46.930
<v Speaker 7>But it's all carved in one giant piece of stone apps.</v>

1446
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:47.360
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1447
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:47.841
<v Speaker 7>And it,</v>

1448
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 7>the image is a man who is in a like an astronaut seat before you continue</v>

1449
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 7>through every bus.</v>

1450
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.840
<v Speaker 7>Anybody can go online and just type in Palenque k slap,</v>

1451
00:43:56.841 --> 00:43:57.171
<v Speaker 7>p.</v>

1452
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 7>A.</v>

1453
00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 7>L.</v>

1454
00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 7>E.</v>

1455
00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 7>N.</v>

1456
00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 7>Q.</v>

1457
00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 7>U.</v>

1458
00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.481
<v Speaker 7>E.</v>

1459
00:43:59.481 --> 00:44:00.740
<v Speaker 7>So while we talk about it,</v>

1460
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.940
<v Speaker 7>you should check it out because you're,</v>

1461
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.610
<v Speaker 7>you're looking in my opinion at a,</v>

1462
00:44:04.611 --> 00:44:05.331
<v Speaker 7>at some type of,</v>

1463
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 7>of uh,</v>

1464
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.830
<v Speaker 7>an aerial vehicle.</v>

1465
00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:07.041
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1466
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:07.731
<v Speaker 7>The guy is,</v>

1467
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:09.410
<v Speaker 7>he's working pedals folks.</v>

1468
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 7>He's got it,</v>

1469
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.280
<v Speaker 7>he's got a shift lever or something and it looks like he's looking through</v>

1470
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:14.114
<v Speaker 7>optics.</v>

1471
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.661
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1472
00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 7>or he has some type of a breathing thing attached to his,</v>

1473
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 7>knows something's going on,</v>

1474
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.850
<v Speaker 7>something's going on.</v>

1475
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:25.270
<v Speaker 7>And he is reclined like in the same position like modern day astronauts when</v>

1476
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:27.860
<v Speaker 7>they launch into space.</v>

1477
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1478
00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 7>there reclined and uh,</v>

1479
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.060
<v Speaker 7>he's wearing some really bizarre clothes and</v>

1480
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 6>on the outside you see this,</v>

1481
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:35.750
<v Speaker 6>he sits insight.</v>

1482
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.410
<v Speaker 6>This contraption that looks like almost like a bell shape and the at the bottom</v>

1483
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:41.244
<v Speaker 6>of it,</v>

1484
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.830
<v Speaker 6>if you look closely on one end,</v>

1485
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 6>at the bottom of this machine,</v>

1486
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.840
<v Speaker 6>there is as if there's a carving that looks like and then exhaust flame or</v>

1487
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:52.260
<v Speaker 6>something like this.</v>

1488
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:56.870
<v Speaker 6>And it's fascinating and archeologists are interpreting this as um,</v>

1489
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1490
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 6>king precall on his journey to the underworld and things like this.</v>

1491
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 6>And Linda Sheely right before she died,</v>

1492
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 6>she did,</v>

1493
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.653
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1494
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.220
<v Speaker 6>she translated the glyphs,</v>

1495
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 6>the band of glyphs that's around the slab,</v>

1496
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1497
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.810
<v Speaker 6>in the sixties and seventies.</v>

1498
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 6>She translated as king per Carl's journey to the underworld.</v>

1499
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.690
<v Speaker 6>And you can see how is swallowed up by the underground monster and things like</v>

1500
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

1501
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 6>But before Linda died,</v>

1502
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 6>she said that I would like to change my opinion about one translation I made and</v>

1503
00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:32.070
<v Speaker 6>she made a few changes,</v>

1504
00:45:32.071 --> 00:45:34.050
<v Speaker 6>but one that she was very particular about,</v>

1505
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.710
<v Speaker 6>she said that she made a mistake by suggesting that this was king per Kyle's</v>

1506
00:45:38.711 --> 00:45:42.900
<v Speaker 6>journey into the underworld because she said that the word she baba,</v>

1507
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.130
<v Speaker 6>which is underworld,</v>

1508
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.660
<v Speaker 6>can have two meanings.</v>

1509
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 6>And the second meeting she said,</v>

1510
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 6>which he is more convinced about is the word Milky Way.</v>

1511
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.290
<v Speaker 6>So what we have five George.</v>

1512
00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:00.140
<v Speaker 6>And so what we have here is a depiction of King [inaudible] journey to the Milky</v>

1513
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:02.090
<v Speaker 6>Way.</v>

1514
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 6>How amazing is that?</v>

1515
00:46:03.241 --> 00:46:04.074
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1516
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:04.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1517
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:08.010
<v Speaker 6>in one way the ancient alien theory has set this all along.</v>

1518
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:11.460
<v Speaker 6>That what we're looking at here is some type of a vehicle,</v>

1519
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1520
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 6>some shuttle craft with which to go to the mothership or whatever,</v>

1521
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.960
<v Speaker 6>or an actual spaceship.</v>

1522
00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.550
<v Speaker 6>Who knows,</v>

1523
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.800
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1524
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 6>Because one thing I would like to make very clear,</v>

1525
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.970
<v Speaker 6>none of these things that we look at today,</v>

1526
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.290
<v Speaker 6>the pyramids,</v>

1527
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.150
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1528
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.440
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1529
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.710
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1530
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 6>the [inaudible] that we're looking at here,</v>

1531
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.170
<v Speaker 6>none of the ancient archeological sites,</v>

1532
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.550
<v Speaker 6>none of that stuff.</v>

1533
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.330
<v Speaker 6>Please.</v>

1534
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.400
<v Speaker 6>None of it was built by aliens.</v>

1535
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 6>It was all built by human beings.</v>

1536
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:38.850
<v Speaker 6>There's absolutely no question in my mind.</v>

1537
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 6>But as the ancient,</v>

1538
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1539
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 6>our ancestors said it was all built,</v>

1540
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 6>most of it,</v>

1541
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:50.760
<v Speaker 6>the great majority was built with the help of the gods.</v>

1542
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 6>There in lies the difference.</v>

1543
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.820
<v Speaker 6>I have never said,</v>

1544
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:54.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1545
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.193
<v Speaker 6>that hey,</v>

1546
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:55.551
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1547
00:46:55.551 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 6>aliens built the pyramids.</v>

1548
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 6>It's total nonsense to suggest such a thing.</v>

1549
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.810
<v Speaker 6>Of course he was humans who did it,</v>

1550
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:06.020
<v Speaker 6>but they themselves said that we've had help and he was this magical stuff that</v>

1551
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:12.060
<v Speaker 6>they gave us with which we were able to move to stones and things like that.</v>

1552
00:47:12.061 --> 00:47:12.520
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1553
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:12.750
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1554
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.040
<v Speaker 6>and we're looking at it from a modern day perspective and,</v>

1555
00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 6>and see,</v>

1556
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1557
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 6>what were they really trying to tell us?</v>

1558
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 6>It's a real good point that you made about people saying that,</v>

1559
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:22.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1560
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.190
<v Speaker 6>you don't give enough credit to human ingenuity and that,</v>

1561
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:27.024
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1562
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.650
<v Speaker 6>to really give credit to these people,</v>

1563
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 6>you have to listen to what the fuck they said.</v>

1564
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.641
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1565
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:32.710
<v Speaker 6>And if there's a lot of photos or excuse me,</v>

1566
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:32.891
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1567
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:37.891
<v Speaker 6>paintings from ancient times that show and like classic ancient paintings that</v>

1568
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 6>show people in what looks like a flying fucking spaceship.</v>

1569
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.533
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

1570
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:44.441
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1571
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 6>to me the whole thing is,</v>

1572
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 6>is absolutely it's,</v>

1573
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1574
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 6>it's almost,</v>

1575
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:50.381
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1576
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:50.981
<v Speaker 6>not almost,</v>

1577
00:47:50.981 --> 00:47:55.981
<v Speaker 6>but it is insulting because we have to remind ourselves that when writing was</v>

1578
00:47:57.221 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 6>invented for the very first time,</v>

1579
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 6>imagine for yourself,</v>

1580
00:48:00.641 --> 00:48:00.851
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

1581
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 6>for a moment in all of our listeners,</v>

1582
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 6>imagine if you've never,</v>

1583
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:05.531
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

1584
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 6>if you've lived now 30 years of your life,</v>

1585
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 6>but in all those 30 years he didn't know how to write.</v>

1586
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.410
<v Speaker 6>And then all of a sudden overnight you learn how to write.</v>

1587
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 6>What's the first thing you're going to write down?</v>

1588
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 6>You're going to write down your name,</v>

1589
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:19.990
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna write down your wife's name,</v>

1590
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna write down your kid's name when they were born,</v>

1591
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:22.894
<v Speaker 6>this and that.</v>

1592
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.460
<v Speaker 6>And then after that you will tell other things that happen to you that were</v>

1593
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:28.360
<v Speaker 6>significant.</v>

1594
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.900
<v Speaker 6>So you're not going to lie in your first ever recording of,</v>

1595
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1596
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:34.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1597
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:35.850
<v Speaker 6>knowing how to write.</v>

1598
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.700
<v Speaker 6>It's possible.</v>

1599
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 6>But it's also possible that people have always been full of shit.</v>

1600
00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:40.990
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as they figured out how to talk to figure,</v>

1601
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:41.291
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

1602
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:42.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't have to tell the truth and get in trouble.</v>

1603
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:43.140
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1604
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 6>Just make some shit up.</v>

1605
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.640
<v Speaker 6>Dot is that is correct.</v>

1606
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:46.040
<v Speaker 6>But as,</v>

1607
00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.840
<v Speaker 6>and I'm sorry,</v>

1608
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm hearing some weird like crackling.</v>

1609
00:48:49.131 --> 00:48:50.230
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that's my headset?</v>

1610
00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.850
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's not connected,</v>

1611
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:52.061
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1612
00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:52.481
<v Speaker 6>Or something.</v>

1613
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:53.500
<v Speaker 6>It feels like maybe I,</v>

1614
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.513
<v Speaker 6>maybe it's off.</v>

1615
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:55.503
<v Speaker 6>Is it connected right?</v>

1616
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1617
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.240
<v Speaker 6>Now it's kind of like some crazy noise.</v>

1618
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 6>It's got a yes.</v>

1619
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:00.131
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1620
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:02.950
<v Speaker 6>Let me see if maybe it's not connected over here.</v>

1621
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:03.690
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

1622
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:04.940
<v Speaker 6>What were you in the middle of saying?</v>

1623
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:06.791
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>

1624
00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:07.240
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1625
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:07.541
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1626
00:49:07.541 --> 00:49:12.541
<v Speaker 6>writing at at the back in the day was a new invention and so I disagreed at our</v>

1627
00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 6>ancestors that all they did was sit around a campfire,</v>

1628
00:49:19.181 --> 00:49:23.710
<v Speaker 6>smoking dope and getting drunk and coming up with fantasy stories because every</v>

1629
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:28.711
<v Speaker 6>psychologist and psychiatrist will tell you that no idea can come about without</v>

1630
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 6>a spark of inspiration and you know,</v>

1631
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 6>you doing your acts and stuff,</v>

1632
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:34.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1633
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 6>you're always inspired by stuff that's happening in your life.</v>

1634
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.370
<v Speaker 6>If nothing would have happened in your life,</v>

1635
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:40.810
<v Speaker 6>where would you get your material from?</v>

1636
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.540
<v Speaker 6>Material from if you were to live in a vacuum.</v>

1637
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.840
<v Speaker 6>So that's what they're suggesting is that these ancient stories,</v>

1638
00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 6>especially the further we go back in time,</v>

1639
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:55.290
<v Speaker 6>that the likelihood of them being nonsense or figments of our ancestors</v>

1640
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Speaker 6>imagination are very,</v>

1641
00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:00.310
<v Speaker 6>very slim.</v>

1642
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 6>That they actually saw something that's so far superseded their technological</v>

1643
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 6>frame of reference,</v>

1644
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.520
<v Speaker 6>that they tried to describe stuff,</v>

1645
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.340
<v Speaker 6>what they saw with the words they knew,</v>

1646
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:17.410
<v Speaker 6>they didn't have the vocabulary to describe an actual spaceship with.</v>

1647
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.120
<v Speaker 6>It's uh,</v>

1648
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:18.521
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1649
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:19.400
<v Speaker 6>airlines and,</v>

1650
00:50:19.401 --> 00:50:21.250
<v Speaker 6>and whatever those names are.</v>

1651
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 6>And Airlines.</v>

1652
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.110
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1653
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 6>the um,</v>

1654
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.001
<v Speaker 6>how do you call the,</v>

1655
00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:25.834
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1656
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.093
<v Speaker 6>it's on the back,</v>

1657
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 6>a w of the wing of planes.</v>

1658
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 6>Ailerons Stanson ailerons day.</v>

1659
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 6>They make the plane go up and down.</v>

1660
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 6>They don't have the specific jargon for these specific things.</v>

1661
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 6>So then they look at that stuff and because the Aileron is moving,</v>

1662
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:41.990
<v Speaker 6>they think,</v>

1663
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.651
<v Speaker 6>holy crap,</v>

1664
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 6>that thing must be alive.</v>

1665
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 6>And then they turned this whole thing into a bird or something like this.</v>

1666
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.870
<v Speaker 6>And so all of a sudden we have birds.</v>

1667
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 6>Made of metal in ancient texts that make a lot of noise when they fly around.</v>

1668
00:50:55.881 --> 00:51:00.140
<v Speaker 6>But what's a one of my favorite passages from the Bible?</v>

1669
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.921
<v Speaker 6>One of my favorite,</v>

1670
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:04.390
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck pastures is the whole depiction by Ezekiel?</v>

1671
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1672
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 6>Of the wheel within a wheel.</v>

1673
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:09.810
<v Speaker 6>This fly he's talking about like what is the actual dino,</v>

1674
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:12.320
<v Speaker 6>do you know the actual quote cause oh no,</v>

1675
00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:12.501
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1676
00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 6>it's not an actual quote.</v>

1677
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 6>It's actual quote from the box versus upon versus it's a,</v>

1678
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:19.081
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1679
00:51:19.081 --> 00:51:21.520
<v Speaker 6>it goes on and entirely through the,</v>

1680
00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:21.940
<v Speaker 6>there's the,</v>

1681
00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.890
<v Speaker 6>there's two books to the book of [inaudible],</v>

1682
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 6>first part and the second part.</v>

1683
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:26.970
<v Speaker 6>And in the first part is he killed,</v>

1684
00:51:26.971 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 6>describes this thing that he sees,</v>

1685
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 6>not while he's asleep,</v>

1686
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:33.020
<v Speaker 6>but while he's actually awake.</v>

1687
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.110
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1688
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:34.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1689
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.650
<v Speaker 6>it descends in front of men.</v>

1690
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 6>He refers to it as the glory of the Lord.</v>

1691
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.350
<v Speaker 6>And he says that,</v>

1692
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:39.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1693
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:40.790
<v Speaker 6>as it approached,</v>

1694
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:45.790
<v Speaker 6>it was as if he was hearing a thousand waterfalls and the earth shook and the</v>

1695
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:48.520
<v Speaker 6>wind and sand came into the air and the,</v>

1696
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 6>there was an earthquake and just,</v>

1697
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.811
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1698
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 6>he was trembling and he fell to the ground in awe because he was being visited</v>

1699
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:57.290
<v Speaker 6>by quote unquote God.</v>

1700
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1701
00:51:59.360 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1702
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 6>it basically,</v>

1703
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.731
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1704
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:02.190
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1705
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 6>the question then is,</v>

1706
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.910
<v Speaker 6>since when would god need a vehicle to get from point a to point B?</v>

1707
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 6>And of course this is straight out of star trek five,</v>

1708
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.110
<v Speaker 6>the unknown country.</v>

1709
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:12.831
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1710
00:52:12.831 --> 00:52:14.570
<v Speaker 6>where the idea was,</v>

1711
00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 6>why would god ever need a via Colby?</v>

1712
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.420
<v Speaker 6>God can create things,</v>

1713
00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 6>but he actually still has to walk around.</v>

1714
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.033
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1715
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 6>maybe he's like totally bad ass,</v>

1716
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:23.661
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1717
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:24.920
<v Speaker 6>he can't like fly or anything.</v>

1718
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1719
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 6>Needs to make a spaceship.</v>

1720
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.590
<v Speaker 6>Now what's really cool about the whole is equal story is that this NASA</v>

1721
00:52:30.591 --> 00:52:32.460
<v Speaker 6>scientist by the name of Joseph Bloom,</v>

1722
00:52:32.461 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 6>Rick,</v>

1723
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.770
<v Speaker 6>he wrote a book called a space,</v>

1724
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 6>a space ships of Ezekiel in which there's NASA scientists.</v>

1725
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:39.920
<v Speaker 6>This rocket scientist,</v>

1726
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.160
<v Speaker 6>he looks at the biblical passages in the book of Ezekiel and he went to the</v>

1727
00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 6>drawing board and he actually created this upside down cone shaped,</v>

1728
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.790
<v Speaker 6>you have pho type flying saucer.</v>

1729
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.160
<v Speaker 6>But how can he do that from those depictions?</v>

1730
00:52:55.161 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 6>Cause if depictions are so cryptic,</v>

1731
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:57.741
<v Speaker 6>well of course,</v>

1732
00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:58.790
<v Speaker 6>and that is why,</v>

1733
00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1734
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:04.230
<v Speaker 6>he actually approached this whole idea trying to debunk Eric fun.</v>

1735
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:05.063
<v Speaker 6>Danny can,</v>

1736
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.511
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1737
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 6>at a lecture that Eric gave in Huntsville,</v>

1738
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 6>Alabama at the NASA,</v>

1739
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.410
<v Speaker 6>the NASA headquarters expert explained people who don't know Eric von Danna,</v>

1740
00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:15.651
<v Speaker 6>Ken,</v>

1741
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:17.560
<v Speaker 6>he's came up with that,</v>

1742
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 6>the book and the movie chariots of the Gods.</v>

1743
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.060
<v Speaker 6>And that was in the 1970s.</v>

1744
00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:23.421
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1745
00:53:23.421 --> 00:53:23.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1746
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:24.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1747
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.810
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1748
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:29.810
<v Speaker 6>viewers off the ancient alien theory recognize Eric with the gray hair and the</v>

1749
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:31.021
<v Speaker 6>blue suit.</v>

1750
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:32.060
<v Speaker 6>That's Eric [inaudible].</v>

1751
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:37.070
<v Speaker 6>And he basically launched the whole ancient alien craze in the 70s.</v>

1752
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.701
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1753
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1754
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:39.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1755
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.150
<v Speaker 6>there was a bit of a lull,</v>

1756
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 6>sort of the 80s into the 90s,</v>

1757
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.260
<v Speaker 6>and we own a business and now it's booming kids.</v>

1758
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.061
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1759
00:53:47.061 --> 00:53:47.311
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1760
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 6>but it's just fascinating that,</v>

1761
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1762
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.700
<v Speaker 6>he is still around and he has just completed writing book number 34.</v>

1763
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.481
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1764
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 6>Chariots of the gods.</v>

1765
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

1766
00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.331
<v Speaker 6>anybody who says,</v>

1767
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1768
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 6>is he still around?</v>

1769
00:53:58.891 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 6>He's still alive.</v>

1770
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:00.371
<v Speaker 6>Of course he is.</v>

1771
00:54:00.371 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 6>And he's a pro.</v>

1772
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 6>He's more prolific than ever before.</v>

1773
00:54:02.941 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 6>I mean writing 35 books.</v>

1774
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:07.080
<v Speaker 6>What is the latest [inaudible] roller skates of the wizards?</v>

1775
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:07.531
<v Speaker 6>How many,</v>

1776
00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:11.910
<v Speaker 6>how many books can you write about the same subject lamps up to God or whatever.</v>

1777
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.631
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>

1778
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:13.140
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1779
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1780
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 6>to me it's just fascinating that,</v>

1781
00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:15.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1782
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.370
<v Speaker 6>this proves that this is not just something that he thinks I can just sell a</v>

1783
00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:20.971
<v Speaker 6>couple of books,</v>

1784
00:54:20.971 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 6>but he genuinely believes this stuff.</v>

1785
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:24.390
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise he wouldn't,</v>

1786
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you know that you would still do this after</v>

1787
00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.031
<v Speaker 4>44.</v>

1788
00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:28.370
<v Speaker 4>What have,</v>

1789
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:32.200
<v Speaker 4>you would certainly do it if it was part of your culture and you know,</v>

1790
00:54:32.201 --> 00:54:33.130
<v Speaker 4>as part of your,</v>

1791
00:54:33.131 --> 00:54:33.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1792
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.390
<v Speaker 4>your social circle,</v>

1793
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1794
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:37.311
<v Speaker 4>he lives in,</v>

1795
00:54:37.311 --> 00:54:38.350
<v Speaker 4>you might not believe it.</v>

1796
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.380
<v Speaker 4>He lives in Switzerland.</v>

1797
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.230
<v Speaker 4>They're very anti Ufo over there.</v>

1798
00:54:41.231 --> 00:54:43.600
<v Speaker 4>So I believe he believes it.</v>

1799
00:54:43.601 --> 00:54:45.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not necessarily sure that he's right,</v>

1800
00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:48.730
<v Speaker 4>but I believe that he believes it when I watch it though,</v>

1801
00:54:48.731 --> 00:54:51.070
<v Speaker 4>it's an amazing documentary still to this day.</v>

1802
00:54:51.071 --> 00:54:51.904
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

1803
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.910
<v Speaker 4>What's incredible about chariots of the gods is the shit that you cannot fuck</v>

1804
00:54:54.911 --> 00:54:55.480
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

1805
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.480
<v Speaker 4>I got in an argument when I first came to California and not an argument,</v>

1806
00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I was dressed down by a reporter character.</v>

1807
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:02.440
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about,</v>

1808
00:55:02.441 --> 00:55:02.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1809
00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1810
00:55:03.161 --> 00:55:05.170
<v Speaker 4>a Ufo and somehow or another he asked me,</v>

1811
00:55:05.171 --> 00:55:06.100
<v Speaker 4>do you believe in Ufos?</v>

1812
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.270
<v Speaker 4>And I always pretty much have said the same thing when I was younger.</v>

1813
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:11.740
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to believe them for sure.</v>

1814
00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.570
<v Speaker 4>I said most likely they probably exist,</v>

1815
00:55:13.571 --> 00:55:14.160
<v Speaker 4>but who knows.</v>

1816
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:14.340
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

1817
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.910
<v Speaker 4>my thing has always been who knows?</v>

1818
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:16.780
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1819
00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:17.081
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1820
00:55:17.081 --> 00:55:17.980
<v Speaker 4>well what evidence,</v>

1821
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.340
<v Speaker 4>what evidence have you ever seen that makes you think that it's possible?</v>

1822
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:21.881
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1823
00:55:21.881 --> 00:55:22.001
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1824
00:55:22.001 --> 00:55:23.290

1827
00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:26.524
<v Speaker 4>It was so funny.</v>

1828
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's been deep.</v>

1829
00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.830
<v Speaker 4>Bunked are you kidding me?</v>

1830
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Are you a child with your information?</v>

1831
00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:33.491
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1832
00:55:33.491 --> 00:55:33.601
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1833
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:37.900
<v Speaker 4>What has been debunked about those monsters structures that we can recreate</v>

1834
00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:38.470
<v Speaker 4>today?</v>

1835
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.720
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1836
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.060
<v Speaker 4>what has be debunked about,</v>

1837
00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:40.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1838
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:40.991
<v Speaker 4>but people don't,</v>

1839
00:55:40.991 --> 00:55:41.450
<v Speaker 4>even my,</v>

1840
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:46.270
<v Speaker 4>my wife went to a college for She Greek history and that was her major.</v>

1841
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:48.790
<v Speaker 4>And so she's fascinated by like ancient Greece and shit.</v>

1842
00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.260
<v Speaker 4>She was talking about the Acropolis,</v>

1843
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:50.981
<v Speaker 4>the Parthenon,</v>

1844
00:55:50.981 --> 00:55:51.220
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1845
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.680
<v Speaker 4>What people don't understand about the Parthenon is the top one,</v>

1846
00:55:53.681 --> 00:55:54.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1847
00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:54.581
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1848
00:55:54.581 --> 00:55:55.930
<v Speaker 4>It's built on the Acropolis.</v>

1849
00:55:55.931 --> 00:56:00.931
<v Speaker 4>The Acropolis is fucking monster stones that no one even bothers to explain.</v>

1850
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:03.820
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>

1851
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:04.061
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1852
00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:04.451
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1853
00:56:04.451 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 4>some they were,</v>

1854
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.023
<v Speaker 4>it was already there.</v>

1855
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.390
<v Speaker 6>You just walk up it and people don't even realize what they're walking by.</v>

1856
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.880
<v Speaker 6>You are walking by something that's impossible.</v>

1857
00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:14.401
<v Speaker 6>Like you,</v>

1858
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:16.220
<v Speaker 6>you are stepping on something that's impossible.</v>

1859
00:56:16.221 --> 00:56:17.180
<v Speaker 6>It's sacred ground.</v>

1860
00:56:17.181 --> 00:56:21.010
<v Speaker 6>Just like Heliopolis in Lebanon or Bowel Beck.</v>

1861
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1862
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.513
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1863
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Speaker 6>they consider it a Roman temple today,</v>

1864
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:26.171
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1865
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:29.320
<v Speaker 6>the Romans only took over after the Greeks and after the Greeks to over and so</v>

1866
00:56:29.321 --> 00:56:30.154
<v Speaker 6>on and so forth.</v>

1867
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.450
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1868
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.493
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1869
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:38.160
<v Speaker 6>they don't know it's the biggest Roman temple outside of the Roman empire or</v>

1870
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 6>outside of Rome.</v>

1871
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.073
<v Speaker 6>And the question is,</v>

1872
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't the biggest temple I've been in Rome,</v>

1873
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:48.220
<v Speaker 6>and the truth is that it wasn't because they knew what happened at Heliopolis</v>

1874
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 6>thousands of years ago.</v>

1875
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 6>It was sacred.</v>

1876
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 6>It's a sacred space like the Acropolis were allegedly a long time ago,</v>

1877
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 6>Zeus himself to send it from the sky.</v>

1878
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.410
<v Speaker 6>She zoos also descended from the sky at Heliopolis in Lebanon.</v>

1879
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.680
<v Speaker 6>So it's so fascinating that we have all these similar stories that all day back</v>

1880
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 6>to about the same time.</v>

1881
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.590
<v Speaker 6>The bottom line is if you watch that movie,</v>

1882
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 6>if you look at,</v>

1883
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.420
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1884
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 6>the chariots of the gods,</v>

1885
00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 6>the book,</v>

1886
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.350
<v Speaker 6>if you look at any of these structures that you brought up,</v>

1887
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 6>this Poma punk who there's some fucking questions,</v>

1888
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:24.790
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1889
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:25.623
<v Speaker 6>They are some,</v>

1890
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.660
<v Speaker 6>you cannot say that this is an a mystery.</v>

1891
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1892
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 6>this is a mass.</v>

1893
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 6>And especially,</v>

1894
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 6>especially if we,</v>

1895
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 6>if we are to believe what the archeologists are doing that a block of stone,</v>

1896
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 6>like this was a,</v>

1897
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:38.981
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1898
00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:42.910
<v Speaker 6>cut with copper tools or with chicken bones and then they pulled it with dental</v>

1899
00:57:42.911 --> 00:57:43.630
<v Speaker 6>floss.</v>

1900
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.931
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1901
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:47.200
<v Speaker 6>we have to also remain within the realms of physics.</v>

1902
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:52.500
<v Speaker 6>You cannot cut a granite stone with a chicken bones or with a copper tool or a</v>

1903
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:53.891
<v Speaker 6>bronze tool,</v>

1904
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 6>especially this per these perfect right angles.</v>

1905
00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 6>It's completely flat and smooth.</v>

1906
00:57:58.810 --> 00:57:58.961
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

1907
00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:03.400
<v Speaker 6>If you go and touch them with these edges and you apply a little bit of pressure</v>

1908
00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.260
<v Speaker 6>and you lower your thumb or your finger,</v>

1909
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.430
<v Speaker 6>you can cut yourself.</v>

1910
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:08.680
<v Speaker 6>That is how sharp those edges are.</v>

1911
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 6>And this,</v>

1912
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.241
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

1913
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 6>thousands of years after they were made,</v>

1914
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:14.100
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

1915
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:14.110
<v Speaker 6>thousand thousand.</v>

1916
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:14.590
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>

1917
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:15.070
<v Speaker 6>sure.</v>

1918
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:15.641
<v Speaker 6>We're talking,</v>

1919
00:58:15.641 --> 00:58:15.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1920
00:58:15.831 --> 00:58:16.310
<v Speaker 6>everybody's,</v>

1921
00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>

1922
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 6>we're talking at least 12 to 15,000 years.</v>

1923
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.960
<v Speaker 6>Even though the neighboring site,</v>

1924
00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 6>which is only 250 yards away from Puma,</v>

1925
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:26.980
<v Speaker 6>Pimco is Tiwa.</v>

1926
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.560
<v Speaker 6>Norco to knock was a world famous site in every day.</v>

1927
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 6>Tourists arrive there.</v>

1928
00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 6>They'd take pictures of the Gateway of the son,</v>

1929
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.880
<v Speaker 6>of all those different places,</v>

1930
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:37.301
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1931
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:38.440
<v Speaker 6>or or artifacts.</v>

1932
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 6>But nobody has told and only 250 yards away,</v>

1933
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 6>it's an even bigger mystery.</v>

1934
00:58:43.571 --> 00:58:44.404
<v Speaker 6>Puma Punko.</v>

1935
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.220
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

1936
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 6>there are thousands of glyphs that were found,</v>

1937
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of glyphs that were found at [inaudible] that have been translated.</v>

1938
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:55.830
<v Speaker 6>And they all say that this place exists to,</v>

1939
00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 6>and aqua exists only because of the events that happened at Puma,</v>

1940
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:00.130
<v Speaker 6>Puma.</v>

1941
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:02.920
<v Speaker 6>So it's a monument with God's descending from the sky.</v>

1942
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 6>It's a monument.</v>

1943
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:09.151
<v Speaker 6>It's a place of pilgrimage and according to those translations of whatever is on</v>

1944
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:11.590
<v Speaker 6>the backside of the Gateway of the sun,</v>

1945
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 6>that significant event are you guys ready for?</v>

1946
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:18.760
<v Speaker 6>This happened 28,000 years ago.</v>

1947
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:24.660
<v Speaker 6>But our are seeing stuff like this and they say our ancestors didn't know how to</v>

1948
00:59:26.361 --> 00:59:27.230
<v Speaker 6>keep records.</v>

1949
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:29.420
<v Speaker 6>They didn't know how to calculate their years.</v>

1950
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 6>They made mistakes,</v>

1951
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:31.550
<v Speaker 6>this and that,</v>

1952
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 6>like Noah was 600 years old.</v>

1953
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

1954
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1955
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.101
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1956
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 6>And so that is why,</v>

1957
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:36.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1958
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.500
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1959
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 6>we cannot pay any credence to,</v>

1960
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1961
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:39.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1962
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:40.671
<v Speaker 6>our ancestors.</v>

1963
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:42.170
<v Speaker 6>You'd be no was on HGH.</v>

1964
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:43.510
<v Speaker 6>Don't let,</v>

1965
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1966
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.211
<v Speaker 6>maybe no,</v>

1967
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:46.970
<v Speaker 6>it took vitamins and just went straight Jacko lane on.</v>

1968
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.980
<v Speaker 6>But this is the exact,</v>

1969
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:49.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1970
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 6>insult to our human ingenuity that I'm talking about because here we have these,</v>

1971
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:54.770
<v Speaker 6>this giant,</v>

1972
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:55.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1973
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:59.150
<v Speaker 6>gateway where someone or some artists painstakingly,</v>

1974
00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 6>you recorded this date and here we are today saying,</v>

1975
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 6>you didn't know what the hell you are doing.</v>

1976
01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:05.360
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1977
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.193
<v Speaker 6>that is,</v>

1978
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 6>it's very insulting to say that these people didn't know what they were talking</v>

1979
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:09.411
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

1980
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 6>but yet they were able to complete something that literally we can't do today</v>

1981
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 6>and mailing out when you say,</v>

1982
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:14.650
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

1983
01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:14.790
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1984
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 6>you broken.</v>

1985
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 6>Stop saying literally they can't do that.</v>

1986
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:22.660
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what kind of a monumental fucking construction company you would</v>

1987
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:28.631
<v Speaker 6>need to move a 1000 ton block bitch to cut and move 1000 tons.</v>

1988
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.410
<v Speaker 6>Our,</v>

1989
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 6>our cranes today,</v>

1990
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.983
<v Speaker 6>Peter out,</v>

1991
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>

1992
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 6>I might be mistaken,</v>

1993
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 6>but somebody told me this,</v>

1994
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 6>they Peter out at 1,350 tons,</v>

1995
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:40.840
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

1996
01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.673
<v Speaker 6>and they're done.</v>

1997
01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.470
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1998
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.011
<v Speaker 6>having that,</v>

1999
01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:44.890
<v Speaker 6>having that bell back stone or,</v>

2000
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 6>or having that,</v>

2001
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:46.230
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2002
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2003
01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.440
<v Speaker 6>cornerstone at Heliopolis,</v>

2004
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 6>that thing weighs 1000,</v>

2005
01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 6>250 tons.</v>

2006
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:53.560
<v Speaker 6>So w you know,</v>

2007
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 6>we're only 100 pounds,</v>

2008
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:56.190
<v Speaker 6>I mean 100 tons off.</v>

2009
01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:01.660
<v Speaker 6>But the thing is that this thing was created at least 8,000 years ago.</v>

2010
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.010
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2011
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2012
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.940
<v Speaker 6>to be told that this was all done with wooden rollers,</v>

2013
01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.331
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2014
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.560
<v Speaker 6>if it was a hundred years ago,</v>

2015
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.130
<v Speaker 6>imagine if we were told 200 years ago before the steam engine,</v>

2016
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.083
<v Speaker 6>because we have</v>

2017
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 6>no steam engine was more than 200 years,</v>

2018
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:17.900
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2019
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.800
<v Speaker 6>It's been a few hundred years.</v>

2020
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 6>So let's go 500 years ago.</v>

2021
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:22.400
<v Speaker 6>Could you imagine if we found out 500 years ago they did this?</v>

2022
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:23.151
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like,</v>

2023
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

2024
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.461
<v Speaker 6>And see and,</v>

2025
01:01:25.461 --> 01:01:26.090
<v Speaker 6>and that's,</v>

2026
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:26.630
<v Speaker 6>that's the,</v>

2027
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.560
<v Speaker 6>the thing to me that,</v>

2028
01:01:27.561 --> 01:01:27.801
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2029
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:30.350
<v Speaker 6>how can you even suggest such a thing?</v>

2030
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.183
<v Speaker 6>Because,</v>

2031
01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.473
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2032
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:34.610
<v Speaker 6>it's tricky because we have records,</v>

2033
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 6>but our records are really shitty.</v>

2034
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.121
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2035
01:01:37.121 --> 01:01:38.420
<v Speaker 6>like just looking at what we know,</v>

2036
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:39.630
<v Speaker 6>like we still stuffed,</v>

2037
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:41.390
<v Speaker 6>fucking just celebrate Columbus Day.</v>

2038
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.570
<v Speaker 6>This is why right now it's not,</v>

2039
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.090
<v Speaker 6>here's a water Bob behind your laptop.</v>

2040
01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:47.924
<v Speaker 6>It just fell over.</v>

2041
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.823
<v Speaker 6>Did it really?</v>

2042
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.950
<v Speaker 6>Jesus man's man,</v>

2043
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:51.950
<v Speaker 6>you could ruin my new Alienware.</v>

2044
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:54.820
<v Speaker 6>Laptops are telling the aliens would come down and fuck you out.</v>

2045
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.000
<v Speaker 6>It'll be replaced by an alien thing.</v>

2046
01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:57.970
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

2047
01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 6>but here's the thing that you know about us not keeping good records.</v>

2048
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:02.900
<v Speaker 6>We can't keep records,</v>

2049
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:04.010
<v Speaker 6>good records today.</v>

2050
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:05.360
<v Speaker 6>So how the hell did they do it?</v>

2051
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2052
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:06.850
<v Speaker 6>to kill Kennedy years.</v>

2053
01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:11.270
<v Speaker 6>And here's the thing that a lot of people are freaking out right now,</v>

2054
01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:13.400
<v Speaker 6>but the whole 2012 phenomenon that you know,</v>

2055
01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 6>in a 21st of December,</v>

2056
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 6>2012 [inaudible] world is gonna end.</v>

2057
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.000
<v Speaker 6>It's all bullshit,</v>

2058
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:17.430
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2059
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm just closing right now.</v>

2060
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 6>It's not even</v>

2061
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 7>2012 our calendar is off by at least a hundred years.</v>

2062
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:25.411
<v Speaker 7>But that's,</v>

2063
01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:25.591
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2064
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:28.800
<v Speaker 7>before I delve into this a hundred at least at least,</v>

2065
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:30.100
<v Speaker 7>and I'll give you the arguments in Islam,</v>

2066
01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.830
<v Speaker 7>not to Leo.</v>

2067
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:31.600
<v Speaker 7>Zoe tries to,</v>

2068
01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.170
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2069
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:32.311
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2070
01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:32.431
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2071
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:32.721
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

2072
01:02:32.721 --> 01:02:33.050
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

2073
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:33.883
<v Speaker 7>you're months,</v>

2074
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.390
<v Speaker 7>your months and your birth month is fine.</v>

2075
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 7>Just not the year.</v>

2076
01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 7>But the Mayan never suggested.</v>

2077
01:02:40.681 --> 01:02:44.040
<v Speaker 7>Not once that at the end of their calendar,</v>

2078
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 7>the world will end.</v>

2079
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:46.043
<v Speaker 7>That's all,</v>

2080
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2081
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 7>modern new age bullshit.</v>

2082
01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 7>This is my thought.</v>

2083
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:53.910
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of people that just love believing and like events that events are</v>

2084
01:02:53.911 --> 01:02:54.800
<v Speaker 7>coming love,</v>

2085
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:59.810
<v Speaker 7>like predicting things and the people that seem to be really into this are</v>

2086
01:03:00.091 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 7>people that feel like society cannot evolve.</v>

2087
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:07.890
<v Speaker 7>It has to be taken down and then we have to rebuild the society.</v>

2088
01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:08.724
<v Speaker 7>Like a community,</v>

2089
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 7>basically a lot of hippie cult type people that are looking to fuck your wife,</v>

2090
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.073
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2091
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 7>Survivalists and shit because with the thing is all always that they only said</v>

2092
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 7>that a cycle of time will end and after a calendar and when a calendar ends,</v>

2093
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:24.240
<v Speaker 7>what's next?</v>

2094
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.440
<v Speaker 7>A new period of time.</v>

2095
01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:30.441
<v Speaker 7>A new cycle of time begins afterwards and so that is exactly what will happen</v>

2096
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 7>because the Maya,</v>

2097
01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:37.490
<v Speaker 7>they essentially had knowledge of a process called precession.</v>

2098
01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:42.620
<v Speaker 7>Precession basically means that the earth is at a certain angle on it's,</v>

2099
01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:44.730
<v Speaker 7>but this access that it's on,</v>

2100
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.840
<v Speaker 7>it wobbles.</v>

2101
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.930
<v Speaker 7>It makes this big wedding while it's spinning folks,</v>

2102
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:53.460
<v Speaker 7>there's a 26,000 year cycle where it wobbles just sort of like a top,</v>

2103
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:53.941
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2104
01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:54.631
<v Speaker 7>or anything else.</v>

2105
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:54.961
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't,</v>

2106
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 7>it's not absolutely perfectly in the way.</v>

2107
01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:57.480
<v Speaker 7>It's exactly,</v>

2108
01:03:57.481 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 7>and because the 2012 phenomena is fantastic,</v>

2109
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:06.081
<v Speaker 7>are interesting is because that waddled this rotation returns for the first time</v>

2110
01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 7>in 25,600 years to its point of origin.</v>

2111
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.940
<v Speaker 7>Now once that happens,</v>

2112
01:04:11.941 --> 01:04:12.721
<v Speaker 7>which will be,</v>

2113
01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:13.021
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2114
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:13.854
<v Speaker 7>soon,</v>

2115
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2116
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 7>what's going to happen is this wobble.</v>

2117
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:17.610
<v Speaker 7>This has procession cycle going to stop.</v>

2118
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:18.001
<v Speaker 7>Of course,</v>

2119
01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:18.870
<v Speaker 7>not you.</v>

2120
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.630
<v Speaker 7>It'll continue just like at the end of each,</v>

2121
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 7>each year on the 31st of December,</v>

2122
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 7>the following day,</v>

2123
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 7>it's January 1st.</v>

2124
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.690
<v Speaker 7>That is the same thing with the Mayan calendar.</v>

2125
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 7>The world will not end.</v>

2126
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.060
<v Speaker 7>There's no fucking judgment day.</v>

2127
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.410
<v Speaker 7>There's no fucking apocalypse there.</v>

2128
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.293
<v Speaker 7>No fucking,</v>

2129
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:36.541
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2130
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:38.400
<v Speaker 7>Jesus coming down in a fucking cloud.</v>

2131
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:39.490
<v Speaker 7>But what I think is in is,</v>

2132
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 7>and what have you are so wrong.</v>

2133
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:44.460
<v Speaker 7>What if on December 21st you wake up the fucking skies on fire,</v>

2134
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:45.810
<v Speaker 7>Jesus is on a surfboard.</v>

2135
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.580
<v Speaker 7>Rollerblading.</v>

2136
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:47.851
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2137
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:48.151
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2138
01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:49.110
<v Speaker 7>What if you're wrong?</v>

2139
01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 7>How can you be so confident that it's not going to end?</v>

2140
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 7>The world could end for you,</v>

2141
01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:53.311
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2142
01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:54.091
<v Speaker 7>When you walk out this door,</v>

2143
01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:55.980
<v Speaker 7>you get hit by an asteroid cramp,</v>

2144
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:56.641
<v Speaker 7>a crack,</v>

2145
01:04:56.641 --> 01:04:59.400
<v Speaker 7>open a beer and toasted Jesus on the surfboard man.</v>

2146
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 7>Cause imagine to offices came back and he was the silver surfer</v>

2147
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.160
<v Speaker 7>fucking naked fly around telling people to love each other.</v>

2148
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:09.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 7>I think people recognize that this,</v>

2150
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 7>the way we're doing it right now is not going to be sustainable the way that</v>

2151
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.000
<v Speaker 7>we're the ocean,</v>

2152
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 7>the way they were killing all the fish.</v>

2153
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 7>And I think people naturally look to someone to intervene.</v>

2154
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 7>Just like when you were a kid and you lit something on fire,</v>

2155
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 7>you like call dad because you want someone to come in and intervene.</v>

2156
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.170
<v Speaker 7>And I think for a lot of people,</v>

2157
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 7>especially people that fancy themselves to be intelligent,</v>

2158
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 7>two intelligent for religion would like to believe in something.</v>

2159
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:40.510
<v Speaker 7>So they go with aliens and they think that the aliens are going to come down and</v>

2160
01:05:40.511 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 7>somehow know that they're going to intervene.</v>

2161
01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:42.031
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2162
01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:42.521
<v Speaker 7>and so,</v>

2163
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:42.761
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>

2164
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 7>and I'm very set against that.</v>

2165
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 7>I think it's an actual disservice to this whole field.</v>

2166
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.653
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2167
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 7>people who are propagating ideas like this.</v>

2168
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 7>I mean last or two years ago I was asked,</v>

2169
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2170
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:54.941
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

2171
01:05:54.941 --> 01:05:57.960
<v Speaker 7>how come the aliens are not stopping the oil leak in,</v>

2172
01:05:57.961 --> 01:05:58.170
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

2173
01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 7>in the Gulf of Mexico?</v>

2174
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:00.791
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2175
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:01.390
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2176
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:02.223
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2177
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 7>how do you answer that?</v>

2178
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:03.461
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2179
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:03.611
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2180
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:05.740
<v Speaker 7>because it was us who created,</v>

2181
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:06.580
<v Speaker 7>you say,</v>

2182
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:06.821
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2183
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 7>I was talking to them and say exactly that,</v>

2184
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.470
<v Speaker 7>that crabs and shrimp and things are just a bunch of country animals and then</v>

2185
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:14.831
<v Speaker 7>not really,</v>

2186
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:17.010
<v Speaker 7>they don't care if they get fucked up by oil.</v>

2187
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2188
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2189
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.450
<v Speaker 7>the thing to me,</v>

2190
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.150
<v Speaker 7>we can keep having cars.</v>

2191
01:06:22.151 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 7>The aliens are fine with it right now.</v>

2192
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:26.830
<v Speaker 7>It's just so extremely bizarre to,</v>

2193
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.161
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2194
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 7>bank on the idea that to terrestrial was save us because,</v>

2195
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:31.541
<v Speaker 7>or even Jesus.</v>

2196
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 7>Because the thing is that we all know inherently what's good and what's bad.</v>

2197
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:36.970
<v Speaker 7>We all have a choice to make.</v>

2198
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.340
<v Speaker 7>You either do the right thing or you did a wrong thing.</v>

2199
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 7>Whatever your,</v>

2200
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 7>your motives are,</v>

2201
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:42.641
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

2202
01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:43.120
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>

2203
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.830
<v Speaker 7>to bank upon others,</v>

2204
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 7>to salvage the situation is nonsense.</v>

2205
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.660
<v Speaker 7>It's a child is selling.</v>

2206
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.650
<v Speaker 7>It's a childhood thing.</v>

2207
01:06:50.651 --> 01:06:51.190
<v Speaker 7>It's a thing.</v>

2208
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.550
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2209
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:51.941
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

2210
01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.950
<v Speaker 7>looking to someone older and smarter,</v>

2211
01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:54.281
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>

2212
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.120
<v Speaker 7>Care of your mess.</v>

2213
01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:55.691
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

2214
01:06:55.691 --> 01:06:56.050
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2215
01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:56.620
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2216
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.320
<v Speaker 7>but it's,</v>

2217
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 7>it's kind of a weird thing that we want,</v>

2218
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:01.980
<v Speaker 7>we want to be rescued by a daddy.</v>

2219
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 7>Daddy's a god or daddy's an alien.</v>

2220
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:05.980
<v Speaker 7>Daddy ain't coming.</v>

2221
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.360
<v Speaker 7>But my question is what,</v>

2222
01:07:08.361 --> 01:07:08.470
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2223
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:13.470
<v Speaker 7>what do you think about these different stories about UFOs hovering around</v>

2224
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:19.320
<v Speaker 7>nuclear test facilities and that shutting a powered down at certain places,</v>

2225
01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 7>stopping missile tests and things along those lines.</v>

2226
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.070
<v Speaker 7>Do you believe in those stories?</v>

2227
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:25.180
<v Speaker 7>Like I said earlier,</v>

2228
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:25.481
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2229
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:29.290
<v Speaker 7>I don't follow the modern Ufo field very closely,</v>

2230
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.461
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

2231
01:07:30.461 --> 01:07:33.520
<v Speaker 7>the nuggets that are important,</v>

2232
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.610
<v Speaker 7>this is definitely one of them where you know,</v>

2233
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:37.260
<v Speaker 7>there are,</v>

2234
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:37.540
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2235
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 7>certain catastrophes that have happened lately and you would actually see that</v>

2236
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 7>right beforehand there would be some type of UFO activity.</v>

2237
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 7>Now of course,</v>

2238
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:46.541
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2239
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:51.541
<v Speaker 7>with today's Photoshop technology you have to be very cautious in this day and</v>

2240
01:07:52.031 --> 01:07:52.510
<v Speaker 7>age.</v>

2241
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.841
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2242
01:07:52.841 --> 01:07:56.770
<v Speaker 7>what you can subscribe to and what you think might be an actual hoax.</v>

2243
01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>

2244
01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.541
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2245
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 7>not everything is positive with our,</v>

2246
01:08:00.311 --> 01:08:00.521
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2247
01:08:00.521 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 7>computer developments.</v>

2248
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.380
<v Speaker 7>And things like this.</v>

2249
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.490
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2250
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:08.490
<v Speaker 7>but the fact that you have full activity has turned off nuclear power plants is</v>

2251
01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:12.040
<v Speaker 7>not a an idea or an uh,</v>

2252
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:13.623
<v Speaker 7>a rumor.</v>

2253
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 7>There have been military documents from</v>

2254
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:21.070
<v Speaker 6>the 60s that have been recently released that have recorded exactly such a</v>

2255
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:24.860
<v Speaker 6>events and that's quite fascinating.</v>

2256
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:25.521
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2257
01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:26.400
<v Speaker 6>it's quite fascinating.</v>

2258
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:28.850
<v Speaker 6>They would come and let check these fucking monkeys out.</v>

2259
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if we went to the Congo and we found some champs and they had figured</v>

2260
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 6>out how to make guns.</v>

2261
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:33.741
<v Speaker 6>We were like,</v>

2262
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

2263
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.890
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

2264
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:37.724
<v Speaker 6>These chimps are,</v>

2265
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:38.751
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>

2266
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:38.931
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2267
01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:39.111
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2268
01:08:39.111 --> 01:08:39.321
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2269
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:39.561
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2270
01:08:39.561 --> 01:08:40.251
<v Speaker 6>Nah Bitch,</v>

2271
01:08:40.251 --> 01:08:40.940
<v Speaker 6>Naw Bitch.</v>

2272
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.210
<v Speaker 6>We would tranquilizer and we would take their guns and we would take the really</v>

2273
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:47.000
<v Speaker 6>smart ones that figured out that make guns and we probably put them in a zoo</v>

2274
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:47.450
<v Speaker 6>somewhere.</v>

2275
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:48.051
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

2276
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:48.271
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

2277
01:08:48.271 --> 01:08:48.590
<v Speaker 6>we would,</v>

2278
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 6>we would definitely not let that happen.</v>

2279
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:55.210
<v Speaker 6>And the idea is that maybe it's really fucking super hard to get to earth and</v>

2280
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 6>maybe they only come like really rare.</v>

2281
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.820
<v Speaker 6>It just seems a long gap for us a few thousand years.</v>

2282
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.930
<v Speaker 6>But for them it ain't shit.</v>

2283
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:03.561
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2284
01:09:03.561 --> 01:09:05.060
<v Speaker 6>it's possible that if you've will know,</v>

2285
01:09:05.061 --> 01:09:05.871
<v Speaker 6>because if you,</v>

2286
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:06.170
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2287
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.003
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2288
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.370
<v Speaker 6>if you fly as if,</v>

2289
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:12.230
<v Speaker 6>if they have that type of propulsion technology,</v>

2290
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:13.490
<v Speaker 6>if you fly,</v>

2291
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:14.324
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

2292
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Speaker 6>at a very close to the speed of light at 99% or 9.9% of the speed of light,</v>

2293
01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:26.450
<v Speaker 6>then if five years elapse on your spaceship,</v>

2294
01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.630
<v Speaker 6>5,000 years elapse on earth,</v>

2295
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:30.830
<v Speaker 6>this phenomenon,</v>

2296
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 6>anyone can go online and check it out.</v>

2297
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:36.080
<v Speaker 6>It's called a time dilation phenomenon.</v>

2298
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.240
<v Speaker 6>And this is automatic.</v>

2299
01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:37.641
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2300
01:09:37.641 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 6>And it's a mathematical fact.</v>

2301
01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:44.380
<v Speaker 6>So just imagine because we have ancient stories of these gods that lived in,</v>

2302
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 6>Ain't before the Egyptian Pharaohs began with their dynasties.</v>

2303
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:54.070
<v Speaker 6>This is all pre dynastic stuff where we have certain kings ruling 56,000 years</v>

2304
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 6>and it's actually the,</v>

2305
01:09:58.821 --> 01:09:59.180
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2306
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.640
<v Speaker 6>the Wy which just keeps coming back pitch.</v>

2307
01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:02.331
<v Speaker 6>What did I tell you?</v>

2308
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.110
<v Speaker 6>Fix that shit.</v>

2309
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:04.340
<v Speaker 6>Actually set them a monument.</v>

2310
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 6>I'll see in a couple of thousand years.</v>

2311
01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:06.320
<v Speaker 6>Sam,</v>

2312
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 6>imagine you know that this,</v>

2313
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.720
<v Speaker 6>this colon called King or space traveler is on a spaceship for 15 years.</v>

2314
01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:14.181
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2315
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:16.430
<v Speaker 6>saunters around the universe and does something else.</v>

2316
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 6>And then after 54,000 years have elapsed on earth,</v>

2317
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:25.090
<v Speaker 6>well he basically ruled for 54,000 years because he never abdicated before he</v>

2318
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:26.270
<v Speaker 6>left.</v>

2319
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:27.800
<v Speaker 6>So that is just,</v>

2320
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2321
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:32.990
<v Speaker 6>it blows your fucking mind when you look at these ancient texts and you're like,</v>

2322
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.370
<v Speaker 6>what would a really,</v>

2323
01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:35.813
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

2324
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

2325
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.460
<v Speaker 6>that is crazy.</v>

2326
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible that someone could eventually figure out how to let something go</v>

2327
01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 6>the speed of light without killing everybody inside of it?</v>

2328
01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:46.040
<v Speaker 6>And when they hit a bird,</v>

2329
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:46.993
<v Speaker 6>they thought this,</v>

2330
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.920
<v Speaker 6>when are you going to speed of light and you hit a bird?</v>

2331
01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2332
01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.213
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to be,</v>

2333
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:51.450
<v Speaker 6>there'll be pulverized,</v>

2334
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:52.910
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to be able to dodge birds.</v>

2335
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 6>But you question about,</v>

2336
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:55.250
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2337
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.590
<v Speaker 6>how could you go at this speed without being crushed?</v>

2338
01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:00.830
<v Speaker 6>The asked the same question when they created cars.</v>

2339
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.171
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2340
01:11:01.171 --> 01:11:03.390
<v Speaker 6>how about when the created trains they thought weren't training.</v>

2341
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.690
<v Speaker 6>If you go 30 miles an hour would kill you.</v>

2342
01:11:05.691 --> 01:11:06.524
<v Speaker 6>That's what they really thought.</v>

2343
01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.940
<v Speaker 6>Much five and a plane,</v>

2344
01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:08.774
<v Speaker 6>you're fine.</v>

2345
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.270
<v Speaker 6>Any is newer environment and uh,</v>

2346
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2347
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 6>could you imagine getting a dude from like</v>

2348
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 2>the 18 hundreds of thought?</v>

2349
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 2>You're going to die in a train and putting them in a corvette.</v>

2350
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:18.370
<v Speaker 2>She started ready,</v>

2351
01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2352
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.800
<v Speaker 2>just looking at the miles an hour.</v>

2353
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.090
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2354
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:24.660
<v Speaker 2>if you brought a corvette,</v>

2355
01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>if you could bring a corvette like a thousand years ago,</v>

2356
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:28.260
<v Speaker 2>people would,</v>

2357
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.070
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

2358
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.903
<v Speaker 2>God</v>

2359
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:32.103
<v Speaker 2>under God,</v>

2360
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 2>ups undergo which,</v>

2361
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.823
<v Speaker 2>and they will kill you.</v>

2362
01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>All the chicks would it blow you?</v>

2363
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 2>They would all blow you because no one else has a corvette.</v>

2364
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:39.953
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2365
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 2>not only do you have a bad ass car either the only dude on the planet with a</v>

2366
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

2367
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2368
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:45.291
<v Speaker 2>chicks would SPI.</v>

2369
01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:48.010
<v Speaker 2>So on your jock don't know.</v>

2370
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2371
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.870
<v Speaker 2>and it's totally fascinating because that is exactly,</v>

2372
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:52.531
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>

2373
01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:53.400
<v Speaker 2>That is the idea.</v>

2374
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:54.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the cargo cult died.</v>

2375
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:54.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2376
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking today I was,</v>

2377
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I was driving in as I often do when I'm in traffic in La,</v>

2378
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 2>that the only way you can really keep people in line is if you don't let them</v>

2379
01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:04.614
<v Speaker 2>fly around.</v>

2380
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as you can imagine,</v>

2381
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:09.720
<v Speaker 2>if we would have flying cars by now,</v>

2382
01:12:09.721 --> 01:12:10.140
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2383
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.040
<v Speaker 2>there'll be no borders,</v>

2384
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>borders and be done,</v>

2385
01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.230
<v Speaker 2>it will be death.</v>

2386
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.490
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have nets.</v>

2387
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:14.791
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2388
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:19.750
<v Speaker 2>no set up to keep people from flying over from Mexico like mile high net.</v>

2389
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:22.860
<v Speaker 2>The population would be decreased by $100 million.</v>

2390
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.630
<v Speaker 2>100 million people instantaneously really spread out.</v>

2391
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Where would they go?</v>

2392
01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Or they would just crash and die because they wouldn't know how to handle</v>

2393
01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:31.070
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2394
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:34.480
<v Speaker 2>If they were magnetized where they were like two magnets can't come off each</v>

2395
01:12:34.481 --> 01:12:35.250
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

2396
01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:38.910
<v Speaker 2>then you put it on a flying cars and they're the maglev trains.</v>

2397
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:39.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2398
01:12:39.181 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 2>they're flying cars with magnets in the front of them so they could never</v>

2399
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:42.150
<v Speaker 2>actually touch.</v>

2400
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:42.983
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2401
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm always thinking,</v>

2402
01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:46.470
<v Speaker 2>learned to fix the society.</v>

2403
01:12:46.471 --> 01:12:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be a part of Shit.</v>

2404
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.601
<v Speaker 2>Good thing.</v>

2405
01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 2>The problem.</v>

2406
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2407
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:51.150
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me if you,</v>

2408
01:12:51.151 --> 01:12:51.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2409
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:53.850
<v Speaker 2>listen to the current theory,</v>

2410
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:55.100
<v Speaker 2>like if you listen to,</v>

2411
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:55.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2412
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:56.210
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>

2413
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.200
<v Speaker 2>what does that one gentleman's name who's,</v>

2414
01:12:58.201 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2415
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:59.670
<v Speaker 2>they always use him.</v>

2416
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:00.061
<v Speaker 2>Stanton.</v>

2417
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:00.510
<v Speaker 2>Freeman.</v>

2418
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2419
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:02.100
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

2421
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:03.070
<v Speaker 2>he's a clear physicist.</v>

2422
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:03.891
<v Speaker 2>Physicist.</v>

2423
01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a big proponent of,</v>

2424
01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2425
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>the possibility,</v>

2426
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:07.900
<v Speaker 2>the reality of Ufos.</v>

2427
01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2428
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:09.361
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2429
01:13:09.361 --> 01:13:09.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2430
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:14.010
<v Speaker 2>he talks about magnetic propulsion systems at some sort of a magnetic wave could</v>

2431
01:13:14.011 --> 01:13:14.620
<v Speaker 2>be created,</v>

2432
01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.980
<v Speaker 2>magnetic propulsion systems could be like,</v>

2433
01:13:16.981 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 2>what is the outside area when you see like,</v>

2434
01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:20.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2435
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:22.740
<v Speaker 2>like the glow of the saucer,</v>

2436
01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:23.650
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on,</v>

2437
01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 2>some sort of magnetic sort of a thing.</v>

2438
01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.521
<v Speaker 2>If that was a case,</v>

2439
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 2>that would be a way that you could keep from crashing into each other.</v>

2440
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Like magnets can't touch magnets,</v>

2441
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:31.450
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2442
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Ms Obviously it's different type of magnetics,</v>

2443
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.100
<v Speaker 2>but I would see if seems like,</v>

2444
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:35.760
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

2445
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2446
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 2>if you can use,</v>

2447
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2448
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.170
<v Speaker 2>something and create some sort of a magnetic field,</v>

2449
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you could possibly also use it to repel other spaceships.</v>

2450
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:43.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2451
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2452
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>We would stop all car accidents,</v>

2453
01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but I would,</v>

2454
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I would s I would prefer if before having flying cars,</v>

2455
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:55.130
<v Speaker 2>we now have to realize that we would be half a technology to build cars or in</v>

2456
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.350
<v Speaker 2>car engines that run on water.</v>

2457
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 2>So before we do flying,</v>

2458
01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:00.900
<v Speaker 2>flying cars,</v>

2459
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.700
<v Speaker 2>let's run our cars on water,</v>

2460
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:04.470
<v Speaker 2>which as long as they still sound good,</v>

2461
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2462
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.660
<v Speaker 2>they can put them.</v>

2463
01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I like the cartilage.</v>

2464
01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:08.041
<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.</v>

2465
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2466
01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:09.900
<v Speaker 2>your car's got a little bass to it,</v>

2467
01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Paul.</v>

2468
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2469
01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2470
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:12.303
<v Speaker 2>it feels good.</v>

2471
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.390
<v Speaker 4>It makes me feel American.</v>

2472
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Want to listen to some fine.</v>

2473
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 4>There will be some company they will come up with it.</v>

2474
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.263
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2475
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:19.571
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2476
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:19.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2477
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:22.420
<v Speaker 4>BMW is cheating right now and they're m fives.</v>

2478
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:23.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm really disappointed.</v>

2479
01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.100
<v Speaker 4>BMW,</v>

2480
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 4>how dare you do this.</v>

2481
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:29.530
<v Speaker 4>They switched over from naturally aspirated engines to turbocharged engines.</v>

2482
01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:30.311
<v Speaker 4>And when you do that,</v>

2483
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:33.770
<v Speaker 4>you send forced air into the engine and,</v>

2484
01:14:33.771 --> 01:14:33.981
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

2485
01:14:33.981 --> 01:14:35.590
<v Speaker 4>it muffles the sound.</v>

2486
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.800
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't give you that deep like v eight Shelby Mustang feeling blah.</v>

2487
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.270
<v Speaker 4>They lose all that sound.</v>

2488
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 4>And so the latest m m m five the old one,</v>

2489
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:48.311
<v Speaker 4>the last model,</v>

2490
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:49.450
<v Speaker 4>which was an amazing car,</v>

2491
01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:52.690
<v Speaker 4>500 plus horsepower was a v 10.</v>

2492
01:14:52.691 --> 01:14:53.980
<v Speaker 4>It was a large nationally,</v>

2493
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.540
<v Speaker 4>naturally aspirated engine,</v>

2494
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.560
<v Speaker 4>but now they've switched over to turbochargers.</v>

2495
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:02.580
<v Speaker 4>So because people love the sound like the old BMW m five was fucking glorious.</v>

2496
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 4>The sound that thing would hit when it hits red line.</v>

2497
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2498
01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:06.641
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

2499
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 4>I may freak when it comes to engineering and technology.</v>

2500
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:15.390
<v Speaker 4>I am absolutely fascinated by the automobile industry because although everybody</v>

2501
01:15:15.491 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 4>like likes to think of them as like,</v>

2502
01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 4>it's like Frivolous,</v>

2503
01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:18.641
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2504
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 4>you have a nice car,</v>

2505
01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:20.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2506
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:20.831
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2507
01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:21.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2508
01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking materialistic.</v>

2509
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2510
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:27.340
<v Speaker 4>I am celebrating cool shit that human beings have created.</v>

2511
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.460
<v Speaker 4>And one of the coolest things that's going on in the world when it comes to</v>

2512
01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 4>innovation is the automobile industry.</v>

2513
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.200
<v Speaker 4>When you look at like high end automobiles,</v>

2514
01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:35.521
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

2515
01:15:35.521 --> 01:15:38.660
<v Speaker 4>the craftsmanship and intelligence that it's involved,</v>

2516
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 4>even if I couldn't afford a nice car,</v>

2517
01:15:40.511 --> 01:15:42.040
<v Speaker 4>I would still be fascinated.</v>

2518
01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:45.850
<v Speaker 4>I would always read those magazines just same way I read Gizmodo or uh,</v>

2519
01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:46.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2520
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:46.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2521
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.940
<v Speaker 4>we'll buy a copy of wired or end gadget.</v>

2522
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by the innovation.</v>

2523
01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated by the continual,</v>

2524
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2525
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 4>the need of d to improve things.</v>

2526
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 4>And when you see it in cars,</v>

2527
01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 4>it's incredible what they're doing now.</v>

2528
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:04.410
<v Speaker 4>But BMW unfortunately had to resort to cheating to make their car sound good.</v>

2529
01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.640
<v Speaker 4>So now it comes through the stereo.</v>

2530
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:11.440
<v Speaker 4>There's a v eight sound that comes through the steroids that sync up with the</v>

2531
01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:12.730
<v Speaker 4>computer and the engine.</v>

2532
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:14.160
<v Speaker 4>So as you're revving your car,</v>

2533
01:16:14.161 --> 01:16:14.994
<v Speaker 4>it's gone.</v>

2534
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.260
<v Speaker 4>That's not real.</v>

2535
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:19.510
<v Speaker 4>It's coming through your fucking stereo speakers</v>

2536
01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.780
<v Speaker 4>that told me that's a joke.</v>

2537
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:24.040
<v Speaker 4>Please BMW.</v>

2538
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.060
<v Speaker 4>How dare you?</v>

2539
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.070
<v Speaker 4>How dare you?</v>

2540
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:28.533
<v Speaker 4>How dare you?</v>

2541
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.841
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2542
01:16:28.841 --> 01:16:30.940
<v Speaker 4>you know Nissan doesn't do that with the GTR.</v>

2543
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.130
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2544
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2545
01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:36.220
<v Speaker 4>I the GTR is one of the fastest cars in the world and it sounds like a fucking</v>

2546
01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:36.820
<v Speaker 4>spaceship.</v>

2547
01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a different sound that turbocharger Ooh,</v>

2548
01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:40.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a different sound,</v>

2549
01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:42.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's still fucking bad ass.</v>

2550
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.940
<v Speaker 4>You got to accept the fact that this doesn't sound like a Va.</v>

2551
01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:47.470
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a force induction car,</v>

2552
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:48.520
<v Speaker 4>which may not have.</v>

2553
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not as sweet and as like manly a note,</v>

2554
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:53.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's still pretty fucking trippy.</v>

2555
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.790
<v Speaker 4>You've got to accept what your car sounds like.</v>

2556
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:55.624
<v Speaker 4>BMW.</v>

2557
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.231
<v Speaker 4>I was actually,</v>

2558
01:16:56.231 --> 01:16:57.760
<v Speaker 4>when you're saying this story,</v>

2559
01:16:57.761 --> 01:16:58.120
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2560
01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:58.361
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2561
01:16:58.361 --> 01:16:59.020
<v Speaker 4>the day there,</v>

2562
01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.220
<v Speaker 4>it's just not as loud anywhere.</v>

2563
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:00.490
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2564
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:01.181
<v Speaker 4>they shouldn't have it.</v>

2565
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:01.961
<v Speaker 4>Go through this stereo.</v>

2566
01:17:01.961 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 4>So you think it is.</v>

2567
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.960
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking that's what I fill up first.</v>

2568
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:06.550
<v Speaker 4>That's what I,</v>

2569
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:07.630
<v Speaker 4>how I understood it too.</v>

2570
01:17:07.631 --> 01:17:08.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2571
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 4>And then it was like they're cheating.</v>

2572
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.660
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2573
01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:11.550
<v Speaker 4>that's worse.</v>

2574
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.451
<v Speaker 4>Make noise,</v>

2575
01:17:12.451 --> 01:17:12.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2576
01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:13.570
<v Speaker 4>worse than idea.</v>

2577
01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:14.404
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 4>We thought,</v>

2579
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:16.540
<v Speaker 4>well the Porsche,</v>

2580
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:17.480
<v Speaker 4>the new Porsche,</v>

2581
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2582
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:20.060
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they've done with the nine nine one,</v>

2583
01:17:20.061 --> 01:17:20.391
<v Speaker 4>the palm,</v>

2584
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of Porsche's and I know it sounds like such a douche bag thing to</v>

2585
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

2586
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:24.531
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2587
01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:24.651
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2588
01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 4>you like Porsche.</v>

2589
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 4>You know what else you do?</v>

2590
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:27.021
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2591
01:17:27.021 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 4>do you like playing Polo?</v>

2592
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 4>You fucking queer.</v>

2593
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2594
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like something like the privileged people,</v>

2595
01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:32.691
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

2596
01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm a freak for engineering.</v>

2597
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:39.251
<v Speaker 4>I'm absolutely fascinated by technological innovation and cars have come so far</v>

2598
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:41.060
<v Speaker 4>in my lifetime,</v>

2599
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>

2600
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.530
<v Speaker 4>my first car was a 1973 Chevy Chevelle.</v>

2601
01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.080
<v Speaker 4>It was a piece of shit was a Chevelle ss.</v>

2602
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 4>I had it for one day and it wouldn't fucking start.</v>

2603
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 4>And I called the dude up and go,</v>

2604
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:52.061
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2605
01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:53.570
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking car doesn't even start like,</v>

2606
01:17:53.571 --> 01:17:54.710
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with this fucking car?</v>

2607
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:55.350
<v Speaker 4>And the guy goes,</v>

2608
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:56.121
<v Speaker 4>you can give back to me.</v>

2609
01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:57.020
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you your money back.</v>

2610
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2611
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 4>oh you knew it was a piece of shit.</v>

2612
01:17:58.671 --> 01:17:59.504
<v Speaker 4>You son of a bitch.</v>

2613
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.270
<v Speaker 4>So I brought it back to him and he gave my money back.</v>

2614
01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.900
<v Speaker 4>But when you look at that and then you look at like a Porsche nine 11 like they</v>

2615
01:18:05.901 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 4>just released the newest one,</v>

2616
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 4>the nine nine one it's a technological masterpiece.</v>

2617
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.650
<v Speaker 4>They have dual clutches now.</v>

2618
01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:15.260
<v Speaker 4>You know I prefer a manual gearbox.</v>

2619
01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:16.570
<v Speaker 4>I like shifting my own fears.</v>

2620
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.100
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2621
01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Mine has dual clutch is hearing your Volkswagen does as you're driving annual,</v>

2622
01:18:21.801 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>

2623
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.320
<v Speaker 4>You shared with the paddles.</v>

2624
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.740
<v Speaker 4>These paddles shift in like milliseconds.</v>

2625
01:18:27.741 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 4>It used to be that automatic sucked and the reason why you know you got a a four</v>

2626
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 4>speed is cause it was actually faster.</v>

2627
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.640
<v Speaker 4>Five-Speed was fast,</v>

2628
01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 4>six speed was faster.</v>

2629
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.400
<v Speaker 4>But then somewhere along the line that's the automatics in like they caught up</v>

2630
01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 4>to the the manual cars and then they surpassed him like greatly.</v>

2631
01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Now if like a manual Porsche is like 4.6 seconds,</v>

2632
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:53.350
<v Speaker 4>zero to 60 but the automatic you can get that bitch down to like 3.9 3.6 because</v>

2633
01:18:54.201 --> 01:18:55.270
<v Speaker 4>they have this um,</v>

2634
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:58.340
<v Speaker 4>this dual clutch that where you can have a launch control,</v>

2635
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.430
<v Speaker 4>like you stop on the gas and it does it all with the computer.</v>

2636
01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:05.360
<v Speaker 4>You stop on the gas and just let off the brake and it just calculates the amount</v>

2637
01:19:05.361 --> 01:19:07.250
<v Speaker 4>of wheel spin controls.</v>

2638
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:11.330
<v Speaker 4>It gives you the perfect amount of acceleration and it just goes like a fucking</v>

2639
01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:12.164
<v Speaker 4>Bat Outta hell.</v>

2640
01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.170
<v Speaker 4>They have a launch control and a Nissan Gtr,</v>

2641
01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:18.260
<v Speaker 4>which was like one of the most technologically advanced cars that humans have</v>

2642
01:19:18.261 --> 01:19:18.711
<v Speaker 4>ever created.</v>

2643
01:19:18.711 --> 01:19:21.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a car that they're actually losing money on selling.</v>

2644
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:25.550
<v Speaker 4>It's such an incredible masterpiece of technology and they want in it to Nissan.</v>

2645
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:28.580
<v Speaker 4>So they sell it for like a hundred grand and they lose money on each one,</v>

2646
01:19:28.581 --> 01:19:30.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's their flagship when it hit.</v>

2647
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.760
<v Speaker 4>When you do launch control and the Nissan,</v>

2648
01:19:31.761 --> 01:19:34.370
<v Speaker 4>it brings you to 2.8 seconds,</v>

2649
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:37.580
<v Speaker 4>zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds.</v>

2650
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.693
<v Speaker 4>Wild.</v>

2651
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 4>Does it depend what surface you're on though?</v>

2652
01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.000
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2653
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2654
01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:41.781
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2655
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:44.720
<v Speaker 4>Of course you would like to be on a race track ideally where it's nice and</v>

2656
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:45.650
<v Speaker 4>smooth and flat,</v>

2657
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.760
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2658
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:47.201
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2659
01:19:47.201 --> 01:19:52.201
<v Speaker 4>it's an incredible masterpiece of engineering and what they've done with Porsche</v>

2660
01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:53.084
<v Speaker 4>at the combat,</v>

2661
01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 4>the sound issue is they,</v>

2662
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:55.101
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2663
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 4>they just made a better fucking exhaust system.</v>

2664
01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.760
<v Speaker 4>That's how Germans rocket for the most part.</v>

2665
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.310
<v Speaker 4>They didn't cheat like those other BMW assholes.</v>

2666
01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.280
<v Speaker 4>I just think it was it just a bad idea that someone,</v>

2667
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:06.180
<v Speaker 4>someone talked them into doing their property.</v>

2668
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 4>That's horrible if true.</v>

2669
01:20:07.501 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2670
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 4>I believe</v>

2671
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.221
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2672
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.120
<v Speaker 7>but that's just,</v>

2673
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 7>it just does not seem real.</v>

2674
01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:10.771
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2675
01:20:10.771 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

2676
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2677
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 7>BMW in Germany,</v>

2678
01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:14.950
<v Speaker 7>that's Sturman do you read it all in or all local first year?</v>

2679
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.290
<v Speaker 7>It's real.</v>

2680
01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:17.123
<v Speaker 7>It's real.</v>

2681
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:17.791
<v Speaker 7>The Porsche,</v>

2682
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:18.601
<v Speaker 7>that solution is,</v>

2683
01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:19.160
<v Speaker 7>they have it.</v>

2684
01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.750
<v Speaker 7>I'm baffled that were the sound.</v>

2685
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.971
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2686
01:20:21.971 --> 01:20:22.471
<v Speaker 7>there's like a,</v>

2687
01:20:22.471 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 7>a valve that they can open up or the sound like enters into the cabin more,</v>

2688
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.950
<v Speaker 7>but it's a rich sounding exhaust note anyway,</v>

2689
01:20:28.951 --> 01:20:30.240
<v Speaker 7>they figured out how to do it the right way,</v>

2690
01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:31.980
<v Speaker 7>but that's a naturally aspirated car.</v>

2691
01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:32.700
<v Speaker 7>The new Porsche.</v>

2692
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.810
<v Speaker 7>When you get into turbos,</v>

2693
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:35.850
<v Speaker 7>you just got to deal with the fact that it's a different sound.</v>

2694
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.890
<v Speaker 7>That's one of the coolest things about the,</v>

2695
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2696
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.880
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2697
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2698
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:41.460
<v Speaker 7>the a Ufo is that people see that they,</v>

2699
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:42.840
<v Speaker 7>they say they're fucking silent.</v>

2700
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 7>Like those ones that flew over Phoenix,</v>

2701
01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:46.171
<v Speaker 7>they say that,</v>

2702
01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:46.411
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2703
01:20:46.411 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 7>this is gigantic triangle that's a flying through the air and it's completely</v>

2704
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 7>silent and you see like little glowing lights around the edges of it and shit.</v>

2705
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.291
<v Speaker 7>Your pants,</v>

2706
01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:56.940
<v Speaker 7>cause it's as big as a football field.</v>

2707
01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:57.750
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2708
01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:00.180
<v Speaker 7>Do you believe that the Phoenix lights story and all that shit?</v>

2709
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:01.011
<v Speaker 7>It is a,</v>

2710
01:21:01.011 --> 01:21:01.844
<v Speaker 7>it's a different,</v>

2711
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 7>it's definitely an interesting story and I've seen the footage.</v>

2712
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2713
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.320
<v Speaker 7>it's quite bizarre.</v>

2714
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:08.490
<v Speaker 7>And the flares though,</v>

2715
01:21:08.491 --> 01:21:09.000
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2716
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.620
<v Speaker 7>Couldn't it be fun?</v>

2717
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.081
<v Speaker 7>Oh no,</v>

2718
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 7>because they didn't come down kind of hovered the way that the players would</v>

2719
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 7>come down and you know,</v>

2720
01:21:15.601 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 7>the whole Ufo field to me is why not.</v>

2721
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:19.981
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2722
01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 7>It could be because you know,</v>

2723
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.900
<v Speaker 7>I know personally that a lot of UFO stories or abduction stories or stories by</v>

2724
01:21:27.271 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 7>experiencers,</v>

2725
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:29.260
<v Speaker 7>they're all made up.</v>

2726
01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.600
<v Speaker 7>A lot of them are made up.</v>

2727
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 7>I know some people that,</v>

2728
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.760
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2729
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 7>have told me that they made stuff up and so first of all,</v>

2730
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:38.520
<v Speaker 7>it's a huge disservice to the entire field.</v>

2731
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.860
<v Speaker 7>And it's funny that you keep calling it a field.</v>

2732
01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:42.000
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2733
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 7>it is a field of study,</v>

2734
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 7>I guess it is or topic when it comes,</v>

2735
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 7>when actually when the shit hits the fan and then Ufo or fucking for sure.</v>

2736
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 7>Really here then it's a field.</v>

2737
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:52.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2738
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.011
<v Speaker 7>100% yeah.</v>

2739
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:53.890
<v Speaker 7>But then still a field,</v>

2740
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:55.090
<v Speaker 7>all the bunkers,</v>

2741
01:21:55.091 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 7>hilly field and then all the debunkers we'll say,</v>

2742
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:57.360
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2743
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.590
<v Speaker 7>we knew it all along,</v>

2744
01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.180
<v Speaker 7>but we just couldn't say something.</v>

2745
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.380
<v Speaker 7>You think so you watch?</v>

2746
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.273
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

2747
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2748
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:03.721
<v Speaker 7>That's interesting.</v>

2749
01:22:03.721 --> 01:22:04.554
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

2750
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 7>People like Erich von Daniken,</v>

2751
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:06.581
<v Speaker 7>Zacharias,</v>

2752
01:22:06.581 --> 01:22:08.340
<v Speaker 7>Zechariah stitching will be left by the wayside.</v>

2753
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.480
<v Speaker 7>So he's all this tumor ologists all the Egyptologists,</v>

2754
01:22:12.481 --> 01:22:12.691
<v Speaker 7>they're all,</v>

2755
01:22:12.691 --> 01:22:12.801
<v Speaker 7>Yo,</v>

2756
01:22:12.801 --> 01:22:12.971
<v Speaker 7>Yo,</v>

2757
01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 7>whoa.</v>

2758
01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:14.610
<v Speaker 7>We just couldn't talk about it.</v>

2759
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.211
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2760
01:22:15.211 --> 01:22:16.590
<v Speaker 7>You really think that's what's going on.</v>

2761
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

2762
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 7>That'd be fucking fascinating.</v>

2763
01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.220
<v Speaker 7>Would be hilarious to watch.</v>

2764
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:25.140
<v Speaker 7>It'd be hilarious to watch the mad scramble if we really saw actual UFO.</v>

2765
01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:25.861
<v Speaker 7>You believe it.</v>

2766
01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 7>That's why it would be in my opinion,</v>

2767
01:22:27.601 --> 01:22:32.310
<v Speaker 7>I think pandemonium because I think people like you and me and red band and all</v>

2768
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:33.300
<v Speaker 7>of our listeners,</v>

2769
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:33.841
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2770
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:35.000
<v Speaker 7>they will be quite all right.</v>

2771
01:22:35.001 --> 01:22:35.671
<v Speaker 7>Cause you know,</v>

2772
01:22:35.671 --> 01:22:39.540
<v Speaker 7>you'd be crazy not to think that we're alone and um,</v>

2773
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:40.403
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2774
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 7>but I think the great majority of of mankind they would freak out.</v>

2775
01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2776
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:50.960
<v Speaker 7>Or what the aliens really are is the people that are keeping us trapped in the</v>

2777
01:22:52.471 --> 01:22:57.471
<v Speaker 7>simulation and that we live in some really boring ass fucking future where they</v>

2778
01:22:58.921 --> 01:23:02.940
<v Speaker 7>figured out how to make sex is not the way you make babies anymore.</v>

2779
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.100
<v Speaker 7>Everything's done through replication and genetics.</v>

2780
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 7>They have orgasm pills</v>

2781
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.180
<v Speaker 2>so nobody fucks.</v>

2782
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:07.841
<v Speaker 2>Like in the,</v>

2783
01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 2>in the uh,</v>

2784
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.570
<v Speaker 2>judge Dredd Stallone version did that,</v>

2785
01:23:10.571 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>what they did in judge Dredd exactly like dad,</v>

2786
01:23:12.641 --> 01:23:16.030
<v Speaker 2>they devolve to aliens yet and the judge Dredd or evolve rather,</v>

2787
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I know they have to think our big heads is troll shit telepathically and not the</v>

2788
01:23:19.991 --> 01:23:22.840
<v Speaker 2>big eyes cause anything can see the whole space.</v>

2789
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.870
<v Speaker 2>You get to see you if my gear and everything is controlled with their minds.</v>

2790
01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:30.580
<v Speaker 2>So they got like shit for like physiques cause they don't care.</v>

2791
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:31.570
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to get laid.</v>

2792
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be all swol terrible.</v>

2793
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:33.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2794
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 2>aliens never tried to be yoked.</v>

2795
01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:36.543
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck.</v>

2796
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 2>So what if the aliens are us?</v>

2797
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you looked at us and monkeys,</v>

2798
01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:40.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2799
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:45.370
<v Speaker 2>we know for a fact that human beings were some sort of primate that was</v>

2800
01:23:45.371 --> 01:23:46.840
<v Speaker 2>initially different than it is now.</v>

2801
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:47.321
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2802
01:23:47.321 --> 01:23:48.100
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty,</v>

2803
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 2>pretty much agreed upon by the evolutionary theorists that you know,</v>

2804
01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 2>there's our [inaudible],</v>

2805
01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.440
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of different types of human beings,</v>

2806
01:23:56.441 --> 01:23:59.050
<v Speaker 2>and then homo sapiens emerged at one point in time.</v>

2807
01:23:59.200 --> 01:23:59.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2808
01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck create what if you look it out?</v>

2809
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:03.520
<v Speaker 2>We had to somehow or another,</v>

2810
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 2>we were something else at one point in time.</v>

2811
01:24:05.351 --> 01:24:07.190
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole idea behind the,</v>

2812
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 2>the idea of evolution.</v>

2813
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:08.951
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2814
01:24:08.951 --> 01:24:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm too stupid to understand whether or not evolutions real.</v>

2815
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.670
<v Speaker 2>That's an entirely different argument.</v>

2816
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:13.151
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2817
01:24:13.151 --> 01:24:14.140
<v Speaker 2>even Darwin is,</v>

2818
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.900
<v Speaker 2>look how much different we are than a monkey and aliens.</v>

2819
01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Not that much different than us.</v>

2820
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Or You look at a gray alien with the big fucking almond eyes and the big head</v>

2821
01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:25.990
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that it has two arms and two legs and stands up,</v>

2822
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.050
<v Speaker 2>it actually looks more like us than a gorilla does,</v>

2823
01:24:29.410 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2824
01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:31.720
<v Speaker 2>or a monkey with a tail,</v>

2825
01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2826
01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.990
<v Speaker 2>or some of the other crazy primates that we know for sure.</v>

2827
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.823
<v Speaker 2>A real,</v>

2828
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.440
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a backbone and you look at a person and you look at a person,</v>

2829
01:24:38.441 --> 01:24:39.161
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at an alien.</v>

2830
01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 2>I think an alien looks more like a person than about Boone does.</v>

2831
01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2832
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:42.881
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2833
01:24:42.881 --> 01:24:43.331
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2834
01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:44.021
<v Speaker 2>And that is why,</v>

2835
01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:44.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2836
01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Darwin himself,</v>

2837
01:24:45.191 --> 01:24:46.480
<v Speaker 2>he suggested that,</v>

2838
01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:46.601
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2839
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:46.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2840
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 2>he liked his own theory.</v>

2841
01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:49.181
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

2842
01:24:49.181 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 2>in the end he had to conclude there was a missing link.</v>

2843
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 2>There was something that despite everything doesn't make sense,</v>

2844
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:55.240
<v Speaker 2>and today's,</v>

2845
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.073
<v Speaker 2>it's a hologram.</v>

2846
01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 2>That shit ain't real.</v>

2847
01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:57.761
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2848
01:24:57.761 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 2>we're in a simulation.</v>

2849
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Giorgio,</v>

2850
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 2>we exist in a boring ass few.</v>

2851
01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:02.590

<v Speaker 4>That's my people.</v>

2997
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.920
<v Speaker 4>So I'm allowed to shit on them.</v>

2998
01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.050
<v Speaker 4>It's like a black people allowed to use the word nigger.</v>

2999
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Like Chris Rock had that,</v>

3000
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3001
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:38.270
<v Speaker 4>that bit the one of the greatest bits of all time and all comedy.</v>

3002
01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.800
<v Speaker 4>I love black people.</v>

3003
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 4>I hate niggers,</v>

3004
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 4>but that is a genius bit by Chris Rock,</v>

3005
01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:44.270
<v Speaker 4>what I,</v>

3006
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:45.103
<v Speaker 4>my opinion,</v>

3007
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 4>top two or three,</v>

3008
01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.570
<v Speaker 4>all time bits,</v>

3009
01:28:47.571 --> 01:28:50.300
<v Speaker 4>any human being has ever created and he could get away with that.</v>

3010
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Whereas Brian Red band would just get rocks thrown at them.</v>

3011
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:54.320
<v Speaker 6>I had to do a,</v>

3012
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.150
<v Speaker 6>my first kind of black room the other day,</v>

3013
01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:59.680
<v Speaker 6>I did that downtown comedy club and it's black rock.</v>

3014
01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.560
<v Speaker 6>It's not a black room,</v>

3015
01:29:00.561 --> 01:29:01.394
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

3016
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:02.303
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>

3017
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:03.870
<v Speaker 3>it's just people walking on the street going,</v>

3018
01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:04.051
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3019
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 3>let's go see a comedy show.</v>

3020
01:29:04.981 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 3>So there were people there with their whole entire,</v>

3021
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:08.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that was.</v>

3022
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.200
<v Speaker 3>It was German,</v>

3023
01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.273
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3024
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 3>but they sat in the front row tourists and shit.</v>

3025
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:13.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3026
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.570
<v Speaker 3>They're all wearing like their suits and stuff.</v>

3027
01:29:15.571 --> 01:29:16.051
<v Speaker 3>Like they were like,</v>

3028
01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 3>we're going out and seeing a live show.</v>

3029
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

3030
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of people like work there and those silos.</v>

3031
01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3032
01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 3>And so it was,</v>

3033
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.051
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3034
01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:24.480
<v Speaker 3>it was weird because they don't,</v>

3035
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.991
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3036
01:29:24.991 --> 01:29:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a disgusted them,</v>

3038
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 3>like they're talking about sex.</v>

3039
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:29.610
<v Speaker 3>They were just like,</v>

01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand that if people don't know you,</v>

3050
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.010
<v Speaker 3>You have to find your audience.</v>

<v Speaker 3>people will come to see you and they love you because they hear you on the</v>

3054
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:46.470

3055
01:29:46.471 --> 01:29:46.780

<v Speaker 3>you're silly sense of humor.</v>

3058
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 3>But if they did know you,</v>

3059

<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

3061
01:29:51.781 --> 01:29:51.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3062
01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:52.621
<v Speaker 3>there was one point,</v>

3063
01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:53.341
<v Speaker 3>there's a little older,</v>

3064
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 3>like a black lady,</v>

3065
01:29:54.241 --> 01:29:54.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3066
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.780
<v Speaker 3>like pulled out a handkerchief and did the old like patting her forehead with a</v>

3067
01:29:57.781 --> 01:29:58.650
<v Speaker 3>handkerchief.</v>

3068
01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.340
<v Speaker 3>You're standing in front of strangers and you're talking about throwing your</v>

3069
01:30:02.341 --> 01:30:03.980
<v Speaker 3>sperm on hotel walls.</v>

3070
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile they're staying in a hotel and they're like,</v>

3071
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:07.110
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

3072
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:09.720
<v Speaker 3>So they're not going back to the hotel.</v>

3073
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.370
<v Speaker 3>In my head I was doing that bit that,</v>

3074
01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:11.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3075

01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:13.470
<v Speaker 3>about the two or the three pets.</v>

3077
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I have two cats and the dogs and I'm thinking in my head,</v>

3078
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:15.691
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3079
01:30:15.691 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 3>this is a clean bit.</v>

3080
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to pop my cats and dogs and stuff like that.</v>

3081
01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:19.381
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3082
01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:19.711
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3083
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:20.470
<v Speaker 3>no it's not.</v>

3084
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:21.420
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3085
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.660
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

3086
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a funny bit though.</v>

3087
01:30:26.281 --> 01:30:27.540
<v Speaker 3>They got to just relax.</v>

3088
01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Stop being silly bitches.</v>

3089
01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.550
<v Speaker 3>They need to drink more.</v>

3090
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:32.570
<v Speaker 3>I've been hanging out downtown a lot more trauma and it's,</v>

3091
01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.330
<v Speaker 3>it's neat.</v>

3092
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever spent time,</v>

3093
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:35.790
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of time downtown,</v>

3094
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 3>there's some of the best restaurants in la or downtown,</v>

3095
01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:41.430
<v Speaker 3>so the best bars are in town,</v>

3096
01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.910
<v Speaker 3>but what sucks is that it's like bar cool restaurants,</v>

3097
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.170
<v Speaker 3>hot women and fancy people everywhere and then one block over you're going to</v>

3098
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:50.210
<v Speaker 3>get shot and killed it.</v>

3099
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just mixed up.</v>

3100
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:56.280
<v Speaker 3>So there's no like spread out of like wealth and people.</v>

3101
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It's just people mixed in like not enough class structure for,</v>

3102
01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3103
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't like poor people running around fucking up your fun.</v>

3104
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:04.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3105
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:04.950
<v Speaker 3>not just poor people,</v>

3106
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:06.810
<v Speaker 3>like dangerous danger.</v>

3107
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:09.290
<v Speaker 3>What people don't know about downtown La.</v>

3108
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:11.190
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like what Brian's saying is like,</v>

3109
01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:11.351
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3110
01:31:11.351 --> 01:31:12.690
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be around poor people.</v>

3111
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Downtown la has skid row and if you haven't seen skid row,</v>

3112
01:31:16.111 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 3>it is real.</v>

3113
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:21.690
<v Speaker 3>And skid row is a fucking huge street that's filled.</v>

3114
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:22.111
<v Speaker 3>It's nice.</v>

3115
01:31:22.111 --> 01:31:23.610
<v Speaker 3>The streets like half downtown,</v>

3116
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.990
<v Speaker 3>every single block,</v>

3117
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:25.830
<v Speaker 3>every other block.</v>

3118
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:26.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3119
01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:27.570
<v Speaker 3>there's one big area though.</v>

3120
01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:29.120
<v Speaker 3>There's one main area where it is a,</v>

3121
01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:30.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a village of,</v>

3122
01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.090
<v Speaker 3>of homeless people.</v>

3123
01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:32.013
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

3124
01:31:32.190 --> 01:31:32.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3125
01:31:32.431 --> 01:31:33.480
<v Speaker 3>you'd never seen anything like it.</v>

3126
01:31:33.481 --> 01:31:34.081
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about,</v>

3127
01:31:34.081 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 3>you drive down the street,</v>

3128
01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:38.880
<v Speaker 3>there's hundreds if not thousands of people and it's like a Zombie movie.</v>

3129
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>

3130
01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:40.341
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

3131
01:31:40.341 --> 01:31:41.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3132
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if like there's areas where they let them do this and they don't</v>

3133
01:31:44.851 --> 01:31:45.660
<v Speaker 3>fuck with them.</v>

3134
01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.150
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like a place where they can go get food that's nearby.</v>

3135
01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.430
<v Speaker 3>And so like people were camped out in front of that.</v>

3136
01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:50.841
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

3137
01:31:50.841 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3138
01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:54.060
<v Speaker 3>we did a lot of fear factor down there and it's crazy.</v>

3139
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:55.680
<v Speaker 3>He's not exaggerating.</v>

3140
01:31:55.681 --> 01:31:56.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's something where you go,</v>

3141
01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:57.540
<v Speaker 3>oh sure.</v>

3142
01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.170
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3143
01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 3>What fascinates me is if you looked</v>

3144
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.970
<v Speaker 4>at those people and if you look at the people that are just complete fuck ups</v>

3145
01:32:03.971 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 4>and they just can't get their shit together,</v>

3146
01:32:05.711 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking losers.</v>

3147
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:10.870
<v Speaker 4>And you stop and think about the possibility,</v>

3148
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:11.480
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3149
01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:11.721
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3150
01:32:11.721 --> 01:32:13.450
<v Speaker 4>what humans can accomplish.</v>

3151
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:17.920
<v Speaker 4>What a person who builds a nuclear reactor can do with someone who's working at</v>

3152
01:32:17.921 --> 01:32:18.550
<v Speaker 4>cern.</v>

3153
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:20.680
<v Speaker 4>The large Hadron collider is capable of,</v>

3154
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:25.270
<v Speaker 4>they know the person who did the people rather who designed fighter jets and</v>

3155
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 4>drones and the Internet.</v>

3156
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:28.990
<v Speaker 4>And then look at bumps and you go,</v>

3157
01:32:28.991 --> 01:32:29.411
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3158
01:32:29.411 --> 01:32:30.250
<v Speaker 4>people are weird.</v>

3159
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.640
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking strange animal that vary so wildly.</v>

3160
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.800
<v Speaker 4>And yet these things are all surviving.</v>

3161
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if they were like [inaudible] chickens didn't lay eggs or didn't know</v>

3162
01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 4>how to eat with their face,</v>

3163
01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 4>they would be fucking dead.</v>

3164
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3165
01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:43.360
<v Speaker 4>they'd be,</v>

3166
01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.051
<v Speaker 4>that'd be gone.</v>

3167
01:32:44.051 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 4>Every chicken is like almost exactly the same.</v>

3168
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:48.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean they vary so slightly,</v>

3169
01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 4>but human beings,</v>

3170
01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:50.501
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

3171
01:32:50.501 --> 01:32:55.501
<v Speaker 4>we vary wildly in appearance and wildly in our capabilities and our complements</v>

3172
01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:01.210
<v Speaker 4>and our adaptability to our reality and are the,</v>

3173
01:33:01.211 --> 01:33:03.550
<v Speaker 4>are the environments that we establish around ourselves,</v>

3174
01:33:03.551 --> 01:33:03.880
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3175
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.100
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3176
01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.290
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3177
01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 4>the community that were just wildly,</v>

3178
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:07.990
<v Speaker 4>wildly different.</v>

3179
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.980
<v Speaker 4>And one of the arguments that I've heard for the reasons for that is that human</v>

3180
01:33:11.981 --> 01:33:16.330
<v Speaker 4>beings are light dogs in that they look totally different,</v>

3181
01:33:16.331 --> 01:33:17.830
<v Speaker 4>but they can breed with each other,</v>

3182
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:19.260
<v Speaker 4>which doesn't make sense and no,</v>

3183
01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:19.481
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3184
01:33:19.481 --> 01:33:20.410
<v Speaker 4>They're part of the animal world.</v>

3185
01:33:20.411 --> 01:33:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Like an elk can't fuck a deer,</v>

3186
01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:22.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3187
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:23.330
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3188
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.620
<v Speaker 4>the main,</v>

3189
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.453
<v Speaker 4>he could,</v>

3190
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 4>elk is run and shit.</v>

3191
01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:26.381
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3192
01:33:26.381 --> 01:33:27.220
<v Speaker 4>elks are huge.</v>

3193
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:28.450
<v Speaker 4>They want to fuck a deer.</v>

3194
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:28.960
<v Speaker 4>They could,</v>

3195
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

3196
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:30.700
<v Speaker 4>nothing's going to come out of it.</v>

3197
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:34.870
<v Speaker 4>But shack can fuck Bridget damage it and he could get her pregnant and they can</v>

3198
01:33:34.871 --> 01:33:35.501
<v Speaker 4>make a baby.</v>

3199
01:33:35.501 --> 01:33:36.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's legit.</v>

3200
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.293
<v Speaker 4>That's real.</v>

3201
01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:39.820
<v Speaker 4>That only exists in the dog world.</v>

3202
01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:42.880
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why it exists is because we engineered dogs.</v>

3203
01:33:43.210 --> 01:33:44.800
<v Speaker 4>We made them out of one thing.</v>

3204
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:46.300
<v Speaker 4>Dogs used to all be wolves.</v>

3205
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:48.100
<v Speaker 4>We figured out somehow another,</v>

3206
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.450
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>

3207
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:52.030
<v Speaker 4>if you pay attention to genetic engineering of dogs or the,</v>

3208
01:33:52.031 --> 01:33:52.930
<v Speaker 4>or rather the,</v>

3209
01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:53.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3210
01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:53.831
<v Speaker 4>study of,</v>

3211
01:33:53.831 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3212
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:54.600
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3213
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.800
<v Speaker 4>the genetics of dogs,</v>

3214
01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:02.040
<v Speaker 4>they think that all dogs somehow or another came out of wolves and it happened</v>

3215
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Speaker 4>more than 10,000 years ago.</v>

3216
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.390
<v Speaker 4>They don't know how the fuck it was accomplished.</v>

3217
01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:08.051
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3218
01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:13.000
<v Speaker 4>dogs are one of the biggest mysteries when you look at what is possible when you</v>

3219
01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:15.100
<v Speaker 4>take an animal and you turn it into something else.</v>

3220
01:34:15.370 --> 01:34:17.240
<v Speaker 4>The fact that up fucking chill.</v>

3221
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 4>What came out of a wolf.</v>

3222
01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Somehow they thought it was originally they thought it was going to be a bunch</v>

3223
01:34:21.821 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 4>of wild candidates,</v>

3224
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of different kinds of canines that were,</v>

3225
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.060
<v Speaker 4>that were created that that's how a dog was created.</v>

3226
01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 4>And then there's all kind of bread together.</v>

3227
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3228
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3229
01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:30.410
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3230
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.840
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3231
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:31.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3232
01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:31.290
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3233
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3234
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:31.541
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3235
01:34:31.541 --> 01:34:31.681
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3236
01:34:31.681 --> 01:34:31.821
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3237
01:34:31.821 --> 01:34:31.971
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3238
01:34:31.971 --> 01:34:32.121
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3239
01:34:32.121 --> 01:34:32.710
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3240
01:34:32.710 --> 01:34:33.760
<v Speaker 4>no wolves.</v>

3241
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:35.380
<v Speaker 4>They all came from fucking wall.</v>

3242
01:34:35.410 --> 01:34:37.810
<v Speaker 4>He can ease if I'm out both from a wolf,</v>

3243
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:39.760
<v Speaker 4>a fucking wolf.</v>

3244
01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:39.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3245
01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:40.151
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3246
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:40.930
<v Speaker 4>it's wild.</v>

3247
01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:42.310
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely crazy.</v>

3248
01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 4>But that idea is that,</v>

3249
01:34:44.681 --> 01:34:49.681
<v Speaker 4>and for sure wolves rather turning into dogs that was engineered by people we</v>

3250
01:34:49.931 --> 01:34:50.410
<v Speaker 4>made that,</v>

3251
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:50.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>

3252
01:34:50.831 --> 01:34:52.350
<v Speaker 4>they breed bulldogs.</v>

3253
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.320
<v Speaker 4>They do it on purpose.</v>

3254
01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

3255
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:56.230
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

3256
01:34:56.231 --> 01:35:01.231
<v Speaker 4>one of the best pieces of support for the idea that human beings may have been</v>

3257
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:02.624
<v Speaker 4>created,</v>

3258
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 4>that human beings may have been and said not a selection,</v>

3259
01:35:06.351 --> 01:35:07.220
<v Speaker 4>just due to,</v>

3260
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:07.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3261
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:10.400
<v Speaker 4>a branching off in different climates,</v>

3262
01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:11.181
<v Speaker 4>established,</v>

3263
01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:11.601
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

3264
01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:12.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3265
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:14.180
<v Speaker 4>different types of people.</v>

3266
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not,</v>

3267
01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.273
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>

3268
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:19.020
<v Speaker 4>Maybe human beings were made.</v>

3269
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:21.350
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we were created and not just once,</v>

3270
01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:22.184
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was several.</v>

3271
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.830
<v Speaker 6>The ancient alien theory suggests,</v>

3272
01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:24.220
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3273
01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:24.850
<v Speaker 6>that's one of them.</v>

3274
01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:25.090
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3275
01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:28.420
<v Speaker 6>the main tenants of the whole idea bringing the dog thing.</v>

3276
01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:29.410
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3277
01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:33.130
<v Speaker 6>we have brought it in not with the dogs but for example,</v>

3278
01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:38.160
<v Speaker 6>the leopard as an very interesting genetic history where the leopard just</v>

3279
01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.160
<v Speaker 6>basically appeared out of nowhere.</v>

3280
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:43.000
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3281
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:43.750
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3282
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:46.360
<v Speaker 6>what's fascinating to me is that if we look at our history,</v>

3283
01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:46.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3284
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:48.100
<v Speaker 6>genetically speaking,</v>

3285
01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:48.840
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3286
01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.580
<v Speaker 6>in any other species,</v>

3287
01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.000
<v Speaker 6>if a species reaches a certain point,</v>

3288
01:35:55.001 --> 01:35:59.380
<v Speaker 6>what a population dwindles down to such low numbers and there isn't enough</v>

3289
01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.720
<v Speaker 6>genetic material available in the,</v>

3290
01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:02.680
<v Speaker 6>in the gene pool,</v>

3291
01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:06.940
<v Speaker 6>then that species has reached a stadium that's called,</v>

3292
01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:08.170
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3293
01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:12.160
<v Speaker 6>the genetic bottleneck stadium where the genetic bottleneck effect,</v>

3294
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.000
<v Speaker 6>meaning that if that should happen to any species,</v>

3295
01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:19.600
<v Speaker 6>then they are 100% guaranteed to die out.</v>

3296
01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:20.770
<v Speaker 4>So like an inbred dog.</v>

3297
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.631
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3298
01:36:21.631 --> 01:36:22.260
<v Speaker 4>We've all seen in,</v>

3299
01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:25.000
<v Speaker 4>but I have a friend who has an inbred dog and she doesn't want to admit it or</v>

3300
01:36:25.001 --> 01:36:27.070
<v Speaker 4>fucking dogs eyes are that far apart from each other.</v>

3301
01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:28.300
<v Speaker 4>Dog is stupid as shit.</v>

3302
01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:28.901
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

3303
01:36:28.901 --> 01:36:29.681
<v Speaker 4>where did you get this dog?</v>

3304
01:36:29.681 --> 01:36:30.790
<v Speaker 4>She goes like a breeder,</v>

3305
01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:31.810
<v Speaker 4>one of the top breeders,</v>

3306
01:36:31.811 --> 01:36:32.461
<v Speaker 4>my top readers,</v>

3307
01:36:32.461 --> 01:36:33.294
<v Speaker 4>that dog,</v>

3308
01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.190
<v Speaker 4>that dog is brother fucked.</v>

3309
01:36:35.191 --> 01:36:36.180
<v Speaker 4>It's sister fucked.</v>

3310
01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:37.014
<v Speaker 4>It's baby fuck.</v>

3311
01:36:37.150 --> 01:36:37.511
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

3312
01:36:37.511 --> 01:36:38.940
<v Speaker 4>this is a terrible English.</v>

3313
01:36:39.090 --> 01:36:40.470
<v Speaker 6>And what's crazy is that,</v>

3314
01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:41.791
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

3315
01:36:41.791 --> 01:36:43.410
<v Speaker 6>it's a mathematical certainty.</v>

3316
01:36:43.411 --> 01:36:46.850
<v Speaker 6>If I would species reaches that stadium and anybody can go look,</v>

3317
01:36:46.851 --> 01:36:48.870
<v Speaker 6>does online is not something that I came up with.</v>

3318
01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:50.400
<v Speaker 6>They die out period.</v>

3319
01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:54.600
<v Speaker 6>Right now there's one species on planet earth that has gone through two genetic</v>

3320
01:36:54.601 --> 01:36:55.434
<v Speaker 6>bottlenecks.</v>

3321
01:36:56.190 --> 01:36:57.270
<v Speaker 6>US human beings.</v>

3322
01:36:57.570 --> 01:36:58.830
<v Speaker 6>How the hell did we survive?</v>

3323
01:36:58.831 --> 01:36:59.281
<v Speaker 6>How do they know?</v>

3324
01:36:59.281 --> 01:37:03.030
<v Speaker 6>We went through two genetic bottleneck geneticists or have have researched it</v>

3325
01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.560
<v Speaker 6>and it's geneticists that have,</v>

3326
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:05.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3327
01:37:05.130 --> 01:37:08.880
<v Speaker 6>found the evidence for that apparently in Europe and it's been corroborated here</v>

3328
01:37:08.881 --> 01:37:09.714
<v Speaker 6>in the states.</v>

3329
01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:10.350
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3330
01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:10.681
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

3331
01:37:10.681 --> 01:37:10.921
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3332
01:37:10.921 --> 01:37:11.620
<v Speaker 6>to think about,</v>

3333
01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:16.080
<v Speaker 6>and this is why I'm saying that these two stages where that happened,</v>

3334
01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.340
<v Speaker 6>there's no way we could have survived without the guarantee by extraterrestrials</v>

3335
01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.590
<v Speaker 6>that they ensured our survival,</v>

3336
01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:23.573
<v Speaker 6>our breeders.</v>

3337
01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.300
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3338
01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.610
<v Speaker 6>We don't want to accept that idea as they're called in,</v>

3339
01:37:26.611 --> 01:37:26.941
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

3340
01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:27.140
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3341
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.320
<v Speaker 6>prometheus's the engineer's.</v>

3342
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:28.561
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3343
01:37:28.561 --> 01:37:28.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3344
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:30.300
<v Speaker 4>we don't unaccept that idea,</v>

3345
01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:35.100
<v Speaker 4>but yet we do accept the idea that things will continue to improve of course,</v>

3346
01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:39.630
<v Speaker 4>but that does gotta mean it's going to go somewhere.</v>

3347
01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 4>And so how do we know it hasn't already gone somewhere somewhere else?</v>

3348
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.423
<v Speaker 4>Should I know,</v>

3349
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:48.830
<v Speaker 4>to me there's much more evidence that we are arrogant and that we,</v>

3350
01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:49.411
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3351
01:37:49.411 --> 01:37:49.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3352
01:37:49.651 --> 01:37:50.461
<v Speaker 4>in the name of,</v>

3353
01:37:50.461 --> 01:37:55.170
<v Speaker 4>of science and calling things science and academia that we are refusing,</v>

3354
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 4>look at</v>

3355
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 7>the reality that this whole thing is a crazy mystery.</v>

3356
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:04.800
<v Speaker 7>And that although there are some things that science has a absolutely 100%</v>

3357
01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:07.610
<v Speaker 7>proved and these are fascinating things and they should be credited for it and</v>

3358
01:38:07.611 --> 01:38:08.221
<v Speaker 7>thought scientists,</v>

3359
01:38:08.221 --> 01:38:08.680
<v Speaker 7>amazing.</v>

3360
01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:09.630
<v Speaker 7>And don't get me wrong,</v>

3361
01:38:09.631 --> 01:38:10.464
<v Speaker 7>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

3362
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:14.070
<v Speaker 7>But what I am saying is everyone is a little bit fucking cocky.</v>

3363
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:18.810
<v Speaker 7>And when you got to be sure 1000 stone ton stones laying around,</v>

3364
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 7>and when you got all these people that existed thousands of years ago drawing</v>

3365
01:38:23.311 --> 01:38:24.450
<v Speaker 7>shit on cave walls,</v>

3366
01:38:24.451 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 7>it looked like fucking aliens and spaceships.</v>

3367
01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.980
<v Speaker 7>And then these people who were really classic artists who actually could draw</v>

3368
01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:36.981
<v Speaker 7>what they were seeing and had people and seated positions with rocket ships</v>

3369
01:38:37.081 --> 01:38:40.950
<v Speaker 7>flying through the background of a classical like,</v>

3370
01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:41.191
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3371
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:45.450
<v Speaker 7>it looks like a Victorian era painting and they have people flying around in the</v>

3372
01:38:45.451 --> 01:38:46.284
<v Speaker 7>fucking air.</v>

3373
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.333
<v Speaker 7>Like what do they,</v>

3374
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.540
<v Speaker 7>what do they depicting?</v>

3375
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.850
<v Speaker 7>No end what we're saying.</v>

3376
01:38:49.851 --> 01:38:51.300
<v Speaker 7>Or not us of course,</v>

3377
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:55.500
<v Speaker 7>but the mainstream archaeologists that that was nothing else but a figment of</v>

3378
01:38:55.501 --> 01:39:00.150
<v Speaker 7>our ancestors imagination that they had to put something on the walls in order</v>

3379
01:39:00.151 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 7>to make sense of nature.</v>

3380
01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:06.890
<v Speaker 7>Now what an insulting statement is that because our ancestors were a people of</v>

3381
01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:08.430
<v Speaker 7>nature,</v>

3382
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:10.200
<v Speaker 7>they were so familiar with nature,</v>

3383
01:39:10.201 --> 01:39:14.820
<v Speaker 7>you couldn't even fathom how much they were in touch with nature.</v>

3384
01:39:14.821 --> 01:39:17.340
<v Speaker 7>So to say that they had to,</v>

3385
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.090
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3386
01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:21.090
<v Speaker 7>make sure to make shit up in order to make sense of nature,</v>

3387
01:39:21.091 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 7>in my opinion is total bull shit.</v>

3388
01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:23.461
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

3389
01:39:23.461 --> 01:39:24.600
<v Speaker 7>I got one word for you then.</v>

3390
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.673
<v Speaker 7>Ready?</v>

3391
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:27.150
<v Speaker 7>Tell me dragons.</v>

3392
01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:30.300
<v Speaker 7>Dragons is the fuck dragons.</v>

3393
01:39:30.301 --> 01:39:30.680
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

3394
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:30.961
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3395
01:39:30.961 --> 01:39:31.231
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

3396
01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 7>that's another thing that I'll be addressing tonight.</v>

3397
01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:34.310
<v Speaker 7>My,</v>

3398
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.760
<v Speaker 7>my,</v>

3399
01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.593
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

3400
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:38.280
<v Speaker 7>let's everybody let everybody know about that because that is a,</v>

3401
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:39.930
<v Speaker 7>if you want to see Giorgio in person,</v>

3402
01:39:39.931 --> 01:39:41.490
<v Speaker 7>you could touch his hair tonight,</v>

3403
01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.720
<v Speaker 7>tonight,</v>

3404
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:43.260
<v Speaker 7>tonight.</v>

3405
01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:47.130
<v Speaker 7>Los Angeles here in Hollywood at the Universal Sheraton.</v>

3406
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:51.750
<v Speaker 7>Everybody should come out and it's at 7:00 PM it starts and it's a long ass</v>

3407
01:39:51.751 --> 01:39:52.111
<v Speaker 7>lecture,</v>

3408
01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3409
01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:52.651
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3410
01:39:52.651 --> 01:39:52.891
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

3411
01:39:52.891 --> 01:39:53.581
<v Speaker 7>it's a two hour,</v>

3412
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 7>two and a half hour presentation with Q and.</v>

3413
01:39:55.501 --> 01:39:56.250
<v Speaker 7>A.</v>

3414
01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:57.390
<v Speaker 7>We're going to take pictures,</v>

3415
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:59.070
<v Speaker 7>audit autographs afterwards.</v>

3416
01:39:59.071 --> 01:40:00.180
<v Speaker 7>I will show folks,</v>

3417
01:40:00.181 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 7>this is what you do,</v>

3418
01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:01.471
<v Speaker 7>everybody.</v>

3419
01:40:01.471 --> 01:40:04.050
<v Speaker 7>You got to flood this place and every time in the Q and a,</v>

3420
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:06.420
<v Speaker 7>I want to be ready.</v>

3421
01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.550
<v Speaker 7>I was really going to ask olive garden questions.</v>

3422
01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:10.740
<v Speaker 7>Imagine it was,</v>

3423
01:40:10.741 --> 01:40:14.480
<v Speaker 7>the whole show is just assholes from this asking about all of gardens.</v>

3424
01:40:14.481 --> 01:40:14.931
<v Speaker 7>A drag.</v>

3425
01:40:14.931 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 7>I would love it.</v>

3426
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:18.480
<v Speaker 7>The dragon dragons are not a fig Newton of your immigration or</v>

3427
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:22.591
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3428
01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:23.130
<v Speaker 7>they're not.</v>

3429
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:23.311
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3430
01:40:23.311 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 7>no fig Newton enough.</v>

3431
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:25.621
<v Speaker 7>Your immigration.</v>

3432
01:40:25.621 --> 01:40:26.454
<v Speaker 7>I love that.</v>

3433
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:27.271
<v Speaker 7>That's a good one.</v>

3434
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:28.440
<v Speaker 7>It's hilarious that in the future,</v>

3435
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:29.580
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3436
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:30.590
<v Speaker 7>the nose like that upper is,</v>

3437
01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.390
<v Speaker 7>I go saying that Shit Bro.</v>

3438
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.270
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3439
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:34.080
<v Speaker 7>that's a good one.</v>

3440
01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:34.913
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3441
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.281
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3442
01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:39.090
<v Speaker 7>but the thing is we have to ask ourselves with this idea of dragons come from,</v>

3443
01:40:39.091 --> 01:40:40.740
<v Speaker 7>because our ancestors were very,</v>

3444
01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:41.520
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3445
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:41.911
<v Speaker 7>like I said,</v>

3446
01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:46.530
<v Speaker 7>in touch with nature and for them to come up with a story like dragons is quite</v>

3447
01:40:46.531 --> 01:40:50.880
<v Speaker 7>bizarre to me because in many occasions of these stories,</v>

3448
01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:51.990
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3449
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:56.990
<v Speaker 7>those dragons have always been brought into a comparison with fire,</v>

3450
01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 7>smoke and a lot of noise.</v>

3451
01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 7>And exactly.</v>

3452
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:06.160
<v Speaker 7>And because I say rocket ships or you say rocket ships and I agree with you</v>

3453
01:41:06.161 --> 01:41:10.180
<v Speaker 7>because whenever these dragons quote unquote landed,</v>

3454
01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 7>the belly would open up and the gods would walk out of those dragons.</v>

3455
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:17.830
<v Speaker 7>So if a dragon and every culture,</v>

3456
01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:18.821
<v Speaker 7>most,</v>

3457
01:41:18.821 --> 01:41:19.210
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

3458
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 7>most every in in India we have Garuda and uh,</v>

3459
01:41:22.691 --> 01:41:23.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3460
01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 7>the Vimana into vimanas.</v>

3461
01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:28.030
<v Speaker 7>And then in China and in Japan we have to dragons.</v>

3462
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:29.710
<v Speaker 7>But most of the times,</v>

3463
01:41:29.711 --> 01:41:30.820
<v Speaker 7>and also in the Middle Ages,</v>

3464
01:41:30.821 --> 01:41:32.530
<v Speaker 7>in some of the European countries,</v>

3465
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:33.610
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3466
01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:37.000
<v Speaker 7>we have these stories where the bellies would open up and that's where the gods</v>

3467
01:41:37.001 --> 01:41:37.834
<v Speaker 7>would walk out of.</v>

3468
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.650
<v Speaker 7>And guns,</v>

3469
01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:39.371
<v Speaker 7>as we all know,</v>

3470
01:41:39.371 --> 01:41:41.800
<v Speaker 7>lower case g has nothing to do with the university,</v>

3471
01:41:41.801 --> 01:41:42.634
<v Speaker 7>Yada Yada.</v>

3472
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:43.391
<v Speaker 7>So just,</v>

3473
01:41:43.391 --> 01:41:43.661
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3474
01:41:43.661 --> 01:41:46.930
<v Speaker 7>cause gods do not exist the way it's also our,</v>

3475
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:48.550
<v Speaker 7>our term for these things.</v>

3476
01:41:48.551 --> 01:41:49.384
<v Speaker 7>Like when you,</v>

3477
01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:52.630
<v Speaker 7>when you were transcribing Sumerian culture,</v>

3478
01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.850
<v Speaker 7>when you're transcribing their languages,</v>

3479
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 7>it's like there's a lot of it that is very abstract.</v>

3480
01:41:58.271 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 7>It's very hard to wrap your head around exactly what they're saying.</v>

3481
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:03.520
<v Speaker 7>And there's a lot of translations that are really weird.</v>

3482
01:42:03.521 --> 01:42:05.890
<v Speaker 7>So the word God in our eyes,</v>

3483
01:42:05.891 --> 01:42:06.041
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3484
01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:07.120
<v Speaker 7>we're saying it's a god,</v>

3485
01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:08.350
<v Speaker 7>we're saying that this is a god,</v>

3486
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.390
<v Speaker 7>but it's very possible that their,</v>

3487
01:42:10.391 --> 01:42:11.950
<v Speaker 7>their word was a different word,</v>

3488
01:42:11.951 --> 01:42:12.231
<v Speaker 7>like the,</v>

3489
01:42:12.231 --> 01:42:13.300
<v Speaker 7>the Nephilim.</v>

3490
01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:13.601
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

3491
01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:13.901
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3492
01:42:13.901 --> 01:42:15.550
<v Speaker 7>people look at the Nephilim and they,</v>

3493
01:42:15.551 --> 01:42:15.761
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

3494
01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:16.011
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

3495
01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:16.800
<v Speaker 7>they believe,</v>

3496
01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:16.930
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3497
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:17.411
<v Speaker 7>what did it mean?</v>

3498
01:42:17.411 --> 01:42:17.791
<v Speaker 7>What is the,</v>

3499
01:42:17.791 --> 01:42:18.730
<v Speaker 7>the actual,</v>

3500
01:42:19.450 --> 01:42:22.990
<v Speaker 7>like if you wanted to talk to a mainstream biblical scholar,</v>

3501
01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.490
<v Speaker 7>what would they say?</v>

3502
01:42:24.491 --> 01:42:27.910
<v Speaker 7>The nephilim is supposed to represent the fallen angels,</v>

3503
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:28.840
<v Speaker 7>fallen angels,</v>

3504
01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.820
<v Speaker 7>and they will pretty much,</v>

3505
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:34.570
<v Speaker 7>that was the way to get away with inhabiting other gods other than God.</v>

3506
01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:34.931
<v Speaker 7>Well No.</v>

3507
01:42:34.931 --> 01:42:37.390
<v Speaker 7>And they were kind of like God's angels.</v>

3508
01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:37.601
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3509
01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:38.010
<v Speaker 7>there's soup.</v>

3510
01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:38.210
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3511
01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:39.043
<v Speaker 7>solar dope.</v>

3512
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:43.210
<v Speaker 7>They were messengers between the gods and human beings.</v>

3513
01:42:43.211 --> 01:42:47.830
<v Speaker 7>And they weren't angels the way we would think of angels today,</v>

3514
01:42:47.831 --> 01:42:50.380
<v Speaker 7>that they're these ethereal beings that are invisible.</v>

3515
01:42:50.381 --> 01:42:50.980
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

3516
01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:53.920
<v Speaker 7>there's a good one sitting on your left shoulder and a bad one on your right</v>

3517
01:42:53.921 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 7>shoulder and things like that.</v>

3518
01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.200
<v Speaker 7>So it's a,</v>

3519
01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.090
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3520
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.920
<v Speaker 7>angels also have never been depicted with wings until fairly later.</v>

3521
01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.053
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

3522
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:05.351
<v Speaker 7>from,</v>

3523
01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:06.760
<v Speaker 7>from the first times angels,</v>

3524
01:43:06.761 --> 01:43:07.630
<v Speaker 7>wherever even,</v>

3525
01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:08.310
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3526
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:10.870
<v Speaker 7>described or the word angel even came up.</v>

3527
01:43:10.871 --> 01:43:11.170
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3528
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:13.870
<v Speaker 7>Angel comes from the Greek word of Anglos basic,</v>

3529
01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 7>which means middleman or messenger.</v>

3530
01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:17.163
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>

3531
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.831
<v Speaker 7>You know.</v>

3532
01:43:17.831 --> 01:43:22.290
<v Speaker 7>So if we look at the electric we did that we need role do tongue on gallows.</v>

3533
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 7>Angulo suppose a check.</v>

3534
01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 7>I'd be very,</v>

3535
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.280
<v Speaker 7>very turned on by that formula.</v>

3536
01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:32.260
<v Speaker 7>So nationally and you know,</v>

3537
01:43:32.261 --> 01:43:32.710
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

3538
01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:33.640
<v Speaker 7>so the thing is that,</v>

3539
01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:34.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3540
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.830
<v Speaker 7>the wings were only added later,</v>

3541
01:43:35.831 --> 01:43:36.910
<v Speaker 7>but why were they added it?</v>

3542
01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:41.911
<v Speaker 7>Because those messengers that were in touch with those gods had the capability</v>

3543
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.710
<v Speaker 7>of flight and that flight never took place.</v>

3544
01:43:44.711 --> 01:43:49.090
<v Speaker 7>We stupid wings by it took place with some type of a technological machine.</v>

3545
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.860
<v Speaker 7>And of course that is,</v>

3546
01:43:50.861 --> 01:43:51.141
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3547
01:43:51.141 --> 01:43:52.460
<v Speaker 7>subscribing to the engineering</v>

3548
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:52.970
<v Speaker 6>theory.</v>

3549
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Chess,</v>

3550
01:43:53.230 --> 01:43:54.170
<v Speaker 6>some other people.</v>

3551
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:54.690
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3552
01:43:54.690 --> 01:43:58.170
<v Speaker 6>Jetpacks now you watch that or if you um,</v>

3553
01:43:58.730 --> 01:44:00.020
<v Speaker 6>don't know if you have seen this,</v>

3554
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 6>these youtube clips of this dude that has his rocket pack.</v>

3555
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:03.290
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3556
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:07.520
<v Speaker 6>But it's attached to the water with a long tube and it water shoots out of his</v>

3557
01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:08.121
<v Speaker 6>rocket pack.</v>

3558
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:09.140
<v Speaker 6>And so he can be,</v>

3559
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.273
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3560
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:13.640
<v Speaker 6>flying around on that thing for hours.</v>

3561
01:44:13.641 --> 01:44:15.850
<v Speaker 6>And if you look at that white water,</v>

3562
01:44:15.851 --> 01:44:18.800
<v Speaker 6>that ejection of that Whitewater looks like wings,</v>

3563
01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.860
<v Speaker 6>even though it's technology and he looks at things,</v>

3564
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:24.980
<v Speaker 6>it looked like aliens are not going to use that stupid water thing.</v>

3565
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.903
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3566
01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:26.990
<v Speaker 6>What I'm,</v>

3567
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:30.020
<v Speaker 6>my argument is that if somebody watches this,</v>

3568
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:32.990
<v Speaker 6>Ryan found having a technological frame of reference,</v>

3569
01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 6>then they won't know that what they're looking at is a jet pack.</v>

3570
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:38.360
<v Speaker 6>They will think it's something divine.</v>

3571
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:40.670
<v Speaker 6>Well not only that is misunderstood technology.</v>

3572
01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.331
<v Speaker 6>Not only that,</v>

3573
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:46.331
<v Speaker 6>but most likely every single depiction of any of these events was told as a</v>

3574
01:44:47.631 --> 01:44:52.340
<v Speaker 6>spoken word sort of a thing for a thousand years before it was ever written.</v>

3575
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:53.211
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3576
01:44:53.211 --> 01:44:53.921
<v Speaker 6>So when you,</v>

3577
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 6>you talk about the depictions in the Bible you are,</v>

3578
01:44:56.601 --> 01:45:01.250
<v Speaker 6>you are already talking about some really ancient shit anti and the Bible is not</v>

3579
01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 6>even an owner,</v>

3580
01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.870
<v Speaker 6>an original work.</v>

3581
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:06.680
<v Speaker 6>There have been at least six other books,</v>

3582
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:10.970
<v Speaker 6>holy sacred books that were found before the Bible that also tell if a flood</v>

3583
01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 6>story.</v>

3584
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:14.630
<v Speaker 6>So the Bible is not the first sacred book.</v>

3585
01:45:14.631 --> 01:45:15.051
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

3586
01:45:15.051 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 6>it's a very young book.</v>

3587
01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 6>There are other books that go back to 6,000 years especially talking about the</v>

3588
01:45:19.581 --> 01:45:20.390
<v Speaker 6>new testament.</v>

3589
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:21.140
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3590
01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:24.410
<v Speaker 6>Oh literally know the people who chose what's in it,</v>

3591
01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:27.980
<v Speaker 6>Constantine and all these bishops and they put it together and the council of</v>

3592
01:45:27.981 --> 01:45:30.590
<v Speaker 6>Nicea and there was some shit they even left out like they were.</v>

3593
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:31.550
<v Speaker 6>So those are called,</v>

3594
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.800
<v Speaker 6>those are called the epoc and the Apocrypha,</v>

3595
01:45:33.801 --> 01:45:34.750
<v Speaker 6>the apocryphal texts.</v>

3596
01:45:34.751 --> 01:45:37.760
<v Speaker 6>It would have forbidden books of the Bible where for example,</v>

3597
01:45:37.761 --> 01:45:42.761
<v Speaker 6>you have the apocalypse of Abraham in which Abrahams ascension into code and</v>

3598
01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:44.480
<v Speaker 6>code heaviness described.</v>

3599
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:47.330
<v Speaker 6>But if you look at it from a modern day perspective,</v>

3600
01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:52.500
<v Speaker 6>what we can read their reads as if he is entering some type of a spaceship.</v>

3601
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:58.460
<v Speaker 6>He's taken up there and then he is boarding some type of an orbiting space</v>

3602
01:45:58.461 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 6>station.</v>

3603
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.230
<v Speaker 6>And guys,</v>

3604
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.320
<v Speaker 6>I know that this sounds apps so lutely bat shit crazy,</v>

3605
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:09.140
<v Speaker 6>but the questions remain.</v>

3606
01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.890
<v Speaker 6>How did our ancestors describe something like this?</v>

3607
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.860
<v Speaker 6>That if you look at it from a modern day perspective,</v>

3608
01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.590
<v Speaker 6>it reminds of a trip to space,</v>

3609
01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:18.921
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3610
01:46:18.921 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 6>And why is it that all these gods exist in the sky?</v>

3611
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.570
<v Speaker 6>How come these gods,</v>

3612
01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is Gabriel or,</v>

3613
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.051
<v Speaker 6>or rather,</v>

3614
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:27.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3615
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:27.711
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>

3616
01:46:27.711 --> 01:46:29.690
<v Speaker 6>who is Satan was Satan Lucifer.</v>

3617
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:33.680
<v Speaker 6>Lucifer was as original Denise Lucifer.</v>

3618
01:46:33.681 --> 01:46:36.110
<v Speaker 6>That was what he was [inaudible] and that means bringer of light.</v>

3619
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:40.010
<v Speaker 6>And only then he was turning to Satan or into something evil because he was</v>

3620
01:46:40.011 --> 01:46:40.581
<v Speaker 6>outcast.</v>

3621
01:46:40.581 --> 01:46:44.390
<v Speaker 6>And I in the ancient alien theory proposes that,</v>

3622
01:46:44.391 --> 01:46:44.800
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3623
01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:49.130
<v Speaker 6>what we have here is a huge misconception that this has had never anything to do</v>

3624
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 6>with the devil</v>

3625
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 7>or within,</v>

3626
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:50.791
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3627
01:46:50.791 --> 01:46:51.001
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3628
01:46:51.001 --> 01:46:52.800
<v Speaker 7>fighting God or God fighting the devil,</v>

3629
01:46:53.190 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 7>but that there might have been a mutiny on some type of a spaceship and,</v>

3630
01:46:56.971 --> 01:46:57.271
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3631
01:46:57.271 --> 01:46:57.631
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3632
01:46:57.631 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 7>they were cast off not because they were,</v>

3633
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.691
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3634
01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:01.524
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3635
01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:02.311
<v Speaker 7>Satan's,</v>

3636
01:47:02.311 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 7>but because they were,</v>

3637
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:03.701
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3638
01:47:03.701 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 7>we get along mute mutineers you know,</v>

3639
01:47:05.971 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 7>because there were no angels back then.</v>

3640
01:47:09.091 --> 01:47:10.020
<v Speaker 7>There were no,</v>

3641
01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:10.831
<v Speaker 7>there was no,</v>

3642
01:47:10.831 --> 01:47:13.890
<v Speaker 7>there was no thing between God and to devil.</v>

3643
01:47:13.891 --> 01:47:18.000
<v Speaker 7>It's all a total misconception of a total misunderstood visit.</v>

3644
01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:18.780
<v Speaker 7>So they were like,</v>

3645
01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:21.480
<v Speaker 7>not extra terrestrials like the devil's were like Nazis,</v>

3646
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:22.433
<v Speaker 7>like the enemy.</v>

3647
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:25.450
<v Speaker 7>Like if you were going to have like someone who is your,</v>

3648
01:47:25.451 --> 01:47:26.101
<v Speaker 7>your enemy,</v>

3649
01:47:26.101 --> 01:47:28.170
<v Speaker 7>if somebody broke off and you want to describe it,</v>

3650
01:47:28.171 --> 01:47:29.160
<v Speaker 7>those are the evil people.</v>

3651
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:29.850
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3652
01:47:29.850 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 7>you could create,</v>

3653
01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 7>they were still,</v>

3654
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:32.520
<v Speaker 7>they were still at the same,</v>

3655
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.260
<v Speaker 7>the idea that was proposed,</v>

3656
01:47:34.261 --> 01:47:34.800
<v Speaker 7>was it theirs?</v>

3657
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.050
<v Speaker 7>They were still part of the same crew.</v>

3658
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:38.041
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

3659
01:47:38.041 --> 01:47:38.401
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3660
01:47:38.401 --> 01:47:38.941
<v Speaker 7>just like,</v>

3661
01:47:38.941 --> 01:47:39.210
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3662
01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:41.010
<v Speaker 7>during a pirate days and stuff like that,</v>

3663
01:47:41.011 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 7>they would be mutinies going on back then.</v>

3664
01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.480
<v Speaker 7>Well maybe that's why you can start off on an island.</v>

3665
01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:47.520
<v Speaker 7>You burn forever cause they nuked the shit out of you.</v>

3666
01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.420
<v Speaker 7>Maybe that's what it is.</v>

3667
01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:49.253
<v Speaker 7>Well yeah,</v>

3668
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

3669
01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:51.990
<v Speaker 7>You have to ask yourself the question,</v>

3670
01:47:51.991 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 7>where did the ideas for heaven and hell even come from the whole fire and</v>

3671
01:47:55.861 --> 01:47:56.730
<v Speaker 7>brimstone thing?</v>

3672
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:59.400
<v Speaker 7>And if you look at the orange origins of that,</v>

3673
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.821
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3674
01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:02.310
<v Speaker 7>it all came because of flank furnaces,</v>

3675
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 7>flank furnaces.</v>

3676
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:03.901
<v Speaker 7>Are you kidding me?</v>

3677
01:48:03.901 --> 01:48:04.734
<v Speaker 7>What was that?</v>

3678
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:05.260
<v Speaker 7>Couldn't be.</v>

3679
01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:05.490
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

3680
01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:06.300
<v Speaker 7>we're not idiots.</v>

3681
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:07.320
<v Speaker 7>Supervolcanoes yeah.</v>

3682
01:48:07.321 --> 01:48:08.920
<v Speaker 7>Well what about that?</v>

3683
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:09.900
<v Speaker 7>I mean if you looked at that,</v>

3684
01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.550
<v Speaker 7>if you looked inside a volcano,</v>

3685
01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:12.510
<v Speaker 7>you'd think that's hell,</v>

3686
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.493
<v Speaker 7>that's the center.</v>

3687
01:48:13.650 --> 01:48:16.360
<v Speaker 7>But a supervolcano doesn't take off or fly away.</v>

3688
01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:16.920
<v Speaker 7>That's true.</v>

3689
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.191
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3690
01:48:17.191 --> 01:48:17.791
<v Speaker 7>so that's why,</v>

3691
01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:17.971
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3692
01:48:17.971 --> 01:48:20.670
<v Speaker 7>the flank furnaces think to me is very fascinating because they were,</v>

3693
01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.500
<v Speaker 7>they were familiar with furnaces,</v>

3694
01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.990
<v Speaker 7>but they knew as much as anybody,</v>

3695
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.250
<v Speaker 7>furnaces don't fly.</v>

3696
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 7>And all of a sudden we have flying furnaces that are,</v>

3697
01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.840
<v Speaker 7>were bigger and made noise.</v>

3698
01:48:30.841 --> 01:48:31.261
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

3699
01:48:31.261 --> 01:48:33.930
<v Speaker 7>the earth trembled and dust and smoke and craziness.</v>

3700
01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:35.063
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

3701
01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.230
<v Speaker 7>they didn't have the vocabulary.</v>

3702
01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.310
<v Speaker 7>What are these descriptions?</v>

3703
01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:38.431
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3704
01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 7>what are these descriptions of explaining?</v>

3705
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:40.501
<v Speaker 7>It is a,</v>

3706
01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:45.501
<v Speaker 7>is a very tricky thing and it's real easy for people to just go pop,</v>

3707
01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.570
<v Speaker 7>what is this fucking Ufo nonsense?</v>

3708
01:48:48.571 --> 01:48:50.550
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck are these people talking about?</v>

3709
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.970
<v Speaker 7>But if you really just stopped and thought about it for a sec,</v>

3710
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.990
<v Speaker 7>if something did happen ten thousand twelve thousand thirty thousand years ago</v>

3711
01:48:58.991 --> 01:48:59.824
<v Speaker 7>or whatever the fuck it was,</v>

3712
01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 7>how much do you think would be around?</v>

3713
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:04.140
<v Speaker 7>How much evidence would that is?</v>

3714
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.230
<v Speaker 7>That is a wonderful question because a lot of times they're like,</v>

3715
01:49:07.231 --> 01:49:07.411
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3716
01:49:07.411 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 7>how come we've never found a remnant of a machine?</v>

3717
01:49:10.411 --> 01:49:12.480
<v Speaker 7>Or how come we've never found a crashed spaceship?</v>

3718
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 7>Because first of all,</v>

3719
01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:19.140
<v Speaker 7>if it's a technological device and it's left out in the open on your phone,</v>

3720
01:49:19.141 --> 01:49:19.861
<v Speaker 7>I can find my phone.</v>

3721
01:49:19.861 --> 01:49:20.341
<v Speaker 7>If I lose it,</v>

3722
01:49:20.341 --> 01:49:21.320
<v Speaker 7>you can't find your spaceship.</v>

3723
01:49:21.650 --> 01:49:22.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3724
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3725
01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:24.480
<v Speaker 7>but you need out there for 12,000 years,</v>

3726
01:49:24.481 --> 01:49:26.940
<v Speaker 7>it will disintegrate into dust number one.</v>

3727
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.860
<v Speaker 7>So it depends on where it was stored.</v>

3728
01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:30.090
<v Speaker 7>But at the same time,</v>

3729
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.451
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3730
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 7>when was the last time you saw a construction site and after they finished</v>

3731
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:35.010
<v Speaker 7>building everything,</v>

3732
01:49:35.011 --> 01:49:38.460
<v Speaker 7>you walk in there and all the construction materials and the construction tools</v>

3733
01:49:38.610 --> 01:49:39.443
<v Speaker 7>are still there.</v>

3734
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 7>People that build stuff,</v>

3735
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.790
<v Speaker 7>they bring their tools and then when they leave they take their tools with them.</v>

3736
01:49:45.090 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 7>And I think that that was the same,</v>

3737
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 7>those extra terrestrials from thousands of years ago that those tools were</v>

3738
01:49:50.531 --> 01:49:51.550
<v Speaker 7>extremely valuable.</v>

3739
01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.890
<v Speaker 7>So they had an inventory and they said,</v>

3740
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:54.400
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3741
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:55.350
<v Speaker 7>machine x,</v>

3742
01:49:55.351 --> 01:49:55.441
<v Speaker 7>y,</v>

3743
01:49:55.441 --> 01:49:56.274
<v Speaker 7>Z is missing.</v>

3744
01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.153
<v Speaker 7>Go find it.</v>

3745
01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.840
<v Speaker 7>So they hook people up,</v>

3746
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:59.740
<v Speaker 7>they let them use a machine.</v>

3747
01:49:59.741 --> 01:50:00.130
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

3748
01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 7>they build this shit and they all right,</v>

3749
01:50:01.271 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 7>we're out of here.</v>

3750
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.823
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3751
01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 7>That would explain a lot of things.</v>

3752
01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 7>One of the things that would explain is in this,</v>

3753
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

3754
01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.350
<v Speaker 7>this is real,</v>

3755
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:13.350
<v Speaker 7>there are certain pieces of construction that we really have no idea how to like</v>

3756
01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:16.150
<v Speaker 7>they did like the h block that you have right there.</v>

3757
01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 7>And how many of these blocks are in Puma?</v>

3758
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:18.890
<v Speaker 7>Pimco,</v>

3759
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:19.900
<v Speaker 7>the h blocks,</v>

3760
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:20.420
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3761
01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:25.420
<v Speaker 7>I think either 13 or 17 have been found and archeologists are at the moment</v>

3762
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:29.950
<v Speaker 7>trying to reassemble Puma Punko to its former glory because right now,</v>

3763
01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:30.791
<v Speaker 7>and by the way,</v>

3764
01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:33.090
<v Speaker 7>if somebody really or in three d graph,</v>

3765
01:50:33.091 --> 01:50:34.510
<v Speaker 7>so literally ambien.</v>

3766
01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:36.160
<v Speaker 7>And the unfortunate thing is,</v>

3767
01:50:36.161 --> 01:50:37.060
<v Speaker 7>and I've seen pictures,</v>

3768
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:37.990
<v Speaker 7>I haven't been there lately,</v>

3769
01:50:37.991 --> 01:50:42.991
<v Speaker 7>but I've seen pictures through who were sent to me by friends and the blocks are</v>

3770
01:50:43.301 --> 01:50:46.720
<v Speaker 7>being put together completely in the wrong places.</v>

3771
01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:48.140
<v Speaker 7>Why are they moving blocks?</v>

3772
01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:49.013
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3773
01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:51.490
<v Speaker 7>some blocks have disappeared Joe.</v>

3774
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:52.750
<v Speaker 7>Someone stole blocks.</v>

3775
01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.111
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3776
01:50:53.111 --> 01:50:55.290
<v Speaker 7>actually I think that they used to a,</v>

3777
01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:56.163
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3778
01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.750
<v Speaker 7>what do you call these hammers that you use out in the street?</v>

3779
01:50:58.880 --> 01:50:59.560
<v Speaker 7>Jack Hammer.</v>

3780
01:50:59.560 --> 01:50:59.930
<v Speaker 7>Jackhammer.</v>

3781
01:50:59.930 --> 01:51:00.810
<v Speaker 7>So use jackhammers.</v>

3782
01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:04.510
<v Speaker 7>And they basically just disintegrated some of these blocks because they didn't</v>

3783
01:51:04.511 --> 01:51:06.610
<v Speaker 7>fit into the scheme what they're trying to do.</v>

3784
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:10.780
<v Speaker 7>And it seems as if some of these professors or scientists have never played</v>

3785
01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:13.750
<v Speaker 7>lego's a treacherous tetris in their entire lives.</v>

3786
01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.321
<v Speaker 7>Wait a minute,</v>

3787
01:51:14.321 --> 01:51:14.680
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute.</v>

3788
01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:16.320
<v Speaker 7>What a dumb idea to modes.</v>

3789
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.601
<v Speaker 7>Horse.</v>

3790
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:17.211
<v Speaker 7>A sensor.</v>

3791
01:51:17.211 --> 01:51:18.044
<v Speaker 7>Chabot,</v>

3792
01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:18.331
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

3793
01:51:18.331 --> 01:51:18.550
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3794
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:21.550
<v Speaker 7>it's so stupid because it's going to confuse our ancestors.</v>

3795
01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:21.941
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3796
01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:22.301
<v Speaker 7>excuse me,</v>

3797
01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 7>our predecessor thing,</v>

3798
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 7>our heirs,</v>

3799
01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.331
<v Speaker 7>our heirs.</v>

3800
01:51:25.331 --> 01:51:25.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3801
01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:26.381
<v Speaker 7>Well the thing is that,</v>

3802
01:51:26.381 --> 01:51:27.214
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3803
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:30.140
<v Speaker 7>predecessor tunecore's to steal the foma Puente cu.</v>

3804
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:30.470
<v Speaker 7>Dot.</v>

3805
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:33.100
<v Speaker 7>Mine is a place that is in ruins.</v>

3806
01:51:33.130 --> 01:51:34.090
<v Speaker 7>It's not,</v>

3807
01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.350
<v Speaker 7>it's not like a clear,</v>

3808
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:36.341
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

3809
01:51:36.341 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 7>So then of course you also have to have to ask yourself the question,</v>

3810
01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.290
<v Speaker 7>how the hell was it destroyed?</v>

3811
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:43.420
<v Speaker 7>How did he get into this stage?</v>

3812
01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:46.090
<v Speaker 7>Unless they must've been some deliberate destruction.</v>

3813
01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:46.451
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3814
01:51:46.451 --> 01:51:47.830
<v Speaker 7>for a giant,</v>

3815
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:51.400
<v Speaker 7>giant cataclysmic event,</v>

3816
01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.353
<v Speaker 7>who knows?</v>

3817
01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:53.200
<v Speaker 7>It could have been easily.</v>

3818
01:51:53.201 --> 01:51:57.130
<v Speaker 7>And maybe that also explains why at 12,000 feet,</v>

3819
01:51:57.131 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 7>maybe the environment was different because one of the things that they're</v>

3820
01:51:59.771 --> 01:52:04.771
<v Speaker 7>saying about the pre dinosaur era and one of the reasons why they think that</v>

3821
01:52:05.411 --> 01:52:08.880
<v Speaker 7>animals may have been so large back then and so much different than they are</v>

3822
01:52:08.881 --> 01:52:09.610
<v Speaker 7>today,</v>

3823
01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:14.290
<v Speaker 7>is that the actual atmosphere may have been different then than it is today.</v>

3824
01:52:14.290 --> 01:52:15.940
<v Speaker 7>And the impact in,</v>

3825
01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:16.774
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3826
01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:17.051
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3827
01:52:17.051 --> 01:52:17.590
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3828
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:20.830
<v Speaker 7>the Yucatan that they believe happened 65 billion years ago,</v>

3829
01:52:20.831 --> 01:52:22.540
<v Speaker 7>that killed off everything.</v>

3830
01:52:22.541 --> 01:52:23.430
<v Speaker 7>And then from there,</v>

3831
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 7>flowering plants emerged.</v>

3832
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:25.451
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

3833
01:52:25.451 --> 01:52:29.230
<v Speaker 7>the emergence of mammals is as the higher intellect.</v>

3834
01:52:29.231 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 7>And dominant part of the food chain.</v>

3835
01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 7>But before all that they'd thinking that the,</v>

3836
01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:34.780
<v Speaker 7>the environment might have been different.</v>

3837
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:36.070
<v Speaker 7>And if that is the case,</v>

3838
01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.500
<v Speaker 7>maybe a at 12,000 feet,</v>

3839
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:38.831
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3840
01:52:38.831 --> 01:52:41.320
<v Speaker 7>a long fucking time ago there was more oxygen up there.</v>

3841
01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.850
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it was a different wash here.</v>

3842
01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:43.900
<v Speaker 7>Here's the thing that,</v>

3843
01:52:43.901 --> 01:52:44.141
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3844
01:52:44.141 --> 01:52:49.141
<v Speaker 7>some people have that that entire Indian plateau of the Bolivian highlands was</v>

3845
01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:54.980
<v Speaker 7>at one point way lower than it currently is.</v>

3846
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:59.330
<v Speaker 7>And if that is the case then you have to ask yourself the question,</v>

3847
01:52:59.331 --> 01:53:01.130
<v Speaker 7>when was that in number two?</v>

3848
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.370
<v Speaker 7>All around this entire plateau up there,</v>

3849
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 7>you find fossils of a saltwater fish.</v>

3850
01:53:09.230 --> 01:53:14.230
<v Speaker 7>So at some point that whole thing had to have been covered with ocean water and</v>

3851
01:53:15.411 --> 01:53:15.920
<v Speaker 7>where are,</v>

3852
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:16.281
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3853
01:53:16.281 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 7>at least a thousand miles inland from the Pacific Ocean.</v>

3854
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:22.310
<v Speaker 7>So it is such a mind fuck,</v>

3855
01:53:22.311 --> 01:53:23.210
<v Speaker 7>it's not even funny.</v>

3856
01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.620
<v Speaker 7>So how many years,</v>

3857
01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:25.670
<v Speaker 7>like I know there was,</v>

3858
01:53:25.671 --> 01:53:29.870
<v Speaker 7>is it Tia Naco where they said it was close to what they believe or what are the</v>

3859
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:33.410
<v Speaker 7>alternative theories is it was close to 28,000 years.</v>

3860
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.400
<v Speaker 7>20,000 years ago.</v>

3861
01:53:34.401 --> 01:53:35.300
<v Speaker 7>It was on the water.</v>

3862
01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.193
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

3863
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.621
<v Speaker 7>Oh No,</v>

3864
01:53:36.621 --> 01:53:36.831
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3865
01:53:36.831 --> 01:53:37.011
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3866
01:53:37.011 --> 01:53:37.821
<v Speaker 7>no near the water.</v>

3867
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:42.080
<v Speaker 7>But Puma Pimco might've been a port on the water at some point,</v>

3868
01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:44.030
<v Speaker 7>a harbor of some point in time,</v>

3869
01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:45.530
<v Speaker 7>but that would mean that,</v>

3870
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 7>that they had there've been ocean water at 12,000,</v>

3871
01:53:48.741 --> 01:53:50.570
<v Speaker 7>500 feet above sea level unless,</v>

3872
01:53:50.571 --> 01:53:50.871
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3873
01:53:50.871 --> 01:53:55.871
<v Speaker 7>there was a cataclysmic event that raised the entire plateau in a relatively</v>

3874
01:53:56.211 --> 01:53:57.590
<v Speaker 7>short period of time.</v>

3875
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.491
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

3876
01:53:58.491 --> 01:54:02.570
<v Speaker 7>why war that would it do it uniformly so that everything was like level when it</v>

3877
01:54:02.571 --> 01:54:03.404
<v Speaker 7>got up to him.</v>

3878
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:04.790
<v Speaker 7>I am not a geologist,</v>

3879
01:54:04.791 --> 01:54:05.630
<v Speaker 7>I have no idea.</v>

3880
01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:09.940
<v Speaker 7>But what's also fascinating is that right next to a Puma,</v>

3881
01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:12.320
<v Speaker 7>Puma [inaudible] is Lake Titicaca,</v>

3882
01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 7>which is the highest navigable lake in the world.</v>

3883
01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:16.550
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

3884
01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3885
01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.780
<v Speaker 7>people have also suggested that,</v>

3886
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:20.070
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3887
01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:25.070
<v Speaker 7>to Lake Titicaca was so big that it actually connected with Puma Punahou and</v>

3888
01:54:25.311 --> 01:54:29.090
<v Speaker 7>that Puma punker was merely a harbor by a lake and not by the ocean.</v>

3889
01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.110
<v Speaker 7>That's what I was thinking of.</v>

3890
01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:30.761
<v Speaker 7>That was the,</v>

3891
01:54:30.761 --> 01:54:30.851
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3892
01:54:30.851 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 7>the store that I had read.</v>

3893
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.601
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't,</v>

3894
01:54:32.601 --> 01:54:33.141
<v Speaker 7>it was a,</v>

3895
01:54:33.141 --> 01:54:33.820
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't Tinoco.</v>

3896
01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 7>Nahko was uh,</v>

3897
01:54:35.250 --> 01:54:36.051
<v Speaker 7>the other one will say it again.</v>

3898
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:36.300
<v Speaker 7>Puma.</v>

3899
01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:36.610
<v Speaker 7>Puma.</v>

3900
01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:38.720
<v Speaker 7>Which Gacaca?</v>

3901
01:54:38.721 --> 01:54:39.080
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3902
01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.480
<v Speaker 7>that's what I remembered that I was trying to recall.</v>

3903
01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:43.460
<v Speaker 7>So how far away is that?</v>

3904
01:54:43.461 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 7>Like in miles,</v>

3905
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:45.183
<v Speaker 7>but 50,</v>

3906
01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:45.641
<v Speaker 7>50.</v>

3907
01:54:45.641 --> 01:54:46.700
<v Speaker 7>That's shit that ain't show.</v>

3908
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

3909
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 7>If you think about how many different times there's,</v>

3910
01:54:50.301 --> 01:54:50.500
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3911
01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:50.850
<v Speaker 7>been,</v>

3912
01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:51.080
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3913
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.520
<v Speaker 7>lakes that we found that a dry lake beds like groom lake where area 51 is used</v>

3914
01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:56.250
<v Speaker 7>to be a lake.</v>

3915
01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3916
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.931
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3917
01:54:56.931 --> 01:54:57.950
<v Speaker 7>and there there was,</v>

3918
01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:59.420
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of dry lake beds,</v>

3919
01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.150
<v Speaker 7>grand the world and used to be a body of water.</v>

3920
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.490
<v Speaker 7>What is it at the bottom and some spots still?</v>

3921
01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:04.621
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3922
01:55:04.621 --> 01:55:04.770
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3923
01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:05.260
<v Speaker 7>the rivers,</v>

3924
01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:06.500
<v Speaker 7>you've got the Colorado River going,</v>

3925
01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:07.670
<v Speaker 7>but it used to be even bigger,</v>

3926
01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:09.200
<v Speaker 7>something cut through all that shit,</v>

3927
01:55:09.201 --> 01:55:12.350
<v Speaker 7>which is incredible if you look at the Grand Canyon and think that that was all</v>

3928
01:55:12.351 --> 01:55:13.820
<v Speaker 7>carved by all river.</v>

3929
01:55:13.821 --> 01:55:15.620
<v Speaker 7>Like what a saying,</v>

3930
01:55:15.630 --> 01:55:16.463
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

3931
01:55:16.650 --> 01:55:18.820
<v Speaker 7>river and fucking carved this shit to the ground.</v>

3932
01:55:18.821 --> 01:55:20.030
<v Speaker 7>How long did that take?</v>

3933
01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:20.900
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

3934
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:25.900
<v Speaker 7>It's really tough for us to wrap our heads around the idea of 28,000 years ago</v>

3935
01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:26.460
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>

3936
01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:26.931
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

3937
01:55:26.931 --> 01:55:31.340
<v Speaker 7>and then we miles a lake ain't shit for 20 and then we claim that we know</v>

3938
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:31.911
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

3939
01:55:31.911 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 7>She to me the moment someone claims to have all the answers run for the hills</v>

3940
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:37.130
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3941
01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 7>Well it's,</v>

3942
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.353
<v Speaker 7>nobody knows.</v>

3943
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 7>The real issue is a lot of times we have a few things that we know for a fact</v>

3944
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:45.330
<v Speaker 7>and then we start teaching those few things.</v>

3945
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:46.550
<v Speaker 7>And then as in,</v>

3946
01:55:46.710 --> 01:55:49.140
<v Speaker 7>especially in terms of ancient history,</v>

3947
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of speculation.</v>

3948
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.470
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of,</v>

3949
01:55:52.471 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 7>well what we think is this and once they start teaching that,</v>

3950
01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 7>that's when things get tricky.</v>

3951
01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:00.810
<v Speaker 7>Because if you have a theory and you teach that theory and then all sudden some</v>

3952
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:04.710
<v Speaker 7>other shit comes up that might make all that Shit you've been teaching for 10</v>

3953
01:56:04.711 --> 01:56:05.040
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>

3954
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 7>Utter Horse Shit,</v>

3955
01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:08.520
<v Speaker 7>that's hard to accept for a lot of people.</v>

3956
01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:12.300
<v Speaker 7>Well cause it's their ego is attached to what they believe in their,</v>

3957
01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:12.661
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3958
01:56:12.661 --> 01:56:13.650
<v Speaker 7>attached to what they're teaching.</v>

3959
01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:14.610
<v Speaker 7>Oh f absolutely.</v>

3960
01:56:14.611 --> 01:56:16.350
<v Speaker 7>All of that is a problem in academia isn't it?</v>

3961
01:56:16.351 --> 01:56:17.190
<v Speaker 7>And when it comes to,</v>

3962
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:17.821
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3963
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:18.960
<v Speaker 7>all these ancient sites,</v>

3964
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.830
<v Speaker 7>of course,</v>

3965
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:22.200
<v Speaker 7>and Ellen with likened it to the same thing where,</v>

3966
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:22.771
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3967
01:56:22.771 --> 01:56:23.520
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter.</v>

3968
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.300
<v Speaker 7>Here we are in Pasadena and there's the Huntington Library right here.</v>

3969
01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 7>And the Huntington Library has some of the most precious books in the world.</v>

3970
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.210
<v Speaker 7>Some of them are textbooks,</v>

3971
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:38.430
<v Speaker 7>beautifully leather bound textbooks that were used at universities at the best</v>

3972
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.290
<v Speaker 7>universities in the world,</v>

3973
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:40.831
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3974
01:56:40.831 --> 01:56:43.170
<v Speaker 7>in London or here in the states,</v>

3975
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.610
<v Speaker 7>or uh,</v>

3976
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.930
<v Speaker 7>well not back then the states,</v>

3977
01:56:45.931 --> 01:56:46.764
<v Speaker 7>but uh,</v>

3978
01:56:46.770 --> 01:56:47.101
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3979
01:56:47.101 --> 01:56:52.101
<v Speaker 7>at different places of education and those books today,</v>

3980
01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.230
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

3981
01:56:53.230 --> 01:56:53.470
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

3982
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:57.300
<v Speaker 7>you look at them and I challenge you to find anything in there that's a science</v>

3983
01:56:57.301 --> 01:56:59.610
<v Speaker 7>book that still holds true today.</v>

3984
01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3985
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:00.630
<v Speaker 7>Yet,</v>

3986
01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:05.630
<v Speaker 7>those books were printed so that the students at the universities could read and</v>

3987
01:57:05.911 --> 01:57:08.040
<v Speaker 7>study and perform tests on these things.</v>

3988
01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 7>And that was the cutting edge of science back in the day.</v>

3989
01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:14.063
<v Speaker 7>And today,</v>

3990
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:14.911
<v Speaker 7>nothing holds true.</v>

3991
01:57:14.911 --> 01:57:19.530
<v Speaker 7>So I think it's going to be the same thing about the way less stuff that we know</v>

3992
01:57:19.531 --> 01:57:19.770
<v Speaker 7>about.</v>

3993
01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:20.603
<v Speaker 7>We'll be wrong,</v>

3994
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:25.590
<v Speaker 7>but there will be things that a hundred years from now that we think today is</v>

3995
01:57:25.591 --> 01:57:26.310
<v Speaker 7>true.</v>

3996
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:27.270
<v Speaker 7>A hundred years from now,</v>

3997
01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.300
<v Speaker 7>we will know that in fact we were wrong.</v>

3998
01:57:30.690 --> 01:57:33.900
<v Speaker 7>Do you think that if the shit hits the fan and the aliens come,</v>

3999
01:57:33.901 --> 01:57:34.441
<v Speaker 7>the government,</v>

4000
01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:35.190
<v Speaker 7>we'll call you,</v>

4001
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:38.130
<v Speaker 7>say Giorgio you want to come down here and take care of this?</v>

4002
01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:40.920
<v Speaker 7>We need someone who understands what the fuck is going on.</v>

4003
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:41.220
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

4004
01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:42.053
<v Speaker 7>I'll go.</v>

4005
01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:42.631
<v Speaker 7>But no,</v>

4006
01:57:42.631 --> 01:57:43.710
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it's going to happen.</v>

4007
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:44.120
<v Speaker 7>No Way.</v>

4008
01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:49.120
<v Speaker 7>Because you volunteering yourself as the representative of human beings to the</v>

4009
01:57:49.741 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 7>extra show world that has already actually been taken care of by someone at the</v>

4010
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:53.671
<v Speaker 7>UN,</v>

4011
01:57:53.671 --> 01:57:54.504
<v Speaker 7>believe it or not.</v>

4012
01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.231
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>

4013
01:57:55.231 --> 01:57:55.591
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

4014
01:57:55.591 --> 01:57:56.380
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

4015
01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.210
<v Speaker 7>They um,</v>

4016
01:57:57.210 --> 01:57:57.481
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4017
01:57:57.481 --> 01:57:57.580
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

4018
01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:57.960
<v Speaker 7>he's the,</v>

4019
01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.540
<v Speaker 7>he's the liaison between aliens and human being.</v>

4020
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:01.150
<v Speaker 7>That's his gig.</v>

4021
01:58:01.150 --> 01:58:01.990
<v Speaker 7>Should the case comes,</v>

4022
01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:02.880
<v Speaker 7>you have another job too.</v>

4023
01:58:02.881 --> 01:58:03.461
<v Speaker 7>I hope he has no,</v>

4024
01:58:03.461 --> 01:58:04.294
<v Speaker 7>no idea.</v>

4025
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:05.990
<v Speaker 7>I hope this isn't something we're actually finish things.</v>

4026
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.380
<v Speaker 7>It's so funny that you know,</v>

4027
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:09.810
<v Speaker 7>they have not chosen somebody who,</v>

4028
01:58:09.811 --> 01:58:10.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4029
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.950
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4030
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.420
<v Speaker 7>has chosen this as a,</v>

4031
01:58:12.810 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 7>the stuff that they do.</v>

4032
01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:14.760
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

4033
01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:15.031
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4034
01:58:15.031 --> 01:58:16.890
<v Speaker 7>cause I think that might be important,</v>

4035
01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:17.250
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

4036
01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:17.521
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4037
01:58:17.521 --> 01:58:18.390
<v Speaker 7>call me crazy.</v>

4038
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:19.121
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4039
01:58:19.121 --> 01:58:19.350
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4040
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:22.470
<v Speaker 7>maybe the guy to us as the UN fascinating.</v>

4041
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:23.970
<v Speaker 7>A closet alien dude.</v>

4042
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.210
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4043
01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:25.043
<v Speaker 7>who knows?</v>

4044
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:27.000
<v Speaker 7>You mad that you could get that Gig.</v>

4045
01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:27.500
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

4046
01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:27.720
<v Speaker 7>what?</v>

4047
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:28.553
<v Speaker 7>Like a girl.</v>

4048
01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

4049
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:31.860
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even get to audition for that role.</v>

4050
01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 7>And now he's even Chelsea.</v>

4051
01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:36.090
<v Speaker 7>And I just think it's funny,</v>

4052
01:58:36.091 --> 01:58:36.511
<v Speaker 7>just like,</v>

4053
01:58:36.511 --> 01:58:37.260
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4054
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.220
<v Speaker 7>one of the first,</v>

4055
01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:38.650
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4056
01:58:38.650 --> 01:58:39.450
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4057
01:58:39.450 --> 01:58:40.231
<v Speaker 7>alien movies or,</v>

4058
01:58:40.231 --> 01:58:40.460
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>

4059
01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 7>or science fiction movies that,</v>

4060
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:42.724
<v Speaker 7>that</v>

4061
01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:44.133
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>

4062
01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:44.870
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4063
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:48.640
<v Speaker 6>proposed the real idea in promethium if you go out there,</v>

4064
01:58:48.641 --> 01:58:52.900
<v Speaker 6>you have to bring at least one archaeologist prometheus's the first movie,</v>

4065
01:58:52.901 --> 01:58:56.980
<v Speaker 6>who has done that in every other a science fiction movie that you have.</v>

4066
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:58.810
<v Speaker 6>There's never an archeologist on board,</v>

4067
01:58:58.960 --> 01:58:59.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4068
01:58:59.290 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 6>and to me it's like,</v>

4069
01:59:00.161 --> 01:59:00.911
<v Speaker 6>are you kidding me?</v>

4070
01:59:00.911 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 6>That's the first person that you go somewhere because of comparison of our past</v>

4071
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:08.680
<v Speaker 6>with what's whatever's going on at the destination planet.</v>

4072
01:59:08.890 --> 01:59:12.010
<v Speaker 6>But instead they bring a whole bunch of Yahoos with them that,</v>

4073
01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:12.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4074
01:59:12.371 --> 01:59:13.600
<v Speaker 6>of course it's all entertainment.</v>

4075
01:59:13.601 --> 01:59:14.410
<v Speaker 6>I understand.</v>

4076
01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:16.390
<v Speaker 6>But I think that the whole Prometheans thing,</v>

4077
01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:16.901
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

4078
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:17.860
<v Speaker 6>it's a beautiful movie.</v>

4079
01:59:17.861 --> 01:59:19.150
<v Speaker 6>It's a great entertainment.</v>

4080
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like it.</v>

4081
01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:20.751
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

4082
01:59:20.751 --> 01:59:21.261
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

4083
01:59:21.261 --> 01:59:22.094
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't like it.</v>

4084
01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I thought there's just too many hokey fucking moments in it.</v>

4085
01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:25.590
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4086
01:59:25.590 --> 01:59:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought it could have been an incredible movie,</v>

4087
01:59:27.981 --> 01:59:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed like there's seemed like some,</v>

4088
01:59:30.650 --> 01:59:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

4089
01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I would love to sit down with Ridley Scott and get high with him and go,</v>

4090
01:59:33.111 --> 01:59:33.944
<v Speaker 2>what happened man?</v>

4091
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Get him on the podcast.</v>

4092
01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Scott's not doing my fucking podcast.</v>

4093
01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a surprise guys.</v>

4094
01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.193
<v Speaker 2>Podcasts.</v>

4095
01:59:41.770 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Most especially not after I told them that I don't like for me.</v>

4096
01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4097
01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:45.320
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>

4098
01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4099
01:59:45.650 --> 01:59:46.940
<v Speaker 2>fucking punk ass bitch.</v>

4100
01:59:46.941 --> 01:59:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Did fear factor shitting on Prometheans but a,</v>

4101
01:59:49.641 --> 01:59:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I loved alien.</v>

4102
01:59:50.721 --> 01:59:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I love gladiator.</v>

4103
01:59:51.651 --> 01:59:52.431
<v Speaker 2>I think he's amazing.</v>

4104
01:59:52.431 --> 01:59:53.390
<v Speaker 2>He does amazing movies.</v>

4105
01:59:53.391 --> 01:59:54.021
<v Speaker 2>But that movie,</v>

4106
01:59:54.021 --> 01:59:54.560
<v Speaker 2>it just was,</v>

4107
01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:55.640
<v Speaker 2>it was okay.</v>

4108
01:59:55.641 --> 01:59:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I would even see it again if it was on TV or something.</v>

4109
01:59:57.681 --> 02:00:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I might even buy the DVD just to watch it for a little while,</v>

4110
02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:01.021
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

4111
02:00:01.021 --> 02:00:02.180
<v Speaker 2>it could have been so much more.</v>

4112
02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:03.163
<v Speaker 2>But it was a,</v>

4113
02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.640
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind it that,</v>

4114
02:00:04.670 --> 02:00:05.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4115
02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.890
<v Speaker 2>we were engineered and created.</v>

4116
02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:07.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

4117
02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.530
<v Speaker 2>they handled that I thought pretty well.</v>

4118
02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I thought they handled.</v>

4119
02:00:10.721 --> 02:00:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4120
02:00:11.210 --> 02:00:11.541
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

4121
02:00:11.541 --> 02:00:12.380
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating.</v>

4122
02:00:12.381 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 2>You know the concept behind it though,</v>

4123
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:16.430
<v Speaker 2>the black stuff that becomes the alien,</v>

4124
02:00:16.431 --> 02:00:19.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a little kind of a pain the ass and it was hard to wrap your head</v>

4125
02:00:19.251 --> 02:00:19.551
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

4126
02:00:19.551 --> 02:00:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Like they have a chart of the,</v>

4127
02:00:21.050 --> 02:00:23.360
<v Speaker 2>the morphology and like how,</v>

4128
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:24.950
<v Speaker 2>how people become that thing,</v>

4129
02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:26.090
<v Speaker 2>how that thing is created,</v>

4130
02:00:26.091 --> 02:00:28.550
<v Speaker 2>how the actual alien from the first movie aliens,</v>

4131
02:00:28.551 --> 02:00:29.930
<v Speaker 2>he have actually charted it out.</v>

4132
02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Like where it comes from like this.</v>

4133
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Like when a man gets in,</v>

4134
02:00:33.191 --> 02:00:34.790
<v Speaker 2>check that out and gives it to a woman,</v>

4135
02:00:34.791 --> 02:00:37.790
<v Speaker 2>then it creates this kind of a fucking octopus looking thing.</v>

4136
02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:42.590
<v Speaker 2>And when the woman got pregnant that's why it's because it was a man who got</v>

4137
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:43.580
<v Speaker 2>infected.</v>

4138
02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Then he impregnated her and then the infection takes that form so that it</v>

4139
02:00:47.271 --> 02:00:52.271
<v Speaker 2>produces one type of offspring or if one of the engineer's gets infected then it</v>

4140
02:00:52.371 --> 02:00:54.350
<v Speaker 2>produces another type of thing.</v>

4141
02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's like they've all plotted it all out.</v>

4142
02:00:57.651 --> 02:00:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Like at the end when the end,</v>

4143
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:59.480
<v Speaker 2>spoiler,</v>

4144
02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:00.313
<v Speaker 2>spoiler alert,</v>

4145
02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:01.970
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be saying any spoilers.</v>

4146
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't tell people what happened.</v>

4147
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:05.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad way,</v>

4148
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:07.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's just not as good as alien alien one.</v>

4149
02:01:07.461 --> 02:01:09.530
<v Speaker 2>It's the shit still to this day,</v>

4150
02:01:09.531 --> 02:01:13.490
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest movies of all time aliens was good to aliens is good and</v>

4151
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:14.750
<v Speaker 2>differently different but good.</v>

4152
02:01:15.070 --> 02:01:15.903
<v Speaker 2>Very Fun.</v>

4153
02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>But the aliens were too easy to kill.</v>

4154
02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:18.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what pissed me off.</v>

4155
02:01:18.171 --> 02:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like all of a sudden you can kill him like that because the first one,</v>

4156
02:01:20.961 --> 02:01:24.170
<v Speaker 2>that one alien was super sneaky and fucked everybody up.</v>

4157
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Now they're like real obvious in your face running at you.</v>

4158
02:01:28.370 --> 02:01:28.581
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4159
02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

4160
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Like they were like masters.</v>

4161
02:01:32.001 --> 02:01:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Like the first alien was always creeping up on bitches and then jacking him and</v>

4162
02:01:35.481 --> 02:01:39.500
<v Speaker 2>the second one like and is running at you and then you have to shot it.</v>

4163
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4164
02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:41.330
<v Speaker 2>it was still a fun movie,</v>

4165
02:01:41.331 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 2>but in my opinion,</v>

4166
02:01:42.891 --> 02:01:45.170
<v Speaker 2>they change the characteristics of the thing.</v>

4167
02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>If aliens was,</v>

4168
02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:52.180
<v Speaker 2>all these things were super clever and all these things are really stealthy and</v>

4169
02:01:52.191 --> 02:01:52.650
<v Speaker 2>they moved on,</v>

4170
02:01:52.650 --> 02:01:54.800
<v Speaker 2>that would've been an even more terrifying movie.</v>

4171
02:01:54.801 --> 02:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

4172
02:01:55.210 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It was really hard to kill them.</v>

4173
02:01:57.230 --> 02:01:59.240
<v Speaker 2>But they're just out there running at you and you shoot them.</v>

4174
02:01:59.330 --> 02:01:59.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4175
02:01:59.541 --> 02:02:01.730
<v Speaker 2>it seems change the whole fucking movie,</v>

4176
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4177
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

4178
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the advent of video games,</v>

4179
02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:05.940
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>

4180
02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:06.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

4181
02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Became like a,</v>

4182
02:02:08.490 --> 02:02:08.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4183
02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:09.980
<v Speaker 2>aliens vs Predator.</v>

4184
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:10.843
<v Speaker 2>How'd that happen?</v>

4185
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

4186
02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Terrible,</v>

4187
02:02:12.230 --> 02:02:13.063
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

4188
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Combining two fucking silly movies.</v>

4189
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:16.630
<v Speaker 2>One of them takes place in the future.</v>

4190
02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

4191
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Why don't it takes place now?</v>

4192
02:02:18.591 --> 02:02:19.401
<v Speaker 2>One of it takes place,</v>

4193
02:02:19.401 --> 02:02:22.490
<v Speaker 2>like how fucking thousand years from now and these they're all bat.</v>

4194
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Come on right out of here.</v>

4195
02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:24.441
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4196
02:02:24.441 --> 02:02:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

4197
02:02:25.090 --> 02:02:27.950
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to have some sort of an alien vs Predator didn't have some sort</v>

4198
02:02:27.951 --> 02:02:30.230
<v Speaker 2>of an ancient aliens yes to it did it,</v>

4199
02:02:30.231 --> 02:02:30.460
<v Speaker 2>did</v>

4200
02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:30.851
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

4201
02:02:30.851 --> 02:02:31.684
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4202
02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:32.650
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4203
02:02:32.650 --> 02:02:37.650
<v Speaker 6>the predators were worshiped by the Maya and there,</v>

4204
02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:43.210
<v Speaker 6>there was this fight going on between the predators and to Maya or the aliens</v>

4205
02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.740
<v Speaker 6>ever since Mayan Times.</v>

4206
02:02:44.741 --> 02:02:47.020
<v Speaker 6>And the mines were in between.</v>

4207
02:02:47.021 --> 02:02:49.810
<v Speaker 6>And that's how they disappear because they all got eaten up and things like</v>

4208
02:02:49.811 --> 02:02:50.644
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

4209
02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.573
<v Speaker 6>So I mean,</v>

4210
02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:52.600
<v Speaker 6>interesting,</v>

4211
02:02:52.601 --> 02:02:53.440
<v Speaker 6>but a trip.</v>

4212
02:02:53.590 --> 02:02:54.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4213
02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:54.970
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

4214
02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:55.880
<v Speaker 6>what is the</v>

4215
02:02:56.110 --> 02:03:01.110
<v Speaker 2>best version a and you think in like science fiction of what alien life is going</v>

4216
02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:02.651
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

4217
02:03:02.651 --> 02:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it was for me atheists</v>

4218
02:03:04.530 --> 02:03:05.430
<v Speaker 6>most recently?</v>

4219
02:03:05.431 --> 02:03:06.210
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4220
02:03:06.210 --> 02:03:08.100
<v Speaker 6>But then you have to ask yourself,</v>

4221
02:03:08.130 --> 02:03:08.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4222
02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:10.020
<v Speaker 6>who created the engineers,</v>

4223
02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:12.540
<v Speaker 6>who engineered engineers and this is why,</v>

4224
02:03:12.541 --> 02:03:12.751
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4225
02:03:12.751 --> 02:03:13.501
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion,</v>

4226
02:03:13.501 --> 02:03:18.501
<v Speaker 6>you can never really lose your belief in some all encompassing force in the</v>

4227
02:03:18.841 --> 02:03:19.321
<v Speaker 6>universe,</v>

4228
02:03:19.321 --> 02:03:20.820
<v Speaker 6>which I referred to as God.</v>

4229
02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:21.840
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4230
02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:22.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4231
02:03:22.410 --> 02:03:24.390
<v Speaker 6>or it was actually the vice vice versa.</v>

4232
02:03:24.810 --> 02:03:25.440
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4233
02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4234
02:03:26.010 --> 02:03:29.550
<v Speaker 6>but other science fiction movies that portray did wonderfully was,</v>

4235
02:03:29.551 --> 02:03:29.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4236
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:33.060
<v Speaker 6>the first total recall or star gate,</v>

4237
02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:33.411
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4238
02:03:33.411 --> 02:03:35.340
<v Speaker 6>the original theatrical release,</v>

4239
02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:36.300
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4240
02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:37.500
<v Speaker 6>mission to Mars.</v>

4241
02:03:37.770 --> 02:03:40.050
<v Speaker 6>All those movies were wonderful,</v>

4242
02:03:40.051 --> 02:03:45.051
<v Speaker 6>ancient alien type movies that describe the ancient alien theory very nicely,</v>

4243
02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:47.460
<v Speaker 6>not necessarily to the,</v>

4244
02:03:47.490 --> 02:03:48.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4245
02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:49.350
<v Speaker 6>in Star Gates case,</v>

4246
02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:49.861
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4247
02:03:49.861 --> 02:03:51.090
<v Speaker 6>accurately in my opinion,</v>

4248
02:03:51.091 --> 02:03:53.100
<v Speaker 6>because I don't think we were ever a slave species,</v>

4249
02:03:53.101 --> 02:03:53.701
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

4250
02:03:53.701 --> 02:03:58.140
<v Speaker 6>as so many other ancient alien theorists a subscribe to that decision on as</v>

4251
02:03:58.141 --> 02:03:58.381
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

4252
02:03:58.381 --> 02:03:58.650
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4253
02:03:58.650 --> 02:03:59.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4254
02:03:59.010 --> 02:03:59.251
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4255
02:03:59.251 --> 02:03:59.940
<v Speaker 6>And that'll always,</v>

4256
02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:00.541
<v Speaker 6>and he knows his,</v>

4257
02:04:00.541 --> 02:04:03.600
<v Speaker 6>I told him this when he was still alive that I actually disagreed with him.</v>

4258
02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Speaker 6>Daniel,</v>

4259
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:05.430
<v Speaker 6>let's agree with [inaudible] of course.</v>

4260
02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:07.800
<v Speaker 6>But the thing is it doesn't matter very cocky.</v>

4261
02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:09.900
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter because in the end,</v>

4262
02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:15.140
<v Speaker 6>the theory itself that we were visited remains the same whether we are a slave</v>

4263
02:04:15.331 --> 02:04:16.230
<v Speaker 6>species or not.</v>

4264
02:04:16.231 --> 02:04:17.880
<v Speaker 6>And I chose to think that we're not.</v>

4265
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:21.210
<v Speaker 6>Why do you choose irrelevant that why do you make that distinction?</v>

4266
02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:26.420
<v Speaker 6>Because he proposed that we were created as worker bees to mine gold mine gold</v>

4267
02:04:27.061 --> 02:04:31.330
<v Speaker 6>for the Anunnaki who needed gold for their atmosphere on their home planet named</v>

4268
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Nibiru meets you cock who has proposed or calculated that,</v>

4269
02:04:36.241 --> 02:04:36.810
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4270
02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:40.050
<v Speaker 6>there is the same amount of gold on any,</v>

4271
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:41.130
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4272
02:04:41.130 --> 02:04:43.050
<v Speaker 6>body found in the universe.</v>

4273
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:47.280
<v Speaker 6>So to suggest that they had to come specifically here to find gold,</v>

4274
02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:49.680
<v Speaker 6>logically speaking doesn't make much sense</v>

4275
02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:51.710
<v Speaker 2>saying that gold exists on Saturn.</v>

4276
02:04:51.711 --> 02:04:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Gold exists on Neptune.</v>

4277
02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.710
<v Speaker 6>Every single planetary body in all have the same amount of gold.</v>

4278
02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:57.130
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4279
02:04:57.130 --> 02:04:59.080
<v Speaker 6>Because it all expanded from the Big Bang.</v>

4280
02:04:59.081 --> 02:05:00.760
<v Speaker 6>It all was distributed evenly.</v>

4281
02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:01.960
<v Speaker 6>What about gas plants?</v>

4282
02:05:02.110 --> 02:05:02.943
<v Speaker 6>Gas?</v>

4283
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:03.610
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4284
02:05:03.610 --> 02:05:05.440
<v Speaker 6>you would have to ask Kako for this,</v>

4285
02:05:05.441 --> 02:05:10.060
<v Speaker 6>but the whole idea that solid objects contain the same amount of gold,</v>

4286
02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:12.190
<v Speaker 6>what he proposed that,</v>

4287
02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:12.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4288
02:05:12.701 --> 02:05:16.420
<v Speaker 6>aliens wouldn't have to come here if they wanted to mine gold.</v>

4289
02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4290
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's both.</v>

4291
02:05:20.210 --> 02:05:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they came here to engineer people,</v>

4292
02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but they also need gold.</v>

4293
02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:26.990
<v Speaker 2>So they engineered people to make gold.</v>

4294
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.950
<v Speaker 2>But it's both.</v>

4295
02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not just,</v>

4296
02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:29.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

4297
02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:29.720
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

4298
02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:30.920
<v Speaker 2>a dual project,</v>

4299
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Sean.</v>

4300
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Just an evolutionary.</v>

4301
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4302
02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:32.901
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4303
02:05:32.901 --> 02:05:33.190
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

4304
02:05:33.190 --> 02:05:34.120
<v Speaker 6>that's an interesting,</v>

4305
02:05:34.121 --> 02:05:34.331
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4306
02:05:34.331 --> 02:05:34.750
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4307
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:35.111
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4308
02:05:35.111 --> 02:05:36.430
<v Speaker 6>approach to looking at it.</v>

4309
02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:37.361
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>

4310
02:05:37.361 --> 02:05:38.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4311
02:05:38.170 --> 02:05:39.640
<v Speaker 6>the whole slave species thing,</v>

4312
02:05:39.641 --> 02:05:44.641
<v Speaker 6>it feeds into this current belief that we are beholden to someone else.</v>

4313
02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:48.040
<v Speaker 6>That we are not in control of our lives,</v>

4314
02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:53.020
<v Speaker 6>that we and our governments are ruled by aliens and that there's Reptilians and</v>

4315
02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.990
<v Speaker 6>all that bullshit that,</v>

4316
02:05:55.991 --> 02:05:56.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4317
02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:56.621
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4318
02:05:56.621 --> 02:06:01.300
<v Speaker 6>people really think that they are no longer in charge of their own lives.</v>

4319
02:06:01.301 --> 02:06:02.710
<v Speaker 6>That everything is,</v>

4320
02:06:02.890 --> 02:06:03.401
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4321
02:06:03.401 --> 02:06:03.761
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

4322
02:06:03.761 --> 02:06:07.030
<v Speaker 6>a planned and the overlooked by our alien overlord.</v>

4323
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:08.440
<v Speaker 6>And that to me,</v>

4324
02:06:09.190 --> 02:06:10.023
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4325
02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 6>even to a guy like me that is too fucking far out and come on,</v>

4326
02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:17.950
<v Speaker 6>just go back,</v>

4327
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:19.300
<v Speaker 6>come back to reality.</v>

4328
02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:23.860
<v Speaker 6>Put your feet on the ground and trying to differentiate between what's actually</v>

4329
02:06:23.861 --> 02:06:25.990
<v Speaker 6>feasible and something that's just,</v>

4330
02:06:25.991 --> 02:06:26.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4331
02:06:26.350 --> 02:06:27.640
<v Speaker 6>the sciences are you</v>

4332
02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:29.590
<v Speaker 2>and I part ways cause I think it is feasible.</v>

4333
02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at us and what we do to dolphins,</v>

4334
02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:34.150
<v Speaker 2>we forced them to do tricks for fish.</v>

4335
02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.470
<v Speaker 2>What we do to kill a whale.</v>

4336
02:06:35.471 --> 02:06:35.860
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

4337
02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:37.630
<v Speaker 2>which we know are intelligent creatures,</v>

4338
02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:37.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4339
02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Just can't understand what they're saying.</v>

4340
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:42.400
<v Speaker 2>They're intelligent enough to understand voice commands so they understand when</v>

4341
02:06:42.401 --> 02:06:45.280
<v Speaker 2>we want specific things and they do them by voice command.</v>

4342
02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:48.060
<v Speaker 2>And yet we don't understand what the fuck they're saying.</v>

4343
02:06:49.930 --> 02:06:50.351
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

4344
02:06:50.351 --> 02:06:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Walked down.</v>

4345
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Many people or scientists have been trying now ever since we were able to record</v>

4346
02:06:54.821 --> 02:06:55.150
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

4347
02:06:55.150 --> 02:06:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4348
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.901
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

4349
02:06:55.901 --> 02:06:59.110
<v Speaker 2>but the point is we know they're intelligent life forms and we slave him,</v>

4350
02:06:59.290 --> 02:07:00.123
<v Speaker 2>we enslave them.</v>

4351
02:07:00.250 --> 02:07:01.930
<v Speaker 2>We absolutely in slave dolphins,</v>

4352
02:07:01.931 --> 02:07:03.520
<v Speaker 2>we absolutely in slave killer whales,</v>

4353
02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>we know they're intelligent and we just assume that because they can't create</v>

4354
02:07:06.491 --> 02:07:09.520
<v Speaker 2>culture cause they can't alter their environment because they don't have thumbs.</v>

4355
02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.550
<v Speaker 2>We know they have language complex language.</v>

4356
02:07:12.551 --> 02:07:15.730
<v Speaker 2>So we know that unlike any other animal on the earth,</v>

4357
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.020
<v Speaker 2>besides humans,</v>

4358
02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:20.590
<v Speaker 2>that they are actually communicating with very specific words.</v>

4359
02:07:20.591 --> 02:07:21.011
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

4360
02:07:21.011 --> 02:07:24.280
<v Speaker 2>they have dialects and a very complex language that we can't decipher.</v>

4361
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:27.610
<v Speaker 2>We know like monkeys have like certain things that this means the cat.</v>

4362
02:07:27.611 --> 02:07:27.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4363
02:07:27.821 --> 02:07:28.360
<v Speaker 2>this is like the,</v>

4364
02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:28.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4365
02:07:28.691 --> 02:07:29.830
<v Speaker 2>they communicate with each other.</v>

4366
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Just very rudimentary and crude.</v>

4367
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:32.583
<v Speaker 2>Not like dolphins.</v>

4368
02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Dolphins have a complicated language as do whales,</v>

4369
02:07:35.590 --> 02:07:36.610
<v Speaker 2>but yet look what we do to them,</v>

4370
02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4371
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Put Him in a fucking cage.</v>

4372
02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4373
02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I think the captivity of animals except for preservation is barbaric.</v>

4374
02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:45.401
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

4375
02:07:45.401 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's done and it's done by every single animal on this planet that has a</v>

4376
02:07:49.991 --> 02:07:51.400
<v Speaker 2>power over another pow,</v>

4377
02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:51.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4378
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.150
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

4379
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:55.180
<v Speaker 2>It exploited and it seems to be a pattern in the universe.</v>

4380
02:07:55.181 --> 02:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be.</v>

4381
02:07:55.810 --> 02:07:57.610
<v Speaker 2>If you look at biological life,</v>

4382
02:07:57.611 --> 02:07:59.230
<v Speaker 2>completely objective on this planet,</v>

4383
02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:03.040
<v Speaker 2>everything that's more intelligent or more powerful fucks up everything that's</v>

4384
02:08:03.041 --> 02:08:03.520
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

4385
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's just the way it is.</v>

4386
02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Monkeys are very intelligent little things and chimps eat them,</v>

4387
02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.830
<v Speaker 2>they grab them and they ripped them apart and they eat them while they're alive.</v>

4388
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:12.693
<v Speaker 2>And we know that.</v>

4389
02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>And we know that we do crazy shit to monkeys.</v>

4390
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:16.090
<v Speaker 2>We do experiments on them,</v>

4391
02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:19.510
<v Speaker 2>we take chimps and we put them in laboratories and we put lipstick on him and</v>

4392
02:08:19.511 --> 02:08:19.781
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

4393
02:08:19.781 --> 02:08:20.614
<v Speaker 2>See if they die.</v>

4394
02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:21.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4395
02:08:21.131 --> 02:08:21.964
<v Speaker 2>that's what we do.</v>

4396
02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:23.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do.</v>

4397
02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:26.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if you look at that pattern,</v>

4398
02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.140
<v Speaker 2>our pattern of enslaving dolphins and killer whales,</v>

4399
02:08:29.141 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>because we have the ability to alter environment that they don't have,</v>

4400
02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:33.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4401
02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:34.330
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>

4402
02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I would say why wouldn't something much more intelligent than a human being</v>

4403
02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:41.890
<v Speaker 2>that's been around for a million years.</v>

4404
02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:45.700
<v Speaker 2>That's completely unimpressed with some fucking caveman or some,</v>

4405
02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4406
02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Australia [inaudible] some stupid fuck out there running around picking</v>

4407
02:08:50.171 --> 02:08:50.951
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms off a cow.</v>

4408
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

4409
02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:56.550
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't we enslave them if we is some super alien forced,</v>

4410
02:08:56.591 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a billion years more advanced than us.</v>

4411
02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Why we're saying if we do it to everything that's on this planet,</v>

4412
02:09:02.050 --> 02:09:02.740
<v Speaker 2>why would you,</v>

4413
02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:07.510
<v Speaker 2>we have this weird thing of assuming that things are altruistic,</v>

4414
02:09:07.570 --> 02:09:11.530
<v Speaker 2>that the universe is going to be more advanced morally than we are,</v>

4415
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:15.730
<v Speaker 2>but we show zero sign personal evolution.</v>

4416
02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:16.241
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

4417
02:09:16.241 --> 02:09:21.241
<v Speaker 2>I think that as society who is able to travel between the stars has at least</v>

4418
02:09:23.081 --> 02:09:28.081
<v Speaker 2>reached such a level of awareness</v>

4419
02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:32.350
<v Speaker 6>that they have at least stopped killing each other on their own home planet.</v>

4420
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:35.080
<v Speaker 6>Because I agree with you that there is good and evil out there.</v>

4421
02:09:35.110 --> 02:09:39.070
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you that there might be civilizations out there from different</v>

4422
02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:40.600
<v Speaker 6>plans of warring with each other,</v>

4423
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.960
<v Speaker 6>but I think that until you can reach that level that you have to come to the</v>

4424
02:09:46.451 --> 02:09:50.830
<v Speaker 6>understanding that we have to clean up our house first.</v>

4425
02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.050
<v Speaker 6>So that because,</v>

4426
02:09:52.090 --> 02:09:57.010
<v Speaker 6>because I think that you see the whole warring thing and you know,</v>

4427
02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:58.383
<v Speaker 6>fighting,</v>

4428
02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:02.530
<v Speaker 6>creating wars over religion and oil and all those different things in the end,</v>

4429
02:10:02.531 --> 02:10:06.100
<v Speaker 6>but we have to understand is that we are on this planet together and once we</v>

4430
02:10:06.101 --> 02:10:07.300
<v Speaker 6>realize that,</v>

4431
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:11.800
<v Speaker 6>I think that is when we will make contact and that is when we can band together</v>

4432
02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 6>and potentially fight and threat if there is one.</v>

4433
02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:16.541
<v Speaker 6>But like I said,</v>

4434
02:10:16.541 --> 02:10:18.310
<v Speaker 6>there's good and evil out there.</v>

4435
02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:23.460
<v Speaker 6>So the fact that we've been around until 2012 after having gone through two</v>

4436
02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:28.720
<v Speaker 6>genetic bottleneck situations on planet earth with the human race,</v>

4437
02:10:29.170 --> 02:10:34.170
<v Speaker 6>I think we're in pretty good shape of not being annihilated by whoever</v>

4438
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:38.660
<v Speaker 7>some are proposing will annihilate us on the 21st of December,</v>

4439
02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:39.950
<v Speaker 7>2012 which is total nonsense.</v>

4440
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:43.370
<v Speaker 7>I think if you look at our state of existence on this earth,</v>

4441
02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:44.960
<v Speaker 7>if you look at Kim Kardashian,</v>

4442
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:48.590
<v Speaker 7>if you look at Obama and uh,</v>

4443
02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:49.370
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4444
02:10:49.370 --> 02:10:53.720
<v Speaker 7>Mubarak in Egypt and you look at the chaos in the world and you look at us</v>

4445
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:58.930
<v Speaker 7>pulling the oil out of the ground and if you look at us just polluting the ocean</v>

4446
02:10:59.421 --> 02:11:00.620
<v Speaker 7>at pulling the resources out,</v>

4447
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:05.621
<v Speaker 7>we act like a prison colony that doesn't have a fucking warden.</v>

4448
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:08.780
<v Speaker 7>We're just super duper duper complicated.</v>

4449
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:09.291
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>

4450
02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:14.030
<v Speaker 7>our whole culture acts like someone who got to this place,</v>

4451
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.840
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4452
02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:16.980
<v Speaker 7>accidentally or was,</v>

4453
02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:22.100
<v Speaker 7>was helped by whether it's humans that are super advanced or aliens or,</v>

4454
02:11:23.791 --> 02:11:24.980
<v Speaker 7>or some sort of a thing.</v>

4455
02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:26.570
<v Speaker 7>It looks like what a prison.</v>

4456
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:27.740
<v Speaker 7>You've got to go soon we go.</v>

4457
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:31.010
<v Speaker 7>It looks like what you would expect if a prison was overrun,</v>

4458
02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:31.581
<v Speaker 7>I mean were,</v>

4459
02:11:31.581 --> 02:11:36.080
<v Speaker 7>were so irresponsible and how we pollute the earth so irresponsible in how we</v>

4460
02:11:36.081 --> 02:11:37.970
<v Speaker 7>utilize this incredible technology.</v>

4461
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:38.211
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

4462
02:11:38.211 --> 02:11:39.860
<v Speaker 7>but then there are religions.</v>

4463
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:40.560
<v Speaker 7>We've slaves,</v>

4464
02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.090
<v Speaker 7>nutty.</v>

4465
02:11:41.090 --> 02:11:42.920
<v Speaker 7>But then there are religions that propose,</v>

4466
02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:43.820
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

4467
02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:46.820
<v Speaker 7>it's all right because when Jesus comes back,</v>

4468
02:11:46.821 --> 02:11:47.270
<v Speaker 7>he will,</v>

4469
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:52.270
<v Speaker 7>he will pick us up in a spaceship and we will be brought to new earth now ha.</v>

4470
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.320
<v Speaker 7>And in that is the plant that we should keep.</v>

4471
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:55.370
<v Speaker 7>It should take care of.</v>

4472
02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.260
<v Speaker 7>Now what an irresponsible teaching or proposition is that,</v>

4473
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:01.100
<v Speaker 7>oh yeah,</v>

4474
02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:03.470
<v Speaker 7>let this mother earth go to fucking shit.</v>

4475
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:04.400
<v Speaker 7>But who cares?</v>

4476
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.310
<v Speaker 7>Because we will be picked up and brought to another planet.</v>

4477
02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 7>Are you fucking shitting me?</v>

4478
02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:11.030
<v Speaker 7>That is no longer religion,</v>

4479
02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 7>but that is the height of human arrogance and insanity.</v>

4480
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:16.700
<v Speaker 7>That is a crazy argument as well.</v>

4481
02:12:16.701 --> 02:12:18.290
<v Speaker 7>And we were crazy a idea as well,</v>

4482
02:12:18.291 --> 02:12:22.220
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that we were in fact</v>

4483
02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.870
<v Speaker 7>created two n and engineered to work for these super intelligent beings.</v>

4484
02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:27.400
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4485
02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:27.740
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4486
02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:29.540
<v Speaker 7>I agree with you that it's very possible.</v>

4487
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:29.751
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4488
02:12:29.751 --> 02:12:31.670
<v Speaker 7>I mean of course it's possible.</v>

4489
02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:32.510
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>

4490
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:35.780
<v Speaker 7>I really do not have the answers.</v>

4491
02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:38.720
<v Speaker 7>But if you think about what I'm saying is if you think about how we exploit</v>

4492
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:40.130
<v Speaker 7>everything else below us,</v>

4493
02:12:40.190 --> 02:12:42.740
<v Speaker 7>we're assuming that somewhere up the ladder that stops.</v>

4494
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:45.710
<v Speaker 7>But in the life that we see my proposition,</v>

4495
02:12:45.711 --> 02:12:46.050
<v Speaker 7>yes,</v>

4496
02:12:46.050 --> 02:12:47.690
<v Speaker 7>but you look at the life that we see,</v>

4497
02:12:47.691 --> 02:12:50.570
<v Speaker 7>the intelligent life that we see despite pita and despite,</v>

4498
02:12:50.571 --> 02:12:51.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

4499
02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:53.960
<v Speaker 7>people that are trying to propagate piece.</v>

4500
02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:55.100
<v Speaker 7>It's not existing,</v>

4501
02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.500
<v Speaker 7>but that's just more more today than ever before.</v>

4502
02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:02.620
<v Speaker 7>But there is at the same time a paradigm shift happening that we're experiencing</v>

4503
02:13:02.751 --> 02:13:03.860
<v Speaker 7>because I agree,</v>

4504
02:13:03.861 --> 02:13:07.760
<v Speaker 7>but there's no lines where people are trying to break free the Dawes because</v>

4505
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:08.450
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

4506
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:09.070
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

4507
02:13:09.070 --> 02:13:13.100
<v Speaker 7>it's fluctuating that the time of the dolphins I think will come,</v>

4508
02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 7>especially since every day more and more people are embracing vegetarianism and</v>

4509
02:13:18.711 --> 02:13:21.380
<v Speaker 7>even veganism that's frozen closes.</v>

4510
02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:23.510
<v Speaker 7>It's delicious and cows are stupid.</v>

4511
02:13:23.511 --> 02:13:24.320
<v Speaker 7>And that's,</v>

4512
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:24.620
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

4513
02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:24.941
<v Speaker 7>that's his.</v>

4514
02:13:24.941 --> 02:13:29.360
<v Speaker 7>But it's a dumb thing is a paradigm shift that has never happened before and</v>

4515
02:13:29.361 --> 02:13:30.350
<v Speaker 7>it's happening fast.</v>

4516
02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:30.711
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

4517
02:13:30.711 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 7>But isn't the argument that that's because</v>

4518
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 2>of surplus and because people have the first world option of being a vegetarian,</v>

4519
02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:37.381
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

4520
02:13:37.381 --> 02:13:37.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4521
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:38.190
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4522
02:13:38.190 --> 02:13:41.490
<v Speaker 2>in most cultures it's about staying alive and you need protein.</v>

4523
02:13:41.491 --> 02:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>And if the only food availables fish,</v>

4524
02:13:43.111 --> 02:13:43.944
<v Speaker 2>you're eating fish.</v>

4525
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:44.910
<v Speaker 2>If cows are available,</v>

4526
02:13:44.911 --> 02:13:45.744
<v Speaker 2>you're eating cows.</v>

4527
02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>And as our civilization,</v>

4528
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:47.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4529
02:13:47.731 --> 02:13:50.010
<v Speaker 2>becomes more and more complex than we have these uh,</v>

4530
02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.180
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

4531
02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:53.970
<v Speaker 2>But I see what you're saying.</v>

4532
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:54.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4533
02:13:54.301 --> 02:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I see that I would love it if that was true.</v>

4534
02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:59.650
<v Speaker 2>If everything eventually got to a point where you,</v>

4535
02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

4536
02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:04.310
<v Speaker 2>these super intelligent being so far advanced from us would look at us and go,</v>

4537
02:14:04.330 --> 02:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4538
02:14:04.890 --> 02:14:05.670
<v Speaker 2>you guys are,</v>

4539
02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:06.570
<v Speaker 2>you guys are pretty cool.</v>

4540
02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:07.620
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to fuck with you.</v>

4541
02:14:07.621 --> 02:14:08.221
<v Speaker 2>And when we come here,</v>

4542
02:14:08.221 --> 02:14:08.821
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to make,</v>

4543
02:14:08.821 --> 02:14:11.610
<v Speaker 2>you were going to let you play with house and we're not going to,</v>

4544
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:14.370
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to exploit you the way you do.</v>

4545
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.370
<v Speaker 2>And every other form of life does on this planet.</v>

4546
02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one thing that Promethean has got that I thought was pretty</v>

4547
02:14:22.261 --> 02:14:26.580
<v Speaker 2>probably dead on the disdain that the engineers would have for humans after what</v>

4548
02:14:26.581 --> 02:14:27.450
<v Speaker 2>happened and how are we do,</v>

4549
02:14:27.451 --> 02:14:30.720
<v Speaker 2>how we turned out the same way we would if we went to the fucking jungle.</v>

4550
02:14:30.721 --> 02:14:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And there was a tribe of chimps that had created electricity and they were</v>

4551
02:14:34.621 --> 02:14:36.030
<v Speaker 2>shooting lightning bolts at each other.</v>

4552
02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:36.691
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be like,</v>

4553
02:14:36.691 --> 02:14:37.051
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

4554
02:14:37.051 --> 02:14:38.760
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

4555
02:14:38.890 --> 02:14:42.390
<v Speaker 2>We would completely take it away from them and if we were going to change them</v>

4556
02:14:42.391 --> 02:14:43.224
<v Speaker 2>and fix them,</v>

4557
02:14:43.230 --> 02:14:44.150
<v Speaker 2>we would have no problem.</v>

4558
02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:44.641
<v Speaker 2>Hence,</v>

4559
02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:48.180
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have stories of these UFOS disabling nuclear plants.</v>

4560
02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Hence that's why we haven't tried it and the apes.</v>

4561
02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:53.280
<v Speaker 2>But we take a champion and make it super intelligent and it gets fucking really</v>
