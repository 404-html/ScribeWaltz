[inaudible] that's,

It's the do mushroom store.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
Say Good tour.
It's a good name.
It's a good message.
It's a,
it's a,

10
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.360
it's a good thing you're doing like doing the Lord's work,

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.330
trying to get the word out,
but the Lord's product.
You're doing the Lord's work.

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.670
Does anyone has ever been doing the Lord's work?

13
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:55.410
It's the man who invented trim fast.
How many people,

14
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.530
by the way,
worldwide participate in shrimp fest?
Every year?

15
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:03.360
I heard it was over a billion.
Is that true?
Mr Shapiro?
I,

16
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.350
that was the last stats I saw or over a billion.
Over a billion.
What's really,

17
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:10.350
we're doing fairly well in that regard.
It's like how many billions are,

18
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.480
they're definitely,
that's not most of them,
but we're getting there.

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.410
This 7 billion people and out of the 7 billion people on earth,

20
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.320
1 billion every year participation through assessed,

21
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.970
you know this year it's August 29th 30th and 31st he's a really,
yeah.

22
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.040
You so you give it three days.
Yeah.

23
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.240
What's ideally for the average shroom or how many,

24
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:33.920
how many trips did they do in those three days?
Oh,
one just one day.

25
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.810
When it's time to do it?
Yeah.
Oh,
just one.
Only one.
Yeah.

26
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.660
You don't like to do like multiple on a weekend.
I have done that this last year.

27
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:45.160
Invest.
We just kept taking them three days just in cabin.
Just fucking going.

28
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.271
Yeah.

29
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.240
We're worrying about like being that dude from pink Floyd that never comes back.

30
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.960
No.
I would stop worrying about that.
You stopped worrying.

31
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.040
There's only like barely any guys I've ever seen like that.
Barely any,
yeah.

32
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.490
I don't know if it's from that or just mild schizophrenia.
There's always that,

33
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:00.324
right?
Yeah.

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.840
The the real problem is like what if you have mental illness plus psychedelics?

35
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.660
If you,
if you're just a totally normal person,

36
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.240
you have normal balance levels of whatever hormones your head.

37
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.560
But then that's the only thing if you're prone to prone to that schizophrenia,

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.360
that's the only time I'd be like them don't,
if you haven't,

39
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.220
your family maybe don't.
Yeah,
I would say if reality is at all slippery,
Huh?

40
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.600
Just hold off on that.
You're barely hold bonds.

41
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.820
I can't really get yourself a good foundation.

42
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.120
But then there's the other problems.

43
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
If you take a lot of the drugs that people take,

44
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.150
like even antidepressants,

45
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.210
you're not supposed to ever take mushrooms when you taking notes.
Not True.

46
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.060
There's different kinds of enterprise.
Ask Your doctor.
I asked Mike,

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.090
how's your doctor?
I asked mine,

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.150
Ari Shaffir here for you.

49
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.570
Tell them what you're doing and then they'll help you with like medically

50
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:55.870
through that.
Okay.
So I asked him about,
hey,
I heard this thing about,
well,
Moa,

51
00:02:55.871 --> 00:03:00.160
I inhibitors [inaudible] an Ssri inhibitors.
So Mike,
uh,

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.260
her mushrooms counteract badly with those and he goes,

53
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.480
and I don't know which one's which,
but he goes,
no,
that's that one.

54
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.080
You're taking this type of uh,
anti depression medication.
Oh.

55
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.100
So it wouldn't interfere at all.
Okay.

56
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.930
So you really should ask your doctor and find out whether or not it's an issue.

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.950
Yeah.
So with you lose zero issue at all?
Yeah.
He goes,
no,
no,
no.
That's fair.

58
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.530
It's like that.

59
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.860
But the minute somebody didn't tell him not to protect antibiotics and you had

60
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:22.660
to say,
we have to say why and they go,

61
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.600
because if it's that the antibiotics won't work anymore,
then I won't drink.

62
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.500
But if it's just as going to make drinking awesome,
then I'm going to drink.
Well,

63
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.960
I've heard people that have talking about,
um,

64
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.050
taking meor I eh Meo wise mano aiming oxidase inhibitors and taking those,

65
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.660
uh,
with anything like anything dimethyltryptamine based,

66
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.450
whether it's a real ask or DMT or anything along those lines.

67
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.580
And it becomes like really potent to the point where it dangerously potent.

68
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.050
Oh really?
Yeah.
I think Chemical Maoi m I'm saying it fucked up.

69
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.980
M a o i's motto aiming oxidase inhibitors,

70
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.630
like the pharmaceutical versions of it are extremely strong.

71
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.200
The really strong and you're not supposed to take anything DMT based with them

72
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.950
because that's the whole,

73
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.220
the whole basis of Iowasca is I'm a natural Maoi inhibitor,

74
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.160
which is called harming mixed in with the leaves that have the DMT.

75
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.620
That's why you,
you can take it in through drinking it.

76
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.040
They said some of those things that flood your brains with like,

77
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.590
it's almost like the inhibitors shut off so it floods your brains,

78
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:34.090
you get super happy like ecstasy or some things like that and then that all

79
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:35.290
drops out and then you're like,

80
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.291
oh I need your body sort of stopped producing depletion and shit like that.

81
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.680
Yeah,
there will you expand.

82
00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:47.681
I mean Tim Ferriss has this statement or this saying it was a really good saying

83
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.940
is that there are no biological free lunches,
you know,

84
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:55.750
and that everything has a price.
You drink coffee,

85
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.820
then you crash,
you know,
take speed.
Then you come down,
you know,

86
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:02.710
you drink alcohol,
you feel great,

87
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.270
then you're hung over in order to achieve these hyper natural states.

88
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.410
There's some sort of consequence is vacuum vacuums can't exist,
right?
Yeah.

89
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.660
There's like there's a pull and a push and there's like,

90
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:14.680
there's something going on.

91
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.620
Every time you do something that fucks with your consciousness.

92
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.330
It's just the idea is finding like what does the least amount of damage and the

93
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:26.890
most amount of benefit.
Yeah.
Fun.
Yeah,
exactly.

94
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.980
Like I'm gonna get fucked up.
What's it going to be on?
Yeah.
I like go math,

95
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:33.310
which I pull it back.
Well,
he's a lot of people that are like,

96
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.100
I am not going through this fucking thing.
So over.
Oh No.

97
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.870
Why would you not doing it?
Not Live with her at all times doing it.

98
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.190
Thank you.
You have met my mother and father in law.

99
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.190
No thank you.
I will be fucked up for this.

100
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.450
This is not a ride that you should take.
Seriously.
This is a ride.

101
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.940
You should be sober only when necessary.

102
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.310
Only when life are you doing surgery?

103
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.300
<v 3>Yeah,
you should be sober.
Um,
are you going to Disneyland?
Why are you sober?</v>

104
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.520
Why Sony?
You doing what's wrong with you?

105
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.330
Somehow or another make a terrible decision when you're on the teapot.
I went,

106
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.930
yeah,
I'll be spending the teacups.

107
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.990
Those things where you spin around and they don't serve alcohol at Disneyland.

108
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.860
Huh?
Well they have alcohol at um,

109
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.610
California adventure and they had the,
the outside place with all the bars.

110
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.980
Yeah.
Which is like downtown Disney.
You have alcohol.
There were restaurants.

111
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.480
It's not like Mormon alcohol or it's like a 2% of sip peer.

112
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.870
Technically alcohol.
It's real alcohol.
They have real alcohol,

113
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.910
but I'm inside Disneyland is apparently only one place where you can get alcohol

114
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:41.800
and it's this place.

115
00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:46.460
It's above pirates of the Caribbean and you have to pay like some insane amount

116
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:49.400
of like yearly money.
Thrilled to go there.
Yeah.

117
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.690
You have to spend a shit load of money.

118
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:53.930
It costs like 25 granted joinders lessons.
We have a member.
Yeah.

119
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:56.570
What does that more than than that?
What does that shit called?

120
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.630
Club 33 or something like that.
Yeah,
something along those lines.

121
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.090
It's like CEOs of companies.
Yeah.

122
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.080
Dice have club 43 is his basement or something.

123
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.040
He wouldn't tell anybody why you called her that.
Maybe that's what it is.

124
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.860
They didn't.
I finally figured it out.
Hmm.
I don't remember.

125
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.890
You got to know what it is.
18 Ma.
Oh,

126
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.940
like a big fat fuck Jang Nash.
Oh,

127
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.860
there.
You know what I'm talking about?

128
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.490
It's somebody you're Diaz impression is one of the best around and we,

129
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.260
I forgot about,
we used to have Diaz off.
I like the Brita Improv.

130
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:34.510
These fucking so cal Mexican comics stuff.

131
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.320
They have great the has and you're like,
let's do it.
Let's do it.

132
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.880
At the end of your headliner said,
do you remember that can beat me.
He beat me.

133
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.150
He yes was better.
He had,
his mannerisms were awesome.

134
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:48.500
Silent Bob got me.
He got me.
My voice might have been a little bit better.

135
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.940
A little bit more exact.

136
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.210
He also did the hand thing where it was like this weird like,
well he was also,

137
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.810
yeah,
he was just in the groove.
Nailed it.
He nailed it.
The cocaine,
the cocaine.

138
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.580
Next stop.
I need to just like doing that open shut up and shot.
Next up.
What?

139
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.440
Well,

This guy that's,
that's the Joey Dee,

140
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.200
his mannerisms.
He had the mannerisms down.
I had a voice.

141
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.150
My voice was probably a little bit better than his,

142
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.280
but he overwhelmed me with his mannerisms.

143
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.310
He swore he took the title.
What am I going to say?
Yeah,
I forgot who want,

144
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.100
who would?
Yeah,
he'd beat me.
I gave it to him.
I said he won.
I gave it up.
I said,

145
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:31.610
that's better.
This is better.
Yeah.
You know stuff he says though,

146
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.430
that sounds like stuff.
He would say,
I guess I,
I did too.
Well,

147
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.650
so maybe it's just he couldn't beat him up.

148
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.720
He deserves to wait.
I forgot about that Joey.

149
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.550
He's the greatest guy that's ever walked the face of the planet and these three

150
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:49.280
d glasses kind of tripping out a little like little,

151
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.630
you have a lot behind each show,
so it's little.
Yeah,

152
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.330
the lava lamp is fucking weird.
The reason why wearing these shirts are,

153
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.340
should fear has these three d t w the why worn these shirts.

154
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.870
Why we're wearing these goggles.
He's a blast.

155
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.760
He's fucking ridiculous.

156
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.680
Paper glasses were wearing already has these new t shirts and if you wear these

157
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:13.890
glasses,
these tee shirts look three dimensional.

158
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.310
It's weird that no one's ever figured out a way to make three d work without

159
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.600
glasses.
Oh yeah,
they have.
But you go to the movies,
you always have glasses.
Yeah.

160
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.910
Just make the fucking screen in a three d movie for all time.

161
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.520
Three d movie screen.
Yeah.
But even those three d screens,

162
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:30.360
you have to wear glasses.
Yeah,
no bullshit.
Like the Nintendo,

163
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.980
we live in a horrible logo.
Our lives are worth anything.

164
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.510
OPO and Nintendo three Ds is an example of a small screen that you don't need

165
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.440
glasses and they do have small monitors that are good as it used it.

166
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.130
Getting there.
Is it better?
Is it better than the game boy graphics?

167
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.560
It's just came away with three d

168
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.420
like when you go to see like top level three d like Avatar.

169
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.620
We'll start with the best when we talked through that way,

170
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.980
that one place in the valley,
like that opening scene,

171
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.170
what's it doing is floating around with her all and let 3-d floating around

172
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.040
space.
I remember when the coming out of their pods and he's floating.
Yeah.
Uh,

173
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.110
well it was like the greatest 3d of all time.
Yeah.
You're like,
wow.

174
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.090
And the island,
the floating islands were like

175
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.810
the floating island.
I forgot about that.
You can't do that without glasses.
Right?

176
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.630
Not to that point yet.
To that point,

177
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.800
I mean it's still kind of small screens and not as good.
Last I checked,

178
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.770
I said I'm an interesting to somebody even figured out how to do that.

179
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.910
How to do it.
Yes.
Separate the red and the blue.
Fuck.
Yeah.

180
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.300
He figured out how to make people look like they're floating in front of you.

181
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.370
Give this extra dimensional aspect.

182
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.670
I remember the olden days when they had those spaceship movie,
three days,

183
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.590
like when I was young teens,
like 1412 something like that.
I would,

184
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.480
the ships would come over here and you'd be like,
what the fuck?

185
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.050
It's a lean back to avoid it.
I want that three d none of that bullshit.

186
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.700
They didn't give you now avatar was great.
Everything else is garbage.

187
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.030
Could you imagine if life was three d?
It is.

188
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.880
It's not three d like that.
Not like that.
That's really like that.

189
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:16.200
That's three D in this really weird freaky way where like you see a car accident

190
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:18.240
a mile away and all of a sudden it's in your face.

191
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.960
It was like a couple of good three d movies that would,

192
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:24.840
that slow motion movie was good and three D uh,

193
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.940
the new judge Dredd or something since city?
No,
it was like super slow motion.

194
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:32.100
They gave people,
the drug they gave were giving out with slow Mo,

195
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.300
so they give to Sloan with a dump them off this fucking giant roof and they die

196
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:38.590
and like an hour and a half.
Oh God.

197
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.290
Paul Slow Mo and then Jackass Three d,
that was the other,
those Avatar.

198
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.350
Those are the only three movies that have ever like fuck ya three to here where

199
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.180
I have a tar was insane.

200
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.230
They were flying when they were on those dragons flying around and it was in

201
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:56.140
three d like God,
it was like your mouth is open.

202
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.610
Just God.
It's incredible.
It's glorious.

203
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.840
It's got does other good in three d I never saw Godzilla movies do five at the

204
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:06.430
beginning and three at the end.

205
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.800
That's all they do and they give be garbage up front.

206
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.250
We cycled this when you're done with it,
fuck you.
Fuck you.

207
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.310
I'm breaking it right in front of them.
They know though.
I swear I do now.

208
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.050
I'm like cut John lows.
No,
this isn't acceptable anymore.
This movie's bad.

209
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.250
You can't tell us it's three days.

210
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.700
We're going in and saying it's going to be like four 50 and then fucking
nothing.

211
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:26.980
Five at the beginning,
three at the end.
That's all.

212
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.080
They give you five at the beginning,

213
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.270
five minutes of the beginning of three d and then at the end,

214
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.240
so you go on your way out.
Those though,
some garbage at you.

215
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.260
I remember it's three days,

216
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.410
no three the whole way you forget it because you won't even,

217
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.270
not even like atmosphere three d like depth,
nothing.
It's stupid.

218
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.780
They're just robbing ya
later.

219
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:51.781
And with the canyons and the big electrical nuclear power supply,

220
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.070
there was a few moments with the three d get the fucking falling of cranes.

221
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.180
Godzilla tele.
Yeah.
The only problem with Godzilla was,

222
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.620
spoiler alert,
spoiler,

223
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.940
if you never see God's

224
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.680
cow off on the right,

225
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.530
it's a fucking Godzilla.
Shut the power off on your stereo.
One.

226
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:22.240
You can kind of swirl looked in Congress,
somebody.
Here's the spoiler alert.

227
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.140
Kink con loses in every movie,
every movie,
every movie.

228
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.430
He never fucking wish do a fight club type King Kong.

229
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:33.670
We're going just fucking starts dominant and gets right off the statue of

230
00:13:33.671 --> 00:13:36.960
whatever he's on the empire state building and just goes and fucking smashed

231
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.440
those underground to really think our puny bullets can penetrate the fucking

232
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:45.670
great Kong.
Did Gazelle ever fight King Kong?
While yeah,

233
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.040
but it doesn't make any sense.
Well,

234
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:51.400
they had to change the sizes the size yet until it was so much big.

235
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.630
King Kong was only 50 feet tall.
I've got till it was 500 feet tall.

236
00:13:55.631 --> 00:14:00.080
That's fucking retarded.
Yeah.
But I'm King Kong has black people strength.
So that

237
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.740
was the bigger,

238
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.370
you get a a big black guy,

239
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.840
black person.
He's a gorilla and that's a lizard.
Fuck you.

240
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.280
Oh my God.
I just,
I just became a social justice warrior.

241
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:21.100
I give it for the right of freedom.
I'm on the wrong side.

242
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:24.010
I realize being friends with you should fear I'm on the wrong side.

243
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:27.400
Black people's drink pink column.
That's not a person.

244
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.660
How about fucking to justify that he fought even in that fight.
Well,

245
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:35.920
because it was a fucking Japanese production didn't make any sense.

246
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:37.690
The King Kong didn't even look like King Kong.

247
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.200
If you had that King Kong and the real King Kong in a lineup be booed.

248
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.890
Really be able to distinguish between the two of them.
They'd be like,

249
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.450
that is not the guy that fucked me.
I'm just the guy on the right.

250
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.590
The little short dude,
I don't know that 500 foot tall dude,

251
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.980
what fuck is he?
He's 10 times bigger than that other dude.

252
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:56.510
I know how to swim across the ocean.

253
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.740
That guys way bigger than the guy know Zillow [inaudible] here with radiation or

254
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:05.000
anything.
No explanation whatsoever.

255
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.750
Just they want you to be stupid because it's 1962 or whatever the fuck it was

256
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:12.100
when they made that movie.
There was no thinking about it.
What do you,

257
00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:13.820
what do you,
I'm looking at a picture right now.

258
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:18.821
It's so hilarious of King Kong versus Godzilla because they cause King Kong

259
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:24.470
looks just like,
like just looks really,
it looks ridiculous.
They all,

260
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:28.250
I've watched him,
dude,
when I was a kid,
I fucking loved King Kong.

261
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.640
I love King Kong and my cousin Mike Glove Godzilla.

262
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.230
We even got into fisticuffs at one juncture away over was,

263
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.910
oh it was better Kong versus Godzilla.
Who would win?
Yeah,

264
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.140
that was before they had that movie or your [inaudible] were both six or

265
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:44.540
whatever the fuck we were five probably were five.

266
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.270
When we're arguing going knuckles up over who would win?

267
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.750
Got God versus taking children bottom over it.

268
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.810
We totally fought.
That's why,
you know,
I was always talking about children side.

269
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.600
I was always on guides.
That's interesting.
When I moved to New York,

270
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:03.260
I finally realized like any sort of racism,
like any fear based racism,

271
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.520
like I'm afraid of black people just became,
oh,
I'm just afraid of the youth.
Uh,

272
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.150
anyone young,
they're just rowdy and they pushy or they just shove,

273
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.590
they're more likely to shove and say something like settled down young man.

274
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.440
We were,
yeah,
we were talking about that in the previous podcast.

275
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.870
We were talking about the scariest thing my friend Eric,

276
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.340
they were crisp of sugar tree cues.
I think you met him before Eric.
Chris maybe.

277
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:28.680
What's the deal maker?
What city?
He lives in New Mexico.
Okay.
Um,

278
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.690
he said that teenage boys,
the scariest thing on earth do,

279
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.980
they don't know limits and they're getting strong,
you know,
like real cocky.

280
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:41.030
Just coming into their body is overwhelmed with like testosterone and Maria age

281
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.770
and a lot of their versions of the world are based on movies.
I'll fuck you up.

282
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.330
Come to me at that way.
I'll go,
I'll die for that.
Cause like really 17 year old,

283
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.410
I'm thinking,
well shit,
that makes you realize like,
oh,

284
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:59.390
you're just a child.
You're just a little boy who's like six feet tall.

285
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.670
You're this,
you're that.
Exactly.
They don't know.

286
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:03.890
At least 10 years old and you're really strong,

287
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.840
but you're out there running through the world like a big baby almost,
you know,

288
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.300
supervise baby.
Oh,
big strong,

289
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.230
unsupervised baby who's just learned and America's the best.

290
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.610
That's why fucking fight.
He was America's the best,
right America.

291
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.620
The one guy said it was I fucking off.

292
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.940
Fuck that bitch swallowed his chief health till learn like no.

293
00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:28.330
Well actually at a point that he's trying to make.
No,
fuck you.

294
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.600
You didn't even hear his point out the point.
Oh Man.

295
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.660
Yeah.
That's a,
that's the world we live in.
Arusha,
fear,
godly.

296
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.590
It's tough.
Tough to get it together.
So goddamn mad.
Race.

297
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.910
We're all deer with dealing with a,
uh,

298
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.850
a big spreadsheet of genetics that was sort of formulated back.
Boy Running.

299
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.210
Avoid them like barking doors.
Okay.
Okay.
Get us in people's DNA.
Ari.

300
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.600
We're trapped in some 10,000 filed sugar and rape and drug ourselves.

301
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.720
Cold Syrup bought.
Did you ever get a hold of the real nyquil?

302
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.080
No.
You never got ahold of real nyquil.
He never took it.

303
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.840
No Man.
Didn't really fuck you.
Oh Man.
I remember,

304
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.620
look,
when I was on a news radio,
like in the late nineties,

305
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.610
um,
no,
I had never done any drugs.
I didn't do anything.
We can't say no.

306
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.140
He says that and you're like,
guys,
but it's not the way to the fucking top.

307
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.630
I thought it made you lazy.
No bullshit.
But um,
but this was a,

308
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:37.290
this was told her do things.
You're like,
oh,
I was wrong.
Let's go the other way.

309
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.590
Cause I was wrong.
I see.

310
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.390
That's what I said about when I was still a virgin in college.
I'm like,
guys,

311
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.500
it's the same as masturbating,
right?
It's not like it's the same.

312
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:51.360
You Orgasm,
that's the same as it feels the same.
And they're like,
oh man,

313
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.400
so wrong.
That's so funny.
It's so,
it feels considerably better.
Um,

314
00:18:56.401 --> 00:19:01.020
what was I saying?
Um,
you still like the purple stuff?
No,
no,
no,
no.

315
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:04.650
Don't make sure it's exactly what you're saying.
Oh,
rubbish.
It was,
um,

316
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.450
wasn't even robot Thompson was that other stuff.
I thank well the real Nyquil,

317
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.090
the real nyquil with coding.
So I wasn't doing anything.

318
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:16.380
I did occasionally I would drink,
but even then I'd feel guilty.
Very,
very,

319
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:20.130
very rarely would try weed.
You're not going to pull it all the time.

320
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:25.110
He never drank.
Not much.
Didn't really drink.
I was trying to be healthy,
you know,

321
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.160
that was like a fight or two year olds trying to,
trying to be healthy.
Okay.

322
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.770
I was just trying not be a loser.
Um,

323
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:35.490
you know what it is to be a loser per yard.
We just not be that.
Yeah.

324
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:37.830
What's enough to just scare off the wolves.

325
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.150
So you've never done drugs or alcohol?
Pretty much.
Okay.

326
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:47.100
I got sick and I just felt like total shit man.
I was just,

327
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.290
I got hit with the flu or whatever the fuck it was.

328
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.480
So I took some Nyquil and I felt so

329
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.740
relaxing.
It's codene man,
whatever it said to take,

330
00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:00.660
I took more,
you know,
if it said the sake,

331
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:03.510
like if you weigh like up to 170 pounds,
Mike.
Yeah,

332
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:08.511
we're about one 90 and I probably weighed like one 69 but right above that I

333
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:13.170
took a fall.
I was lean son and have much fatty tissue.

334
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.840
I took a full dose once he's wearing,
took a ladle.

335
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.370
This nyquil fucked me up and I was,

336
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.500
I was deep in this pillow,

337
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.620
this down pillow and I felt so loved.
Really?

338
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.270
Oh my God.
If it was a love that felt like the universe,

339
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.880
she's just just rubbing me with love boy,
how it felt.

340
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.380
So what was in it?
What's in that to the old dean coding man.

341
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.010
Cody want drugs.
Coating.
It's a good one.
That's a drug.
That's the drawings.

342
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.580
What you used to take when you were a kid growing up before you would take like

343
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:47.320
one thing and he'd do it right before you go to bed.

344
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.910
You know like what can I find that you didn't give it still get it.

345
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.800
Go to your doctor's office,
coughing up before your doctor.

346
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.730
You get bronchitis,
you can get it.
You just need to start coffin.

347
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.140
Rough your throat up a little bit.
And how do they give it to you?
Now?

348
00:21:03.141 --> 00:21:04.060
A pill form or something.

349
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.000
Like if you're going to turn your girlfriend into the car,

350
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.070
you got to turn your girlfriend and the cops for domestic abuse.

351
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:10.570
She'd punch yourself in the face a few times.

352
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.690
She gotta do to get the Cody and you've got to raspy up your throat.
Man,

353
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.080
I got to fuck it up.
You got a cough a lot and they go,
this poor,

354
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.350
poor gentleman needs some codes usually way worse.

355
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.170
I notice I'm braved it out because of this doctor appointment.

356
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.380
I'm barely breathing and they hook you up with that dude,
dude,

357
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.760
dude,
I got a scribe for a wisdom tooth out and my doctor,

358
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.090
both of them done really good job,

359
00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:40.990
so it was like not really worried about this one.
He's like,

360
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:43.060
if you need these things,
if I could answer,
he goes,
if you don't need them,

361
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.160
I'm just goes.
I'm sure you can find maybe somebody,
I don't know.
I'm like,
dude,

362
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.740
I'm a comedian.
I have multiple people telling me to tough it out.
He said that,

363
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:51.760
let's say he allegedly,

364
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:56.620
so let's say that somebody could track your dental records.
Oh God.

365
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:58.300
It's like my friends did love it though.

366
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.890
Like you don't use those.
I'm like never been into them.
I'm like,

367
00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:05.860
well you might be that.
That stuff you're talking about is what like all the,

368
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:09.340
like the celebrity kids mixed with like you know,
red bull and shit like that.

369
00:22:09.341 --> 00:22:12.820
And they drink it as a drink.
It's like per called purple drink and stuff.

370
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.960
And that's all that,

371
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.110
although the Biebers and stuff that get caught with like the bottles of that

372
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.380
income.
What is the,

373
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.060
what's the mixture handler Sarah says or that's what they're drinking?

374
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:26.050
Codine Modine.
It's usually mixed with like mountain dew or something like that.

375
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:30.370
Or Wow.
Jolly ranchers.
There's a comedian,
I'm not going to name,

376
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:32.440
why don't you name names here that you fuck.

377
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.970
There's a comedian that used to have a real problem with Nyquil and club owners

378
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:41.920
would have to buy him like containers and bring them to him and he would drink

379
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:45.700
them like more than one a Dunkin.
And so he's a club owner and how to bring them

380
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:52.390
along time ago.
Wow.
Long time ago.
And that's why I had to bring it for him.

381
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.140
Fault and this guy.
That's pretty cool.
Well,
you know it's good.
Good,
good comics.

382
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.880
Well on it.
She's very good.
I don't know.
I don't think he was on,
it was on stage.

383
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.210
I think it's one of those things where you know you want to like fight the

384
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:07.330
demons on it and so at night you need some sort of chemical protection.

385
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.490
Take the coding and rally and

386
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.320
fight.
You see that guy?
Fuck yeah,
I did moment.
It came out.

387
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:25.030
I was first in line.
Oh,
nice hobby.
I love those movies,

388
00:23:25.031 --> 00:23:29.110
man.
Dragons and those habits were such cool dragons the best.

389
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:34.111
I rooted for him to fucking douchebags quits talking songs all the time.

390
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.480
Idiot.
Yeah,
man.
Lay too happy with yourself.

391
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.640
Yeah.
Oh you're,

392
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.650
we're all love their am deaf.

393
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.430
<v 0>Fucking dragon was so dope.
The Cgi they can do together.</v>

394
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:57.290
Oh my God.
I don't know how many people are working together on that thing,

395
00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:02.180
but the CGI that they were able to concoct what they're able to do really good.

396
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.130
Oh my God.
It's so good.
It does.
It looks like it's a real thing.

397
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.240
And there's another real thing that's interacting with like the CGI.
So good.

398
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.290
Especially with dragons because dragons aren't real.

399
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.540
So you don't know what they really look like.
Oh right.

400
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:21.620
You're kind of like use video wild.
But if you look at like a dog,

401
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.950
like when they CGI dogs,
it just looks slightly goofy.

402
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.810
They're just a slight goofiness to haven't totally overcome yet.

403
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:34.040
But they've overcome it with dragons and also with dinosaurs they don't move

404
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:38.710
quite right.
It's like what's your fucking why you move along that dog?
No,

405
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.560
I think hair is a big one.
Yeah.
And Harris tough to reproduce.

406
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.670
I think they have a real hard time like making like accurate looking ripples and

407
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:50.990
stuff like that because it's all done with programs and they have to use all

408
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.000
these like various technologies to figure out how to fucking shade things

409
00:24:56.001 --> 00:25:00.020
correctly and use the proper textures.
And it's like,

410
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:05.000
it's really quite slowly.
So your general look at those when like normal.
Well,

411
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:05.211
you know,

412
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:09.350
Clay Guido couldn't be in the early UFC games because he wouldn't cut his hair,

413
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.990
his hair down.
So Clegg weed.

414
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.460
His hair was so important to him that he chose to not be in the early UFC

415
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:19.040
instead of cut it.
Yeah,
because he's like,
they will,
I mean,

416
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.130
I don't know if anybody ever pull that hair and just yank it down or to fight.

417
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:25.520
You're not allowed to.
They're not allowed.
You used to be able to do that.

418
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.330
In fact,
hoists Gracie use chemos hair,

419
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.470
like it was a really important part of him.

420
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.110
He was beating the shit out of him from his back and then he set up an arm bar.

421
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.620
Wow.

422
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.270
But hoists was holding on to his ponytail like he had a grip on the back of his

423
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:41.810
head.

424
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.530
Like is ridiculous to give someone the ability to hold on to the back of your

425
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:47.960
hair if that's like a part of fighting Eric Paulson,

426
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.770
he's another guy who got in a bad situation because the guy was grabbing his

427
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:54.380
hair and punched him in the head.
Like,
you know,
I was like,
oh,

428
00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:57.320
you can't have hair like this.
If this is for five,

429
00:25:57.321 --> 00:25:59.930
it's easy to grab onto the handle in your head,
son.

430
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.650
It's like my bit about the fucking,
the,
the duck hunting guys.

431
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.620
The duck dynasty guys and their beard.
Oh man that thinks there.

432
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.980
Unless somebody wants to fuck your face.
That's the goddamn handle right there.

433
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.060
Who?
Buffalo.

434
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.770
This is the best way you gave them a handle to hold onto your mouth.

435
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.500
What are you trying to do?
What are you trying to do?
Leaving it open for me.
Yeah,

436
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:25.650
but what they can do it with,
um,
with dinosaurs and they can do it with dragons.

437
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.180
Great.
Real tragic park.
Had a great,
the first Tresor park.

438
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.070
Fuck you can watch on TV now.

439
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.920
He can watch it too because it looks terrible on the screen.
That was awesome.

440
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.920
Yeah,
I saw the new trailer.
Yeah,
it looks amazing.

441
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.970
Why would they go back there ever?
Why do they keep going back 10 years later?

442
00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.490
That's it.
What it is though?
Or is it a total reboot?

443
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.820
<v 3>Like A,
I don't know.
I feel like it's a reboot.
Like Spiderman,</v>

444
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.630
like they're either going back or they're going back and see it on that.

445
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.450
There's like a map.
You can see the quarantine zone.

446
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:58.380
Like you're not supposed to go here and fix the rest of the shit.
Okay.
Oh,

447
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.370
I wish we could play that.
Can we can we can play it on this TV trailer?
Yeah,

448
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:07.080
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
I hope it's in three d because I will already be running.
Yeah,

449
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.800
I don't think it will definitely will not be greedy trailers that we can

450
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:13.720
probably go blind by the end of the show.
Please find the class.

451
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.840
Does anybody feel uncomfortable?
Or is it just me?

452
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.430
It's a little bit uncomfortable getting out.

453
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.340
Maybe we should go without the glasses.
So they're going back.

454
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.330
Can we get some volume?
Yep.
So we'll listen to this.

455
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.610
Oh three birds over my head.
All the,
Oh,

456
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:30.910
you have tweety birds who put tweety birds over?
Said Birds.

457
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.910
It's rude
if someone chases you or something.

458
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.410
10 years ago they were killing people.
Don't joke about it.
Well,

459
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.580
we joke about Hiroshima.
It's true.

460
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.691
So what?

461
00:27:47.691 --> 00:27:52.691
We're watching people that are listening at home is a super dope yacht headed

462
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:57.941
towards an island that is populated and this little fucking kid pushes the frog

463
00:27:58.011 --> 00:28:02.090
so you can just say not everyone else was watching.
What'd your dad fuck face?

464
00:28:02.091 --> 00:28:04.430
Push it up front.
Can I get some manners?
You little cunt.

465
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.690
White privileged little CIS privilege.
White privilege.

466
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:14.900
CIS gendered gathering some balls.

467
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.090
Little suppressive asshole.
Now they're in these um,

468
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:24.180
trains and pots and they're just casually strolling around dinosaurs and then

469
00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:27.380
it's zero.
Yeah,
there's a shark suspended

470
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.490
and an impossibly huge dinosaur comes out of the water,
eats the shark.
Wow.

471
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:38.480
And ruins everyone's iPhones.
And you know what I realized when I look at that,

472
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.280
you got to feed that fucker.
A lot of sharks.
How many sharks?
Nothing needed day.

473
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.610
A lot.
Price is way bigger than the shark.
Okay.

474
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.800
I doubt they planned this awesome science shit.

475
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.880
Somebody super hot scientists for no reason.
I believable.

476
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.350
It's a super hot with bangs.
It was that Brad,
she's hot as fuck.

477
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.280
That guy's hot as fuck to this.

478
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.950
I was just wished this would turning the guardians of Galaxy too.

479
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:07.040
I haven't seen the first one yet because you're an idiot.
Oh,
how dare you.

480
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.120
That's a good movie.
Is a handsome bastard right there.

481
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.060
Also deer hunter.
Evacuate the island.

482
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.040
Look how pretty that girls there,
Ireland,
would you be willing to give it all up?

483
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.240
The whole Hollywood dream just to be in her arms in the rest of your life?

484
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.800
In harmony
every day.

485
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:34.130
Oh Wow.
Why are you saying I don't like this back?
She said,

486
00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:38.690
run
decker away.
Ooh,
I love the sound.

487
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.840
<v 0>Oh,
good Lord.</v>

488
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.890
The racing against who I swear out this wall and the velociraptors are running

489
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.930
right past and you from what it is,

490
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:53.010
they're all going to get killed him and some crazy super dinosaur.

491
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.670
It's a new super dinosaur.
Yeah,

492
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:58.720
like regular dinosaurs weren't funky enough for sure.
The the giant one,

493
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.030
they fed the sharks too.
That's coming back into play later.

494
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.090
That's not going to only be a plot point.
They're going to hit once.

495
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.540
I definitely going to be like disagree.
Really.
It can be it.
Yeah.

496
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.900
That's very possible.
That's it.
I don't think it is.
My pet said is not.

497
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.140
I think it's probably really expensive film,
Underwater Shit.
And they're like,

498
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:15.550
look,
we could stick to the jungles.

499
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.190
We could save about 75 million from the budget.

500
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.990
No way they're going to do it all.

501
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.130
[inaudible] brand has this underwater technology down pat.

502
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:27.790
He's the only guy right now because the avatar two and he's deep sea diving and

503
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.170
knowing the reg,
right?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's goes down.

504
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.900
He goes down to the bottom of the fucking old records
him.

505
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.990
Thank you.
Thank you guys.
Nuts.

506
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.440
He goes to the bottom of the ocean and he like innovates.
He like,

507
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:45.820
he's like one of those guys that's involved in the innovation as far as like

508
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.620
deep sea filming and exploration.

509
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:53.590
And he's going down in the little one man submarines and shit like,

510
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.420
oh,
that's where he's gonna die.
He's gonna die in one of those things.
Maybe not,

511
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.900
maybe not even more incredible.
We get through all this and he's fine.
You know,

512
00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:05.110
you get to see the depths of the fucking where no one has ever been a keys.

513
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.230
He's got enough money to do it correctly.
God.
I mean,

514
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:12.430
he's incredibly wealthy and begins a wife.
It's like with your next time,

515
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.160
you don't think I might have seen that stuff.
That's how annoying his wife is.

516
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.040
He goes to the bottom of the ocean.
They don't away.

517
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.160
Or could you imagine if that's what he said.

518
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:24.160
Can you imagine James Cameron?
Why did you go to the bottom of the ocean?

519
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:26.110
Cause my wife won't shut the fuck up.

520
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.560
That was his post game interview.
We're not saying it is Mr. Cameron.
Please,

521
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.370
please don't hack our plan.

522
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.520
We're humble servants of the Lord the overlord.
We love you.

523
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:42.880
I'm a huge James Cameron Fan.
I love that fucking movie.
He does cool stuff.

524
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.250
Not just that one level.
1 million of his movie.

525
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:50.390
God damn well want to pull up as I am.
They're making two SQL to Avatar,
right?

526
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.240
No Way.
Yeah.
Avatar to an avatar three is that what every brilliant two of them.

527
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.420
Yeah.
He's done so many movies,
man.
Um,
yeah,

528
00:31:58.421 --> 00:32:00.640
he did aliens right in a terminator movies

529
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.390
and he married,
he married the girl from the terminator movies.
Right.
Damn,

530
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:11.680
I'm going to fuck my star.
Never find a whole lot.
What?

531
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.610
How dare you fuck.
Take a lap.

532
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.380
Taking a lab.
I'll stand by it.
She's dating sex.
Oh,

533
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:25.180
she's so sexy.
She's tough.
Survivor,
Bro.
Three new avatar movies.
She's,
wow.

534
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:28.600
Three News.
There's going to be four of them total.
Yep.
Damn,

535
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.460
motherfucker did titanic.
Okay.
Oh yeah.

536
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.740
Titanic and aliens.

537
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.610
You know I had a problem with aliens and I still do monster.

538
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.040
What's the only reason I have

539
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.040
<v 3>a problem with this because I saw alien aliens is all of a sudden they became</v>

540
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:50.060
dopey and easy to kill.
Alien.
Alien.

541
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.200
The first one.
He's incredibly smart and slick.

542
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.610
Avoiding people.
Yeah,
and he finds a way to ambush you when you're,
you're,

543
00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:02.380
you're not looking to turn around and he's
always doing the movies.

544
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.100
They think scale wrong so that you can murder a town.

545
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.990
Thousand people trying to stop you,
but then one guy,
it's like difficult.

546
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.900
Just that one alien was that bad of an ass.

547
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.830
He was a newborn with no one to teach them the problem.
We no one to teach him.

548
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:17.930
Right.
He's the one who escaped out of the fucking belly and ran off.

549
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.320
That's a good point.
You're really living on his own.
That's beautiful.

550
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.740
You're right.
They wouldn't talk on his own.
He figured that out.

551
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.310
Maybe what we would do the fence.
I'm going to let him fix the alien populations.

552
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:31.610
Get them together like when they're really young and feed them only vegetables.

553
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:36.710
Oh,
you're right.
Turn them into vegans.
Change though.
Just give him beans.

554
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:40.520
Beans are fine.
There's a lot of routine.
The alien,
the alien.

555
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:43.810
We have a bowl of beans.
It fucking slammed his head to the door.

556
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.170
Try to try to kill you.
Keep it in some sort of a cell.
We have your be

557
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.110
fuck you.
Fuck God damn slim I can say are going to be Vegan.

558
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.880
They've should be Vegan by now.

559
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.470
It's this wigs you go to.
Try to get your,

560
00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:04.830
your retrade retrieved and his fucking teeth mark in it.
Big Shark Bites.
Sick.

561
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.480
Go get vegetables,
Mr Alien.

562
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.471
Okay.

563
00:34:12.471 --> 00:34:17.471
I'm not giving you anything but mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes and yams and

564
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:20.840
Vegan butter guy.
This guy,
he knows.

565
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.930
They just claws clawing every day for 16 hours,

566
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:31.350
clawing at the door.
Eventually they'll get calm and stuff.

567
00:34:31.351 --> 00:34:31.951
Just Stereo,

568
00:34:31.951 --> 00:34:35.540
just like they have to bring an engineer's to figure out when they're going to

569
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:37.880
get tired.
They don't seem to be any in tired.
If we get,

570
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.800
we should love the last year,
give him some meat.

571
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.890
All about the vaping experience.
I guide

572
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.510
of it.
That'd be a good sequel to alien Ellie and the Vegan.

573
00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.030
You imagine if something like
please take one right,

574
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.490
right out of the chest.
It explodes into a tube.

575
00:35:03.491 --> 00:35:05.290
Like we have the two set up on the guy's chest.

576
00:35:05.291 --> 00:35:08.170
We know he's going to give birth to the right when it breaks through a

577
00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:12.090
breakthrough in the world.
One of those vacuum things,
the over those hills lots.

578
00:35:12.091 --> 00:35:16.810
Yeah,
the mail slot,
those fucking things.
Sure.

579
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.570
That's the best way to get an abortion.

580
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.060
I met Jamie and I were looking at another,
uh,

581
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.590
a warehouse space and one of the spaces like podcast studio space,

582
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.950
one of the spaces had,
well,
those things in it,
it's still there,
open the cap.

583
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.380
He still worked in it and close it?
Well,
we don't know.
I mean,

584
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:35.680
we don't know if it worked,
but they had a thing there.

585
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.880
I had one of those fucking launcher things.
Cool.

586
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:42.510
And then people just knew he just went to the right place.
I there was like a,

587
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:44.760
I guess there was a destination on the other end,

588
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.000
like they had it mailed the mail room.
I don't know.
I mean I don't,

589
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.460
I think it might've been the place that we were looking at.

590
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:52.260
They did to all sorts of weird experiments.

591
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.290
So I don't know what the fuck kind of weird shit that we're doing inside there.

592
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:58.220
They were doing like missile technology.
Yeah.
Yeah.

593
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.810
We looked at like warehouses where they'd previously done like missile

594
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:03.660
technology shit.
They probably wouldn't even supposed to tell us that.
Right.

595
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.620
Probably those motherfuckers probably violated some sort of a constitutional

596
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:08.190
amendment.

597
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:13.190
We all start getting like knee cancer from just being there being cancer.

598
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.030
Yeah.
But they had a tube.
They had one of those.
Wow.
That's fun.
Yeah.

599
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.610
I would stick my hand in all the time.
Hold it back.
Of course.

600
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.810
Eventually w Dick in there,

601
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:29.640
right with a fleshlight was saw the bottom off of fleshlight or unscrew it and

602
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:33.850
just pure suction.
Oh yeah,
I'll just suctions.

603
00:36:33.851 --> 00:36:37.320
Someone's going to do it like it's pulling you back.
Yeah,
definitely do.

604
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:40.980
It might be built perfectly for imagined if no one knew.

605
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:45.690
But then like you get like the standard like mail slot vacuum thing and you put

606
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:47.730
a flashlight to and you're like,
oh my God,
look at this.

607
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.890
Schunk we just like locks in place.
Like funk like this.
This is like,

608
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:53.700
cause it's like,

609
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.270
it's like Indiana Jones where you like put the right thing into the wall.

610
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.250
Turn the key and the make it work.
Oh,

611
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.010
but then the worst part about that is after you calm,

612
00:37:01.011 --> 00:37:02.670
it would get shut up that fucking slot

613
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.050
into somebody's office and just catch her fucking facial.
No,

614
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.310
it goes right into the ocean and it feeds the fish.
It's biodegradable.
Oh,

615
00:37:12.311 --> 00:37:15.020
there's all set up just for that.
Totally.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.

616
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.040
You're building infrastructure.
Yeah,
it's in Malibu.

617
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:19.740
It's the same house that they used to film iron man.

618
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.130
We're just coming on dolphin.

619
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.360
Dolphins swimming in it and love the vacuum tubes leading out into the ocean.

620
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.960
Good Lord.
Yeah.
If somebody came up with something like that,
you know,

621
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:40.390
have you seen the latest stuff they're doing with oculus rift?

622
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:45.070
Not Wearing an oculus rift?
First Person Porn.
They're doing three d Marilyn know.

623
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.740
Yeah.
Virtual reality.
You have stuff on you.

624
00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:47.910
It's kind of like touch you and stuff.

625
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:52.110
Not yet right now it's just you're watching it and you're watching it and it

626
00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:54.870
looks like you're actually doing it.
Yeah.

627
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:58.380
But eventually they're going to be able to sync that up with something that

628
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:01.530
stimulates your senses.
You still haven't watched South Park Oculus rift episode,

629
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:05.640
have you?
No,
I have not got a Watson off this whole season of south park.

630
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.870
It's an amazing season.

631
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.230
Will help to guys don't watch one episode walked as the first season where the

632
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:11.670
whole season holds together as one.

633
00:38:11.671 --> 00:38:15.800
It's like a movie lines start at the beginning.
Yes.
It's,

634
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.880
I'm guilty of not watching South Park.
I'm really guilty.
I need to get on it.

635
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.050
Is it on Netflix too?
Uh,
I dunno.

636
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.300
It was like South Park studios is on an apple TV.
It's on Hulu Plus Hulu plus.

637
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.290
It's probably on the,
on the comedy central.
It's south park studios.com up there.

638
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.050
Well comedy central you,
you,
you use an htmi

639
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:39.300
<v 0>and to get it to you or the comedy central direct or CC [inaudible] dot com</v>

640
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.860
[inaudible] dot com that though,

641
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.830
don't they have like their own like apple TV and then they have,

642
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.930
they have their own effects.

643
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.730
If you have an iPad or an iPhone and you just use that happen.

644
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.260
The UFC has an APP now too in the,
um,
if you're doing an apple TV,
yeah,

645
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:57.730
they have an APP.
Like you got an apple TV and go to the UFC.
Dot TV.

646
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.140
You can go and watch the fight.
Fight Pass is available.

647
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.610
Yeah.
Dude,
I was watching the other day.
I was bored and I just said,

648
00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:10.830
let me just watch some old fights.
And I've watched like two hours of old fights.

649
00:39:10.831 --> 00:39:13.450
It just,
Kevin,
when choosing different fights,
he went running diesel,

650
00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:16.810
all those old,
all the,
each have their own symbol,
whatever on the,

651
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.230
whatever the fucking devices.
I haven't watched TV on a regular TV for her.

652
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.490
What did they have those things up there?

653
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:25.890
We can go to the Netflix one and the FX and little icons.
You Click.
Yeah,
yeah,

654
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.180
and he goes,
they all just have their live HBO girl.

655
00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:31.720
They all have their own live feed and you just appletv it until the TV,

656
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.870
apple TV is incredible.
The other thing,
once he goes grab them is live sports.

657
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:38.050
But now that I've got that,
you can watch live Fox live,
CBS,

658
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.120
it's eventually going to happen.
It's,
I mean,

659
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:42.400
why wouldn't they just get what you want to get?
Don't get it.

660
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.170
You don't want to get it to have it all available to everyone.

661
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.200
The regular television networks is going to be obsolete.

662
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.670
There's almost no way around it.

663
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.480
It's just too difficult to support that sort of model when someone can do

664
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:56.580
something like Netflix where they can have the entire season up in advance and

665
00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.800
events.
When you ready to hear it all is,
this is Marco Polo.
I'm watching,

666
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:03.790
you know,
have you seen it?
It's not a part of it.
It's fucking good dude.

667
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.690
And the entire season is in advance.
You just download the whole season.

668
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.920
He why'd he had been watch from the jump.
I mean it's fucking great.

669
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.710
They've got a good bottle.
Ah,
there's so they're killing it,

670
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.340
but they have like some insane amount of people that have subscribed because it

671
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:22.750
kept putting a good product in worldwide and 70 million people paying seven

672
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:26.080
bucks a month.
That's a lot of fucking people,
man.

673
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.630
That's insane that the money's insane.

674
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.510
They gotta keep putting it back in to look at and make a new shows and stuff.

675
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.830
Yeah.
Tammy,
same cards,
show cards and also standup specials.

676
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:41.260
They're great for standup specials.
Netflix,
they,
my first one,
uh,
my,

677
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.640
my,
my first legit one was,
I did it for Netflix then put it on showtime.

678
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:50.620
That was 2005 I was old Netflix.
They were always doing things like that though.

679
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.480
They've done a lot that the bill burr ones,

680
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:54.910
they did the black and white one from Atlanta.

681
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.280
It's for my special can be seen this Friday.

682
00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.980
How many central midnight,

683
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:05.410
11:00 PM if you're in the middle zones,
but he didn't get it right now.
Right?

684
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.130
Are you good right now?
Go to Ari shapiro.com or the great.com wait,

685
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.950
what are you saying?
It's right there.
It's available right now for download.

686
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:16.140
Hold on.
What don't you understand?
Oh,
okay.
Hold on.
Let's back up.
So Joe,
can,

687
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.380
we asked questions about that,

688
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:23.290
that you can get your special right now@alreadythegreat.com and it's not even

689
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:27.550
being uncommon.
Essential.
Yes,
that's right.
It's not even been on comedy central.

690
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.720
And you'll get the bigger version,

691
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.470
the 30 extra minutes that is fucking outrageous.

692
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.690
And a joy a yes.
Yeah.
The [inaudible] peninsula.

693
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.480
That is outrageous.
Have you ever seen the [inaudible]?
No.
Um,
yeah,

694
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:45.710
of course I have.
Man.
I've been there seven times.
The back of the comedy store.

695
00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.650
I ask you,
you a question to a question.
It was just fun.

696
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.620
It was there before it was a Jew and a,
or somebody came up with like,

697
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.060
and that's shorter.
The Q and a juvenile.
Yeah.

698
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.310
It was weird watching you a film that there,

699
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:00.140
that was one of the first days I ever came back.

700
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.370
I came back the day before that to watch the roast battle.

701
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.350
Unless you're used to just like,
I don't make a big deal.

702
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:09.620
You're special if we just get it out of the way now and then I go,
yeah,
yeah.

703
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:13.490
I wanted it to be,
I wanted it to be,
um,
I want to just to see your special,

704
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.383
take it in,

705
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.330
not as someone like I can't believe I'm at the store the very first time back

706
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.720
years and I'm seeing it already special being filmed.

707
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.950
I wanted to get that out of the way.

708
00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:25.100
So I got that out of the way first and I just,
um,

709
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.520
it was so weird seeing you up there doing your special like killing it.

710
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:33.710
Oh thanks.
It was a,
it was why weird?
Well not weird.
Like unexpected.

711
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.300
It just,
just surreal and so many different ways.
No one you,

712
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.830
as long as I've known you knowing you when you really first started doing it,

713
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:46.460
he wants to be on that stage fucking as a terrible new comic.

714
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.910
Well as a smart open miker that had potential.

715
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:54.440
That's what I felt.
Super Green Anyway.
Yeah,
but I thought you'd be fine.

716
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:58.790
I remember the moment I first started talking to y'all,
I was like,

717
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:03.160
this guy can do it.
Like all you have to do is just keep going like this.

718
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.200
I knew you were smart and you were funny and you know you were young and we were

719
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:13.100
all young and awkward,
but you were,
you had an idea.

720
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:14.000
Like if you had an idea,

721
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:17.690
you could say we could be all talking and you would say something and people go,

722
00:43:17.691 --> 00:43:19.610
yeah,
you know,
and that's all you need.

723
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:21.440
Then you have to be able to draw from that.

724
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.780
But I knew you were smart and I knew you were,
you know,

725
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.800
you were pretty driven to be a standup comic.
Like you really wanted it.

726
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.630
I knew you were going to make it.
I knew he was going to make it.

727
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:36.710
It was just one of those things I didn't,
no,
no,
no one can.

728
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:38.300
I mean that's,
that's just what it's all about.

729
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:42.080
I mean that's also part of what drives you to put in the work that takes you to

730
00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:45.310
make it.
We all know guys that started out at the same time.

731
00:43:45.311 --> 00:43:48.440
It's you that were really talented,
are gone like you were.

732
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.760
They had the same like kind of potential that you had.
You know,

733
00:43:52.761 --> 00:43:53.594
there's a lot of them,

734
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.910
I don't even want to mention names because I want to hear him.

735
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.420
I don't want them to hear this podcast to be bummed out and overall things went

736
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:02.360
on.
They didn't go on to become professional comedians even.

737
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.180
They just kind of got a job somewhere and they never figured out how to follow

738
00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:08.060
through.
But there's a few guys that we could talk about off air,

739
00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.510
so God damn good.
They were really good.

740
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.080
They had to watch their sets.
But I think that's for the,

741
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:18.470
for the guys who do get through it,
a stern warning,
like don't,

742
00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.010
don't think you're special.
Like don't think you can ever relax.

743
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:26.810
Don't think you can ever take time off of analyzing what you're doing and making

744
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:29.420
sure that you're doing it right.
Don't take it for granted.

745
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.980
Don't take the audience for granted,
ever.
Don't,
you know,
just,
well,

746
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.010
every level of development somebody dropped off.

747
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.160
So even somebody who's like how to hit,
you know,
special and then it's like,

748
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:40.950
then they drop off their,
someone else has a one good open mic joke drop off.

749
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.800
They are like at every level you're going to have it have however many people,

750
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:46.320
10 people at that level and it's going to drop off to three that makes it to the

751
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:49.080
next level.
We can all crash and burn.
Yeah.
You know,

752
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.720
one of the things is really any kind of is me,
you know,

753
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.110
one of the things that really excited me about being back at the comedy store

754
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.980
and also,
um,
like,

755
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.800
like deciding that I'm going to stay in La for awhile is that like this,

756
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.330
this area that we have now,
like the,
the amount of,
uh,

757
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:09.390
like cool places to work,
amount of cool comics,

758
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:12.930
amount of funny guys that are in this area that we're at right now.

759
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.520
This is really rare.
This is really,
this is a rare spot,
man.
You know,

760
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.660
we were doing,
we've done some of these shows at the ice house.
Last one we did,

761
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.340
I think it was you and bill burr and Joey Diaz and Brian Cowen and Ian Edwards.

762
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:29.730
And we're sitting around and where I was like,

763
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.760
this is the fucking most murderous lineup I've ever seen in my life and nothing,

764
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:38.400
I don't know when it says,
and we're all,
we all live here,
you know,

765
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.290
we all drive here a Wednesday night,
a hug each other,
smoke some joints,
you know,

766
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:43.921
and Brian,

767
00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:47.610
Brian's doing the icehouse chronicles is getting millions of downloads out of

768
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:50.820
the same spot.
You know,
you're going up there and,
and,

769
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:55.470
and you're killing it in front of this crazy Pasadena crowd to know about
comedy.

770
00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.680
These are crazy shows,
man.
I mean,
these are shows that are just like me and math.

771
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.750
We're always got into a fight over like la or in New York who has better comics.

772
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:05.580
But then I've always pointed like guys,

773
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:08.640
like it's like you developed their best ones and then shipped them off to us.

774
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.220
So like we're the Yankees.
There's no fucking,

775
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:14.650
we have to know the team there is no best,
it doesn't matter.
There's no,

776
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.280
it's all bullshit.
Like the idea of arguing about that.

777
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.250
There's two good environments for standup at all.
You know,

778
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.690
I think one of the advantages that you have coming from the La Model,

779
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:28.590
which has less clubs,
less sets,
so the New York model,
which is more clubs,

780
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:29.610
more sets,
more travel,

781
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:33.150
you're hopping back and forth from Club to club is that you,
you're,

782
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.030
you're coming from two different perspectives and I think that I like to both

783
00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.310
adamantly.
Yeah.
Like the boat.
There's,

784
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.650
there's weaknesses that each one has and they just can deal with it cause it's

785
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:45.250
that they're used to that scene.
Yeah.
I feel like your jokes per your,

786
00:46:45.251 --> 00:46:46.410
your laughs per joke,

787
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:50.790
the tightness of your joke has beginning become cleaner since you went to New

788
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.980
York.
Yeah.
In New York there's a lot of like,
come on,
get to it,
got through it,

789
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.830
you know?
Yeah.
I think that's a good thing to have.

790
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.220
But then also senator with something else where it's not all about like an

791
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:02.460
ironic level of just here's my writing joke,
you know,

792
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.490
they have a lot of that where it's not so much truthful is more like here's a

793
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:06.950
good joke about a thing.
Well,

794
00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:11.440
what I was going to say is I think that the combination of Combo brought from

795
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.090
the your experience in La and on the road and then going to New York,

796
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.620
like that's a good mixture.

797
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.010
And I think that ultimately that that's all you could want as a comic is like,

798
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.560
I think one of the things that's really important for all of us,

799
00:47:22.561 --> 00:47:25.710
it seems to be important when I watch other people do it when I'm outside of it

800
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:30.760
is live experiences equal funny equals perspective equals funny.

801
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.860
Like the more experiences you're having in your life,

802
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:35.170
the more material you're going to have.
You know?

803
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:40.090
And I mean experiences like go do something like go somewhere,
go do something,

804
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:42.290
go try something out.
Like bill burrs bit about,
uh,

805
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.380
go get your heartbeat in a helicopter pilot.

806
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.740
If you ever seen that bit and just get this new band special about learning how

807
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:48.880
to fly a helicopter.

808
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.980
I'm not saying anything more because it's just that it's that fucking good that

809
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:57.550
I don't want to ruin any of it.
I won't ruin it by saying the word helicopter,

810
00:47:57.551 --> 00:47:58.510
so I'll leave it at that.

811
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.770
But it's one of my all time favorite bits and it's a bit that he developed by

812
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:03.760
actually doing that,

813
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:07.120
by actually learning how to fly a helicopter and he actually can fly.

814
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:11.170
So I think that doing,
she's got a dog or that whole joke,

815
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.820
but like watch people cross the street,
he's coming up.
I was like,
yeah,

816
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:19.840
like the power.
He's got a lot of great jokes,
but it's,
it's living a little,

817
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.720
yeah.
Living,
experiencing life,
doing that too.
Yeah.

818
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.330
It's a whole different scene in New York.
Uh,

819
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.580
not just like the comics while I'm talking about the girls in the bars and the

820
00:48:28.581 --> 00:48:32.510
way you walk instead of drive.
Yeah,
just a new experience in general.

821
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.400
Like you get your fucking mind moving,
it gets everything fired up in a new way.

822
00:48:36.401 --> 00:48:40.210
And I mean even if you don't want to move somewhere,
I mean tried Jujitsu,

823
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.870
do something weird like different route to work everyday.
Try Surfing,

824
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.220
learn how to surf lesson and get out there and the in shark infested waters.

825
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.370
Santa Monica [inaudible] lifeline was like,
I lie.

826
00:48:52.371 --> 00:48:56.540
He just told her I need to blot out the little Dum,
Dum,
Dum,
Dum,
Dum,
Dum,
Dum,
Dum.

827
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:04.960
I worked this out in 10 countries.
There's material.
Oh,
that's interesting man.

828
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:08.140
I went to a bunch of different places and try as much as I could.
Well,

829
00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:11.140
you did a lot of comedy in China and we talked about in the last time you are

830
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:12.670
hearing with all that gutter oil stuff.

831
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.030
The last time I was here in June and July when I got back,
I was wearing,

832
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:18.680
when I got back from China,
it was it the last time?
I think so man,

833
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.280
you might've been here in between.
It's hard to tell.
Oh yeah.

834
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:24.390
Maybe I might go to share the type of special could be,
yeah,

835
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.190
I think you were doing comedy there for like a specific type of people.

836
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:30.020
It's like,
oh,
interesting.
All right.
Some stuff works.
I'm still,
does it,
do,

837
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.860
do they just go to see anybody who comes there every week?
Yeah,

838
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.360
they know about it.
A lot of them would,
but did it,

839
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.750
he'll read like this comics in town.
He'd be,
people seem to like him to be like,

840
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:43.870
oh,
maybe I'll go,
well,
he's pretty cool if you're in a spot.

841
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.440
If someone figures out a way to get really good comics to fly out all the way to

842
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:50.980
Singapore.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Form in front of you.
Like that's gotta be pretty fun.

843
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:54.620
Yeah.
Brent wind doctors got back.
Yeah.
Dude.

844
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.980
So weird and funny.
Yeah.
He's very funny though.
I really enjoy watching him.
Yeah.

845
00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:02.710
It's just outside the box.
Well,
we were saying it's like this is a great time.

846
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:05.050
There's someone needs,
there's so many good comments right now.

847
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.400
This is like maybe the best time of all time.

848
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.150
There's a bunch of good people doing good stuff and you're like,
yeah,
cool man.

849
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.790
Cool.
Yeah.
Like if you take yourself out of the manners,
yeah.

850
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:15.190
Take yourself out and then judge and says,
look at the system.

851
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:16.630
Like they'll go shows.

852
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:21.280
There's so many shows and there's also like the ability to promote oneself

853
00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:22.114
through the internet.

854
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.540
It's gotten to this point where you get to know people that me might have,

855
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:26.680
like you know we,

856
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.070
we've about many times about a Robin Harris who was like a really funny black

857
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:34.790
comic back in the 90s he died before anybody got to know who he was,

858
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.390
but he didn't really have the distribution who was in later a couple of movies

859
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:41.660
he did like a little bit,
he had a CD called babies kids,

860
00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.070
but he was just so God damn good man at the time.
But for whatever reason,

861
00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:50.180
the distribution method just wasn't available for him at the time and it's,
it's,

862
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:52.370
it's,
it's available now.
It's way better.
That's available now.

863
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:54.950
You can just find her.
That's why there's no squabbling over there.
Brian,

864
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:58.230
what are you doing?
I was just trying to get my sweatshirt.
That's what,

865
00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.630
there's no giant bands anymore.

866
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.600
It looks like you're on fire because you don't need a Beatles for everybody.

867
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:06.540
You would just need very specific things for very specific audiences.
Dave math.

868
00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:08.390
So they break it down further and further and he's like,

869
00:51:08.391 --> 00:51:09.560
you don't have to like Dave Matthews band.

870
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:12.050
You can like a little bit more of an upbeat tape.
Math has been,
well guess what?

871
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:15.170
There's nine bands that are playing that type of music right now and you can

872
00:51:15.171 --> 00:51:17.360
find all of them.
You don't have to wait for the radio to bring it to you.

873
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:21.230
That's a very good point.
So if you don't,
can't get these massive stars anymore.

874
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.390
Do you think that's true though?
I mean,
how does,

875
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.990
how's it Justin Bieber in marriage?
Is He kids music kids music?
Yeah.

876
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.100
The only way it works,
and he was still through those distribution methods.

877
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:32.210
Kids don't download shit.
Yeah.

878
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:37.070
I think that's probably best for everybody that doesn't know giant stars.

879
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.570
I think all,
yeah.

880
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.740
I mean there's a lot of people that essentially should be giant stars that for

881
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:47.741
whatever reason don't get considered in the same breath as like Jim Morrison or

882
00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:52.130
Janis Joplin or dead people.
Right?
Like,
okay,
Chris Cornell,

883
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:57.140
Chris Cornell from Soundgarden,
maybe one of the greatest vocalists of all time.

884
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.490
It was great,
dude,
he's a monster.
He's still around and right.
Of course he is,

885
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.480
but I mean,
if you,
like,

886
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:06.290
if you looked at like people who people like worship as being like all time

887
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:10.400
greats,
for whatever reason,
that guy likes slips through the cracks,
you know?

888
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:14.000
Yeah,
you're right.
Right.
You know,
some people just hold up and some people don't,

889
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:17.600
and you talk about 20 years later that guy's out may listen to spoon man.

890
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:22.040
You know,
when that guy had the most insane voice,
his voice is incredible.

891
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:25.310
Did you hear the guy took over for him?
Was that that band or the other band?

892
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.870
Who's the blackout to go for the white guy?
Give it to me,
Brian.

893
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.190
The black guy that took over for the white pie by white,
by down in a hole.

894
00:52:35.191 --> 00:52:37.870
He was laying down in a hole.
Oh,
uh,
it's all,

895
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:41.400
it's not Allison black guy took over after I got a new lead singer.

896
00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:45.620
He's laying Stanley sides.
Exactly like lions daily.
Exactly.
Like lines daily,

897
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:48.980
and you forget the fact that it's not Layne Staley until he sinks down in a
hole.

898
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:53.340
All right?
We realize we're going to play a little game of Youtube Roulette.
Yeah.

899
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.630
Cause you tell,
let's see if we get kicked off youtube by playing this.
Oh,

900
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:58.160
you think it can help you too by playing it?

901
00:52:58.161 --> 00:53:02.960
Why are we get kicked off all the time?
Why so?
I Dunno.
It just happens.
So,
uh,

902
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:07.070
let's see.
Let's play it.
Let's free information right at my body.

903
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.750
What's it called?
I have to find something with him and singing it.
Okay.
What's,

904
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:15.770
what's homeboy's name?
Uh,
look.
William Deval.
I it.
William Duvall.
Yeah.

905
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:19.400
Oh well let's just find out like some of their new shit.
He sounds just like,

906
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:24.560
he thinks the old name silly.
He doesn't seem like that doesn't look that black.

907
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.550
He is blogs like Sephardic

908
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:32.880
<v 3>notice I use that a really safe as the way to really articulate term Sephardic.</v>

909
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.490
Think there's,
I'm more cultured.
Thank you.

910
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:39.210
He's a semite my gain in the box.

911
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.210
That's the guy now that's a white guy with a guitar player.

912
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.050
That guy looks like he does math.
Wow.
Jerry Cantrell.
Listen,

913
00:53:46.051 --> 00:53:49.830
you should be in a fucking Nickelback.
Where is the black one?

914
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.250
Bring him to me.
He's so like,
he's so happy with life and everything else,

915
00:53:54.251 --> 00:53:57.810
so it's tough to believe like that.
He can actually sing about heroin.

916
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.280
Oh yeah.
Lights.
The only song going to buy from him,
dem bones,

917
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:08.370
dem bones thinks it all big.
Oh Wow.
Damn Bounds.

918
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.270
All that guy's back now you realize.
Yeah,
I love that.
Different angles like,
oh,

919
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:15.510
that's got a lag as fuck.
That was not the same dude.
At some point,

920
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:21.630
I got to hear what this dude sound.
Got to hear it.
Just fast forward.
Born again,

921
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:23.280
1998 but listen,

922
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:27.470
this is Layne Staley then this isn't the the black gentleman,
I don't know yet.

923
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:33.270
He's think it's both actual liens.
Stanley died.
He died in 2002

924
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:38.580
the band is signage to reunite for a benefit concert.

925
00:54:38.581 --> 00:54:41.940
That was the starting point for a new beginning of Alice in chains.

926
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.480
14 years.
They released a new album lead singer Wm to evolve.
Well,
what is this?

927
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:52.750
Why am I reading this?
Jamie?
Can I hear this gentleman saying where's yeah,

928
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.040
just fast forward a minute.
Where's the black guy?
Yeah,
you guys ready?

929
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:58.770
Putting Simmons,
what the fuck?
Kind of fuckery.

930
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:06.420
That's the guy who looked like him.
So it's about their journey.

931
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.610
Well that's not dude singing.
I don't know.
This is bullshit.
I want to hear it.

932
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.620
This is probably your biggest failure your brother had here.
I just,

933
00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:19.290
I want to say as an artist,
as an artist,
artists to artists,

934
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.820
shut up about your fucking journey.
You're not a hobbit.

935
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:28.320
Okay.
Your goddamn singer in a rock and roll band.
I know what you're doing,
bitch.

936
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:34.440
How dare.
Yeah.
Right.
They still overdo that.
I'm fucking shut up it river.

937
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:39.810
How dare you are the journey.
I had to take my own guitar case.
Yeah,

938
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.330
just my room for a top boots tied up with fucking sin.
You remember,

939
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.300
did your hike over the hill?

940
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:48.990
Dsa guys with leather pants and Hollywood's like a day when it's hot out.

941
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.150
He's like,
it's the only path they own.
Pair their fucking show pants,

942
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.290
but they're honest shit and I was melting inside ball bag.
Said Moran in there.

943
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.850
It's cooking.
It's like a fucking severe.
Jay Jimmy,
this is the second video.

944
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:05.850
I'm on.
Jamie come on two and I know,
my God,

945
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:10.800
this is Jamie's been top five William Deval songs.
Last couple of,
wow,

946
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.100
that looks weird with the three d glasses on.
I'm not happy with these.

947
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:18.370
Made a generally positive number.
Okay,

948
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.220
we get it.
We get sounds like a white guy.

949
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:28.090
<v 4>Yeah.
Sounds like but yeah we got it.</v>

950
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.300
How's your ball's been Ari?

951
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:34.420
Everything downstairs cause we never tried to you about your,

952
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:37.630
your balls and your buds and stuff like that.
Thought I had herpes.

953
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.790
Oh that's right.
Really positive.
I had herpes.
I mean really positive.

954
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.800
Like what was the symptom log on to one is 10 10 I was a nine I go,

955
00:56:46.801 --> 00:56:48.250
it's like fuck.
Well I got herpes,

956
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:53.470
the Sims is where I saw a scab on my dick and I was like,
well that's,

957
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:57.610
and then I looked it up on Google on images.
What else do you think it is?
Herpes,

958
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.560
herpes,
herpes scars or whatever.

959
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:01.900
Herpes outbreaks and it didn't look like most of them.

960
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:05.920
It looked about like one out of like 10 of them.
My case,
never had them before,

961
00:57:05.921 --> 00:57:09.010
but I was like,
look,
I'm not the most careful guy in the world.

962
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

963
00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:15.540
<v 4>I mean condoms,
condoms.
Uh,
so I was like,</v>

964
00:57:15.541 --> 00:57:19.020
well look,
it's caught up to me.
I guess this is,
this is fucking,
you know,

965
00:57:19.021 --> 00:57:22.140
get it now.
It's better than I got on one of 25.
I wish right now we could play.

966
00:57:22.141 --> 00:57:26.910
Damn,
it feels good to be a gangster
in 10 different countries.

967
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.610
At least I was in a bunch of countries.
And I was like,
look,

968
00:57:29.611 --> 00:57:30.720
this could have happened at any point,

969
00:57:30.721 --> 00:57:33.690
but I narrowed it down to who I thought he probably was.

970
00:57:33.691 --> 00:57:38.220
I called like three or four girls or girls.
Hey,
I think I've herpes,
uh,

971
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:43.420
uh,
you should,
you should go get tested and stop fucking Damon.
Like,
why am I,

972
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:45.990
I have a outbreak,
I have a herpes out,
but there's no way there's anything else.

973
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:48.720
I have a herpes outbreak.
Yeah.
Cause what else could it be?

974
00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:52.850
You just don't wake up and have a scab.
Exactly.
And,
um,

975
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.520
so I scheduled the blood work,

976
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:57.990
got everything taken care of and in the meantime we can know what's going to

977
00:57:57.991 --> 00:58:00.210
take us.
It's over Christmas weekend so it's going to take longer.

978
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:01.580
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:05.270
<v 4>And then while I was hanging out,
I was hanging out the stand.
How many club?</v>

980
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.930
Maybe the best club in New York.

981
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:09.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

982
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.750
<v 4>But I'm talking to the owner and Pete Lee,
this comedian and tell him my problem.</v>

983
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.000
And Pete was like,
you know I,

984
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:17.920
where is it like right underneath the hood of Your Dick?
I'm like,
yeah,

985
00:58:17.921 --> 00:58:21.880
right there.
He's like,
I had something like this once.

986
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:25.870
It was like a penile tear.
Have you done anything like rough lately?

987
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.090
And I was like,
yeah,
actually I noticed it right after unlubricated anal sex.

988
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:37.330
That's when I first noticed it,
but it just didn't go away.

989
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.110
And lucky you're alive.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
And that's what it turned out to be.

990
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:45.810
How do you have unlubricated anal sex?
That's like fucking hard,
bro.
Hard.

991
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.950
I know.
Spit you didn't spit on the task force was wet.
It was wet course.

992
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:52.720
Lame Duck.
And that jug is played.

993
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:59.770
Yeah.
You get it wet and then you fucking go for it.
I don't know this,
but yeah,

994
00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:03.040
what you gotta do,
but you just don't believe it's commercial lubricant.

995
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:05.680
So relieved.
Yeah.
And I'm telling you,

996
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.390
if you think your wife has been happy when you've called before,

997
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.210
after fucking three days on the road and not being able to call,

998
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:17.320
you've never heard.
You tell a girl,
oh,
I was wrong.

999
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.940
You don't have herpes.

1000
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.870
They get elated overcome with joy.

1001
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:27.500
Now do you think maybe you should have just waited till the results came back

1002
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:30.440
showing these guys and he just didn't want him to fuck somebody else in the

1003
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:33.800
meantime.
And then while I'm waiting to decide some other guy's life was ruined.

1004
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.880
Right?
Well,

1005
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:38.300
I heard this is there's will suck it up and take my lumps also on the other

1006
00:59:38.301 --> 00:59:41.210
level,
I figured I could tell them I'm 90% sure it was like a cop out.

1007
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:45.300
So I'm not like fully sag.
Look at habit.
We fucked.
I thought that,
uh,

1008
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.730
from what I understood when I got tested was that you can only test herpes while

1009
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:50.630
the outbreaks happen.

1010
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:54.950
Then the act actually spoon a little out of the outbursts that you can't really,

1011
00:59:54.951 --> 00:59:56.510
it's really hard to test for herpes,

1012
00:59:56.511 --> 01:00:00.500
so a lot of times you can get tested during like not an outbreak and be like,

1013
01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:03.680
oh yeah,
and then want to just positive for herpes.
I think it was an old tests.

1014
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.540
I think that was like 15 years ago.
Toast.

1015
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.380
They need Olympic style or if he's tough,

1016
01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:14.780
serious,
overcome his boy and throw in.

1017
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:19.170
I heard if you do pop it like you could actually taste it.
It tastes purpose.

1018
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.360
It's like a sweetness.

1019
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:25.640
How many different fucking puss wounds before herpes is like,
I got it.
Yeah.

1020
01:00:25.641 --> 01:00:28.880
You can't just say it once.
That much of the that was solving young bloke

1021
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.870
had it for a while and treat it.
It's a burgundy.

1022
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:39.800
Burgundy is the wrong
culture.

1023
01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.250
Swiffer around like a penis in your hand.

1024
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.280
Looking at next time that hoopy [inaudible] how many herpes is you have to build

1025
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.440
a taste to be able to taste.
They figured out a way to train.
Yeah.

1026
01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:56.340
<v 3>Dogs to smell cancer.
Yeah.
That's awesome.</v>

1027
01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.520
That's pretty great.
That's awesome.

1028
01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.060
You're telling me they can't put a dog at the fucking TSA counter smell for

1029
01:01:03.061 --> 01:01:06.720
bombs.
Yeah,
but they also were going to smell for weed.
No,

1030
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.900
only trained the smell for bombs.
What about the weed dog?

1031
01:01:09.901 --> 01:01:13.650
He needs a job to get him and fucking the Miami airport.

1032
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:18.480
All the wee dog,
he fucks up.
He thinks it's a bomb,
but it's really just weed.

1033
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.210
The poor guy.
We try to train him.
Listen man,

1034
01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:25.980
we don't want to send them to the pound.
Sorry.
Let's just take a few,
you know,

1035
01:01:25.981 --> 01:01:29.770
one or two we'd arrest some months.
Not going to hurt anybody.
You know,

1036
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.000
we're going to get more revenue in the system.
We're going to have

1037
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:38.100
<v 4>[inaudible] on our rights just for your right to raise money.
And</v>

1038
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.690
<v 3>you know what?
Sometimes out of that struggle comes to dialogue.</v>

1039
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:46.070
<v 4>No,
that's
important.
People.</v>

1040
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.900
Buzzwords.
Cops don't stop.
Don't just rob our freedom.

1041
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.110
They don't just say the children for a little while,

1042
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.470
<v 3>24 hours.
Maybe you'll snap them.
I'll tell you what.
My friend's son,</v>

1043
01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.420
the kid was a Ne'er do well.
He started going to jail and he got out of jail.

1044
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:03.680
He realized,
I don't want to go to jail anyway.

1045
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.350
<v 4>No,
that's not a reason to search every he American.</v>

1046
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:10.200
He got back on the fucking right track.
No,
no,
no.
I'm sorry.

1047
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.640
OPS and Jerry government.
You're not giving me good reasons.
Punched

1048
01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.500
<v 3>him in the stomach and I brought him to the Lord.
If you seen that video.</v>

1049
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:21.600
No,
you want to see something?
Sure.
Pull that.
If you want to see something,
great.

1050
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.030
Pull that video and then get ready.
Bonnie.

1051
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:28.680
A white princess money princess bunnies.
This money.

1052
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.490
Oh,
you talking about he about to see something that's going to disturb you.
See,

1053
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.220
before that you want to see a guy punch a guy in the stomach.
See that?
Yeah.

1054
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.360
He says,
pastor,
I was on my,
yeah,

1055
01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:43.400
pastor punches kid in the chest.
Look it.

1056
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.650
See me as soon as he starts writing pastor,
that's where it shows up.

1057
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:50.590
It's one of the first,
uh,
that's it right there.
This is sober day.

1058
01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:55.420
<v 5>Felix young man.
His name was Ben.
I mean this is really ridiculous.</v>

1059
01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.310
I was there for a few years.
He was just,
he was a nice kid,

1060
01:03:00.311 --> 01:03:04.500
but he was one of those kids.
It was always just,
it's a real smart Alec.
Oh,

1061
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.920
what's a bright kid,
which didn't help things,
right.
Made it more dangerous.

1062
01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:14.550
We were outside one day youth group and he was just trying to push my buttons

1063
01:03:14.861 --> 01:03:17.680
and he was just,
you know,
kind of not taking the lord serious.

1064
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.930
And I walked over to him and I went,
Bam.

1065
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.930
I punched him in the chest as hard as I cropped the kid.

1066
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.710
What'd you put them on the chat?
Just crumpled them.
And I said,

1067
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.990
I leaned over and I said,
Ben,
when are you going to stop playing games with God?

1068
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:37.720
I let that man to the Lord right there

1069
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.450
<v 3>sit that might be needed.</v>

1070
01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.510
He didn't give a good example of,
oh,

1071
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.560
what are you talking about?

1072
01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:53.880
The guy was just being a smart Alec [inaudible] had to leave,

1073
01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:57.040
just punched a kid and he was smart.
But that's bad.

1074
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.120
It was,
he was smart.

1075
01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:07.840
What a chump that guy is.
I love the word chump.

1076
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:11.860
Wow.
Just a straight jerk.
Oh my God.

1077
01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:13.540
Punched him as hard as he could in the chest.

1078
01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.620
You punched a little boy at youth camp and I said,
beg crumpled them.
Oh really?

1079
01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.210
When are you gonna take the Lord?
Serious
three tick.

1080
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:27.550
What was he making jokes wasn't Ari.
He wasn't taking the Lord seriously.

1081
01:04:27.551 --> 01:04:32.260
It's being smart.
Alec
punched him.
That's a grown adult.

1082
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.320
It's a grown man who's a teaching people leading people.

1083
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.890
He's got a microphone on.
Christianity should be illegal.

1084
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.210
It all should be illegal.

1085
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.170
Anybody telling you they know the answer should be arrested and you know they're

1086
01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:47.320
not.
That's false advertising.
They should all be arrested,
man.

1087
01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:50.590
You can't put on on food.
Even this crooked FDA,
you kept on food.

1088
01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:55.650
Tons of nutrients without any proof of nutrients kind of do that.

1089
01:04:56.770 --> 01:05:01.480
That's so true though.
Drew can't just say,
oh no,
no,
I know the answer.

1090
01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:04.150
It's like we could you show us how you do it all or you're just making it up and

1091
01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:07.900
taken photos of money.
So we just show me,
Yo,
you proof of this.

1092
01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:11.140
When Adam and Eve concept,
you've been throwing it in front of this congregation.

1093
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.400
What?
What?
What do you have written down?
Do you have any studies,
any,

1094
01:05:15.401 --> 01:05:16.910
anything with some veracity?

1095
01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:20.581
Yeah.

1096
01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:23.200
Would you look about him to take a step back and look at any level of religion?

1097
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:27.280
You're like,
oh,
what?
This might be garbage or this is garbage,
garbage,

1098
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:28.480
garbage.

1099
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.640
This is a bunch of people that we're trying to figure out what the fuck the

1100
01:05:30.641 --> 01:05:35.120
stars were.
No,
it was dark,
but it was great too long ago.
Cool.

1101
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:38.290
I have a job with the 10 commandments and my new special paid regular fee.

1102
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:43.030
You out this Friday night.
It's set.
Your DVR is funny.

1103
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:48.490
Don't forget a lie to the bureau's cover central Malawi.
She feels

1104
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.400
he's got to do special songs about.
I like,

1105
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:59.410
and it's funny
and it's funny,

1106
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.920
this Friday night,
is it censored or uncensored censored?
Online,
I mean on TV,

1107
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.520
uncensored.
Online.
Uh,
so on.

1108
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.880
If you have it on television that comes on after midnight,

1109
01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:12.140
they can do whatever they want.
Right?
They can have it.

1110
01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.050
There's stuff I'm able to get where they were like,
well,

1111
01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:15.670
we don't know about that.
I was like,
are you serious?
And I'm like,

1112
01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:17.950
oh actually it's after midnight oil.
Just fucking,
that's fine.

1113
01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.000
After midnight is the right spot.
Yeah,

1114
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.840
I guess all except you want more people to see it but more people can at all re

1115
01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:24.683
shelf.

1116
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:27.180
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1117
01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.750
<v 3>Like how many special ed again?
Last Friday night did it.
Really?
Yes.
That's great.</v>

1118
01:06:30.751 --> 01:06:34.590
So you've got a bunch of like publishing to feed more of a heads up so I could

1119
01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:38.880
have promoted it.
The feedback has all been good,
man.
It's,
I mean the,
the,

1120
01:06:38.881 --> 01:06:42.930
the matter,
the ratio to people that didn't like it versus liked it.

1121
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:46.440
It was way higher than my last one.
So that means I'm on the right track.

1122
01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.230
So I just,
I,
I think that,

1123
01:06:49.231 --> 01:06:53.760
like right now it's such an exciting time for standup and I'm so excited about

1124
01:06:53.761 --> 01:06:55.230
doing new shit.
Like I've never,
I don't,

1125
01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.030
I don't think in all the years I've been doing comedy,

1126
01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.960
I've had more fun doing it,
doing new stuff.
Fuck,
I'm loving it.
It's not,

1127
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:04.440
it's not like you're not trying to do,
well,
you're trying to kill it.

1128
01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.650
But just with newer,

1129
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.720
it's like taking a smaller bat and still trying to hit a home run.
Yeah.

1130
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:13.080
Well you gotta grow.
You gotta throw willow,
Bro.
She got to keep using fertilizer,

1131
01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:18.080
stata mulch pits on
compost gas comedy.

1132
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:22.540
Get your compost game up kid.
It's just,
it's,

1133
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:26.850
it's just,
uh,
it's an amazing time,
man.
I have so much fucking fun.
Yeah.

1134
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:30.000
Especially at that show in Vegas.
God Damn.
That was fun.
That was cool.

1135
01:07:30.001 --> 01:07:33.090
The Phoenix show was really cool.
That was fun too.
Yeah.

1136
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:36.270
<v 4>That's Terry Fator theater is really good for it and they got that fucking,</v>

1137
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.720
when I tell you the word,
I was looking for it.

1138
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:47.730
When I tell you the word I was looking for,
it's where clock toward.

1139
01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.410
I couldn't find that.
My brain wouldn't,

1140
01:07:49.411 --> 01:07:53.090
that I gotta Stop Smoking Weed and start reading.
Don't do it.

1141
01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.010
The Combo to one or the other.
I got,
I can't let this keep going down hill.

1142
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.710
I can't remember.
I've got to start working now.

1143
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:06.150
One right here.
I can't remember what the word is.
I've got to get you on it.

1144
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.810
I need Lumosity.
I need you to do some kettle bells.
Yeah.

1145
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:15.920
<v 3>Brain smoking
in London for fucking</v>

1146
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.880
<v 4>three days,
allegedly three days in London.
That was it.</v>

1147
01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:21.650
And then right back to it.

1148
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.770
Did you not know anybody there or something or is working to do this thing where

1149
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:26.960
it's where I was working so I was like quickly like doing,

1150
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.050
I didn't have time to like go out and try to find weed and then I just didn't

1151
01:08:30.051 --> 01:08:34.010
find it too much danger in another land.
Yeah.

1152
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:39.650
I got scared and take any with me.
Good.
That's smart overseas.
I'm always like,
oh,

1153
01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:42.770
how'd you know?
Sure.
No,
yeah,

1154
01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.470
to take it with me.
But,
but um,
uh,
yeah,

1155
01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:49.670
I just didn't find that name then you know,

1156
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.320
it's like what you said Celebrity Rehab,

1157
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:53.930
it's the easiest fucking thing to come off if you don't have any like,

1158
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.060
oh well yeah,
I sure would want some,

1159
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:58.490
but I've been working so I haven't time to do it.
Well,

1160
01:08:58.491 --> 01:09:02.780
if you watch celebrity rehab,
you see Eric Roberts on it.
Roberts,

1161
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:08.880
Eric Robertson,
everyone's shopping the shape and what's coming off.

1162
01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.740
Coke and meth like need to make it through and I will Robertson's drinking

1163
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:16.190
coffee,
reading the New York Times,
coming down off of weed.

1164
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.370
He had his fucking feet and slippers.
He was in a reading.

1165
01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:24.380
Everybody else had fucking crusty Mascara all over their face and tears.

1166
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:26.900
Fucking sadness.
Yeah.

1167
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:31.930
Bandaids over their major arteries and doctor fucking drew still won't say it's

1168
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.100
different than those other things.
Come on,
drew,
do you?

1169
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.090
You do know people that can't stop.
Yeah,
I know.
Yeah,

1170
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:44.750
but I know people can't stop doing a lot of share.
Yeah,
I know people can't stop.

1171
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.590
Tattoos can't stop gambling,
right?
Yeah.

1172
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.170
Wow Man.
We need glasses.
The Flyer looks really kind of weird.
Looks Mansion.

1173
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.770
I wonder if like,
if we keep the,
Oh my God,
when we take them off,

1174
01:09:57.771 --> 01:10:00.620
it's gonna fuck a regular.
It probably was already fun.
I go over the blue,

1175
01:10:00.621 --> 01:10:02.300
it just goes off.
I go to my left side.

1176
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.520
The plane just goes off gay gays into the burning magic.

1177
01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:12.110
You went to see this whole table.
We'll table projection.
No,

1178
01:10:12.111 --> 01:10:14.290
I don't want to see that shit.
It's cool,
man.

1179
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.090
I've never seen Joe react so horribly done.

1180
01:10:17.091 --> 01:10:21.610
Intimacies of technology added new layers to games.

1181
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.533
<v 0>It doesn't.</v>

1182
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:29.930
A real pool table is played with fucking traditional lights and regular balls.

1183
01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:34.670
You keep everything clear.
This is ames,

1184
01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.820
Mr No bar,

1185
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:41.150
no table to table bowling alley.
I'll see the bottom way.

1186
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.560
Still felt but see through phones and no fucking

1187
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.880
<v 4>whole time.
Yes.
No.</v>

1188
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.670
Maybe you could play TV so you can watch the big game while you're lining it up.

1189
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:54.590
<v 0>You hate money.
Go ahead.
If you want to win,
you can't play like that.</v>

1190
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:59.890
A pool table supposed to be a green landscape of opportunity of collisions,

1191
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:01.400
of maneuvering,

1192
01:11:01.401 --> 01:11:06.401
of English and spin and reaction to choc and balls colliding.

1193
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:12.530
Slide and follow and draw.
That's what supposed to be not pussy and glass.

1194
01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:15.660
That's supposed to be looking down at a fucking glass table.
That's horse shit.

1195
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.700
Now that that,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's not what it's about.
Get your own.

1196
01:11:20.701 --> 01:11:23.190
Make your own new game.
Okay.
How about you?

1197
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:26.890
Just what I'm saying is he on a table?
Because my last tape,

1198
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.520
their chest to instead of having straight up and down and so they would have the

1199
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.570
go like this like lines.

1200
01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:35.820
You couldn't really see where another opponent was really couldn't really

1201
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:39.760
visualize it.
Yeah.
Like you'd have the corner ones.
What's go?

1202
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:42.450
What's your goal with the alcohol battle chess.
Oh,
uh,

1203
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:47.370
rooks maybe bishop bishop is yes,
and they'd be like almost right above you.

1204
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:48.330
So like,
well they can't get me.

1205
01:11:48.331 --> 01:11:51.150
But then you look at the way it's like curved and be like,
oh,

1206
01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:55.500
it's right in the dark is the castle right?
Rook is the horse.
Yeah.
No,
no.

1207
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:57.660
The castles.
The rookie,
right?
Yeah.
The night.

1208
01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:01.810
What night is the horse night isn't worse.
I have wow.
For a game of,

1209
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:03.060
for intelligent people,

1210
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:08.150
we couldn't even remember the last time you ever even tried to play around with

1211
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:13.650
it on my phone.
Like maybe a decade ago.
That was it.
What did you guys like?

1212
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:17.280
Chinese checkers?
I was always a Chinese checkers.
Chinese checkers?
No,

1213
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.370
that was always my favorite things.

1214
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:22.640
You could play up to like I think five people or something.
Oh yeah.
All marble.

1215
01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.760
There's a Jewish star square park.
You ever go there and watch shows?

1216
01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:31.080
Chess players,
they hit the clock and they slap the clock.

1217
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.190
They only get so much time.

1218
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:37.250
That's amazing stuff because they're really thinking about this grand plan on

1219
01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:42.831
this board and where all these pieces have opportunities and creative and

1220
01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:47.010
they're doing it on a clock.
God,
I'm dumb.
Ah,
I feel so stupid.

1221
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:51.090
And they're like homeless people too that are playing in there.
Well winters,

1222
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.390
the thing about pool and the thing about chess and thinking about this,

1223
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:57.570
a lot of these games that are stroke grossing,

1224
01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:02.810
you get so locked like sucked into them that it takes over all your older ideas.

1225
01:13:04.591 --> 01:13:06.350
Like there's a lot of bachelors,

1226
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.790
some bachelor in some shitty apartment and you don't,

1227
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:15.240
you just give up on having a girlfriend and he just gamble all the time and he

1228
01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:19.140
gets sucked into that lifestyle and you see that a lot of times with like pool,

1229
01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:23.340
you see that a lot.
And so the pool hall Groupie,

1230
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.730
like describe her when she gets passed around.
This is a groupie like three.

1231
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.020
If you can think of anything.
If you could think of like a miniature golf,

1232
01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:33.810
there's probably a miniature goal.
It's Tommy dilutes showed me who the Po,

1233
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.080
the bowling groupies was were right after I would send the UFC groupies.

1234
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:40.380
That's when I realized everybody's got a group here are definitely pool hall

1235
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:44.070
groupies.
They looks interesting.
They will go for the best players.

1236
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:47.700
They always want to date the best players.
Not about looks or young.
No,
no.

1237
01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:49.620
There's like dudes who aren't that good looking,

1238
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:54.000
but they're really good players and they'll get like pretty good lucking pool

1239
01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:57.780
groupies because the pool player girl like really wants to be associated with

1240
01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:00.250
like a world class player.
Oh yeah.

1241
01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:05.280
Or they pull players too sometimes.
Yeah.
Most of the time.

1242
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:06.660
Most of the time,
yes.

1243
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:11.750
Usually the ones who are like plague or pool players as well.

1244
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.120
<v 3>Then they really appreciate how good a guy is.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So there's like this,</v>

1245
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:19.870
but this,
I think that's the way with everything,
the cello players and fucking,

1246
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.090
you know what mean in male to female as well.

1247
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:24.580
I think there's men that are just obsessed with the way a woman's sings.

1248
01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:29.380
They become,
you know,
fan of that.
It just no getting around it,
you know?

1249
01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.960
Yeah,
yeah.
We're impressed by shit.

1250
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:35.450
You just stay in that world and like it's all I all I care about to then that's

1251
01:14:35.451 --> 01:14:36.640
sweet.
Of course.
That's what you want to fuck.

1252
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.440
If the guy's a bad ass pool player and that's all you care about is pool and

1253
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:42.010
that guy's doing magic up there.
I was talking about David Letterman.
It's like,

1254
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:44.770
well the problem was he used his power to to get laid.
You're like,
oh,

1255
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:46.960
you mean you can't build up a bunch of power than use it?

1256
01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:51.340
What do you mean half the reason the bill power to become the president?

1257
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:55.540
So girls would want to fuck.
He was like saying,
I won't keep you this,

1258
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.430
this promotion without you fucking,

1259
01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.060
it's they're saying they just come in wanting to fuck because I'm president,

1260
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:03.670
Bill Clinton and I supposed to suddenly he's go,
no,

1261
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.020
that's wrong for me to accept.

1262
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:10.170
And you're also supposed to deny a fucking Mongolian generations of conquerors

1263
01:15:11.021 --> 01:15:13.080
in there whore mongering way.

1264
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.200
And you've used serp them to become the fucking king of the world.

1265
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.840
I mean that you're trying to play the part once is the king of the world too

1266
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.940
good.
I don't get late because of this system of all his nose in our country.

1267
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:28.780
Fucking 200 years ago he's a no bull was Melbourne Cif here.

1268
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:34.150
Nobody's at noble.
Even the fun horse.
He'd be game of Thrones.
No.

1269
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:36.760
Well,
the game of Thrones is like really even the good guy,

1270
01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:38.830
he fucking cheated on his,
on his wife.

1271
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.580
That's why I had that faster Sud that they sent to the fucking castle because he

1272
01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:44.980
cheated on his wife.
Right?
That's right.
That's a good,

1273
01:15:44.981 --> 01:15:48.480
that's the best man that's ever been in that fucking world.
That's true.
And He,

1274
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:53.650
spoiler alert,
let's not say anymore.
She's not the rare,
stop it right there.

1275
01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:57.750
You know this is episode 600.
Yes,
that's crazy.
Episode 600.

1276
01:15:57.751 --> 01:15:59.470
I just did it as a 200 this week.
I'm skeptic.

1277
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.130
Is that the same thing?

1278
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.980
800 episodes between us?

1279
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.970
That's what I'm fucking talking.
Yeah.
Shocking him out.

1280
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:21.160
Jesus ain't,
have you done anything interesting on your podcasts lately?

1281
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:22.690
Like top because,
uh,
you've,
uh,

1282
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:26.440
my favorite one was the one where you had a talk with a hooker back in the day.

1283
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:27.670
I've had a few good ones like that.

1284
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:31.700
I had this guy who helps run work at the insight at that Vancouver placed with

1285
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.210
safe shoot up place,
safe shoot up place hasting streets.

1286
01:16:35.211 --> 01:16:37.510
I'll fucking zombies and fucking heroin addicts.

1287
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:40.420
And so they offered a safe shoot up place where you can tell them what you're

1288
01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:40.700
going to,

1289
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.150
we're just going to shoot up on and if something goes wrong and they can tell

1290
01:16:43.151 --> 01:16:46.480
the paramedics how to have a broad view.
And so it's just not,

1291
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:51.040
so it's not this dangerous and they give why the cops don't bug it.
And then,
wow,

1292
01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:55.390
they told me all about that.
What is like,
this is fucking going on.
And you know,

1293
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:58.230
she's just regular questions.
It turns out there's no fucking going on.

1294
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.030
It goes when you bought heroin,
that's sex drive goes way down.

1295
01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:03.843
That was a good one.

1296
01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.360
And then this week's about the open mic at the comedy store and that was a

1297
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:10.520
really good one.
The open mic,
you know,
potluck.
Wow.

1298
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:15.590
Talking about how it pretty much got it chopped in half and how it's not as,
no,

1299
01:17:15.591 --> 01:17:18.080
this was about the heyday with the,
with the,
it was the freak show.
But the when,

1300
01:17:18.081 --> 01:17:21.960
when you hosted it,
when it was just a freak show.
I'm giving up on his glasses.

1301
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.580
Yeah.
I mean having an aneurism.

1302
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:29.750
Let's do them backwards for oh to see what the authors are

1303
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.080
different color a little bit.
Yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
So much better.

1304
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.930
Oh it is.
It definitely don't wear this for an hour or more.

1305
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.340
Just kind of look at the shirt at him.

1306
01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:44.570
We did like almost two hours to those stupid fucking just got to look at the

1307
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.000
shirts like wow,
cool.
And then take them off.

1308
01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.480
So when I hosted it was like,
um,
yeah,

1309
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:52.130
I mean you host the employees and the showcases,

1310
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:54.320
but before that part is the potluck part.

1311
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.990
Where's the fucking 20 pure open micros,

1312
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:59.990
which could be the guys like me when I started or can be fucking sky was like

1313
01:17:59.991 --> 01:18:02.570
boom,
Shaka Laka.
When did I host it?

1314
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:05.750
If just that one time I almost regular open mic night.

1315
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:07.870
I hosted people like going on for the very first time.
Yeah,

1316
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:11.390
that's a Bob check did for years.
That's what I did for years.

1317
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.280
Oh shack is a funny fucking dude.
I'm,
I'm just always amazed at Bob.

1318
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:19.320
Oh Shaq didn't become like some sort of levy came.

1319
01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:23.000
One of the head writers that I'm at,
I'm forgetting,
but I would,

1320
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.600
I have thought that he would be like a host,
a Letterman,
like a famous guy.

1321
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:31.220
Like he's really funny and really nice.
I think that was a super nice,

1322
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.960
really cute man.
Only fucked his wife ever one of those guys.
It was just like,

1323
01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:38.870
like,
like you know,
Polo shirt.
He's funny shit too,
man.

1324
01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:42.380
I think he really loves being in a fucking writers' room and just churn it out

1325
01:18:42.381 --> 01:18:45.380
jokes and I think he loves doing that.
Give me the topic.

1326
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:49.640
I'll hit you with a fucking state hours worth right now.
I just,

1327
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:52.400
I've always thought that guy was going to be like some big household name.

1328
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.930
Like I remember watching him.
I'm like,
he's so composed.
He would have his bets.

1329
01:18:56.931 --> 01:18:59.540
He's like the opposite extreme of people who write on stage.
He wrote,

1330
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.720
he was like 98% done with his bits when he brought him up for the first time.

1331
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:05.180
I didn't wild.
Yeah,
he was the open my coast.

1332
01:19:05.181 --> 01:19:06.500
He was the potluck hosts when I started,

1333
01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.430
so he was like the first professional comedian and I saw over and over again,

1334
01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:15.740
powerful Babo shack bubbles out there representing Middle America.

1335
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:19.380
Where's he from in La?
Some weird corn,

1336
01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:24.030
Tennessee or Alabama and those weird spots.
Oh yeah,
he wears it.

1337
01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:27.230
He wears it for sure.
It wears it like a shield,

1338
01:19:27.231 --> 01:19:30.860
like one of those motorcycle jackets that you would pants off.
She elbows.

1339
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:33.830
It's going to be the best jokes.
Just talking about like it's okay to look.

1340
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:36.680
That's all right.
But as long as you don't hop on her,

1341
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.080
like she's the last chopper out or nom.

1342
01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:46.670
That's good.
Like lines.
He's a good writer.
Ren.
Yeah.
Funny Dude.

1343
01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.210
And just a good dude.
It comes around once in a while.
He's cool.

1344
01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.710
Does he still do stand up a little bit,
but Tommy would kind of was like,
hmm.

1345
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.650
Kind of push them to the side.
So I think now he's back a little bit more.

1346
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:02.390
That's really unfortunate.
Yeah.
Like I should get spots,
but that's uh,

1347
01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.720
you know when you're primarily focused on one club and you have a bad

1348
01:20:08.191 --> 01:20:11.850
relationship together,
that one club,
but it was time out with Mitzi too.

1349
01:20:11.851 --> 01:20:14.310
But to give him like one spot a week and it's like once a month and it's like,

1350
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:18.840
why?
She just like didn't want any more,
I don't know.
But it,
same thing though.

1351
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:21.960
It's one club.
You're talking about one guy letting you say yes or no.

1352
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:26.430
Isn't there something when you see certain guys where you go,
okay,

1353
01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:29.940
I think if you don't really pay attention this guy,
you might see it one way,

1354
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.340
but if you,
if you follow him long enough,

1355
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:35.400
you realize it's like all these layers underneath there that you,

1356
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:37.690
that you weren't even saying.
Yeah.
Like you're looking at him.

1357
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.290
You might judge them.
Oh look at this guy.
He's wearing a tie.

1358
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.460
He's on stage those glasses on and he's trying to be cutesy.

1359
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:48.120
He's trying to be proper.
But then like you watch him a few times he'd go,

1360
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.010
oh this guy is like really funny.
He's just making a presentation.
Yeah.

1361
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.900
That's just how papa's you're like,
yeah,
why are you wearing a suit man?

1362
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:59.360
Oh you're not a suit comic.
He doesn't wear this.
Yeah,
you're,

1363
01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.790
it's like we're being prejudice.
Yeah,
exactly.
Love it.

1364
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:04.680
Cause he wants to look good.
We're like fuck you.

1365
01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:09.900
Where it's like if you like what on TV?
On some television show,

1366
01:21:09.901 --> 01:21:12.840
like the tonight show with Johnny Carson,
you had a Hoodie on

1367
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:17.290
fucking wear something nice piece of shit.

1368
01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:19.900
You're not happy to be in front of us like it's your birthday there.

1369
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:22.820
Some old jazz singer who got one trombone,

1370
01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.960
it's one of the greats like Dizzy Gillespie types and he was like,

1371
01:21:24.961 --> 01:21:26.910
the one thing I was told was,
I know it was living out of my car,

1372
01:21:26.911 --> 01:21:29.520
but they were like,
find yourself a good suit when you're on stage,

1373
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:33.360
you gotta you gotta put all the most important when you don't have money.

1374
01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:37.590
That's why those nouveau reached Nirvana type motherfuckers had millions of

1375
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:41.310
dollars nowhere until word added up to these honors all stars or to but one

1376
01:21:41.311 --> 01:21:41.890
button missing.

1377
01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:46.530
Like that was almost like a badge of courage that they like kept their wardrobe

1378
01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:50.130
as real as possible.
You know,
I get it.

1379
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:54.390
If you do that at the MTV video music awards or whatever the fuck you,
you know,

1380
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:56.490
you can do where every fuck you want.
When you're in Nirvana.

1381
01:21:56.491 --> 01:22:01.200
You don't have to wear suits.
Going to Kurt Cobain to wear a suit.

1382
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:05.700
If Kurt Cobain went on stage with a Sudan,
that would be him fucking with you.

1383
01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.840
Like what are you trying to say?
Yeah.
The first time that night he'd be like,
ah,

1384
01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:11.160
I don't get it.
Why they were in a suit like,

1385
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:15.330
oh that's Kurt Cobain wearing a suit.
Yeah.
Like yeah,
you're right.

1386
01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:16.710
Sometimes people just don't see it right away.

1387
01:22:16.730 --> 01:22:20.730
Like I wish you could see or comics sometimes choke under showcased situation.

1388
01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:23.380
That's definitely true.
I've done it too.

1389
01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:27.500
That's done on the auditions.
I've done it on an important sets.

1390
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:31.010
Even your average is better than that.
It's hard to him.

1391
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.330
I said like 20th percentile instead of,
yeah you could.

1392
01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:39.160
I mean up till the time you record a special,
like when you're,

1393
01:22:39.161 --> 01:22:41.130
you're trying to develop new material,

1394
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:43.380
there's always the possibility that I could go wrong.

1395
01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.880
There's always that possibility.
That's all.
Dave Smith is comic Con New York.

1396
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:50.520
Cause they were like actually a really good political comic.
But he's no,

1397
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:55.290
when he went up with the seller and it would just fucking show and thought that

1398
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:57.330
he had a way to route for her to come tell him no,

1399
01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:02.400
but maybe because we're always hold off in the back of your head like,
but maybe,

1400
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.410
maybe she'll be like,
well that was good.
You'd have a good setup.
And I like it.

1401
01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:11.000
<v 4>No,
just goes,
yeah.
Obviously I didn't do it right.
And also the Lariat,</v>

1402
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:13.900
I wasn't there so many times.
I felt so bad for him.
I was like,

1403
01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:18.610
I've been there waiting.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe she'll just,
she'll,

1404
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.590
ah,
no,
but they won't.

1405
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:24.480
There's nothing crazier than watching someone perform in front of Mitzi and here

1406
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:28.160
go,
he's terrible.
Ah,
have this day.

1407
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.940
Gosh.
Brutal.

1408
01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:35.650
Nall piss my dream packs.

1409
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:41.110
Give the back hand wave away.
You have dealings with her at all?

1410
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:45.690
<v 0>Yeah,
a lot.
Yeah.
In the 90s she was lucid.
Yeah.</v>

1411
01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:47.790
She was a,
when I first met her,
she was,

1412
01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:52.180
I had many conversations with her about comedy and what I was doing wrong.

1413
01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.500
<v 4>You say what she did wrong.
Yeah.
She was going to point out.
She goes,</v>

1414
01:23:55.501 --> 01:23:59.730
you don't do no stuff in the beginning.
Yeah.
Barry at the mad cow.

1415
01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:04.770
<v 0>Yup.
No,
she's right about that.
She was always really smart about challenging you.</v>

1416
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.650
So she would give you these sets where uh,

1417
01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:10.020
you would go on after I started killer her,

1418
01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:13.020
whoever she thought I was going to do the best she would shove you right

1419
01:24:13.021 --> 01:24:16.770
afterwards to teach you like collect.
This is what it feels like to be nobody.
Oh,

1420
01:24:16.771 --> 01:24:17.310
you think you're good.

1421
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:22.310
You're good to go off to this Guy Martin Lawrence in 19 nine is five good

1422
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.910
fucking luck.

1423
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:27.980
<v 4>Yes,
soldier God,
that would have been such a hard spot.</v>

1424
01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:30.890
I took those spots there.
Martin Lawrence.

1425
01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.060
I had many of those spots in the main room and killer too.
He wasn't just famous.

1426
01:24:35.061 --> 01:24:38.200
He was eight hiller plates of dry bum shot

1427
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:43.410
waiting for the light to come on please.

1428
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:47.330
I bomb going on after that guy.

1429
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:49.760
Here's when you know you're bombing in that room because it's so quiet.

1430
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:53.090
When the neon light goes on,
you hear
and you're like,

1431
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.250
I don't even have to look over.
I know I'm done.

1432
01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.580
Warm.
Your skin gets empty.
It was a change in your forehead

1433
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:06.770
to Sanchez.
Said it.
Cause she made a phone with the ice every night.

1434
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:10.460
Then he said he tried to be like extra dirty and that didn't work and they tried

1435
01:25:10.461 --> 01:25:12.590
to be extra clean that didn't work.
And then he was like,
well let me just

1436
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.640
<v 0>do what I do I guess.
And that was like what worked well was doing,</v>

1437
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:16.720
just trying to be funny.

1438
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:21.220
You just have to accept your fate to the very least.

1439
01:25:21.221 --> 01:25:24.940
You got to prepare to dig your way out of the ditch in front of you.

1440
01:25:24.941 --> 01:25:29.830
Just keep hammering away at it.
Don't lose your composure and don't,
don't try to,

1441
01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:33.160
you just got to submit to the fact that you'll never be better than Martin

1442
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:33.993
Lawrence and right.

1443
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:38.480
<v 4>Yeah,
exactly.
Cause there were good relaxed,</v>

1444
01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.490
you're not going to kill the Jaycees those as good opportunities because like

1445
01:25:41.491 --> 01:25:44.130
the crowds in an awesome mood.
Yeah,
just kind of that's true.

1446
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.260
And then some of it's being a comic and having to be like,

1447
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:47.220
it's not just my material.

1448
01:25:47.221 --> 01:25:51.120
I gotta fucking move and shift with the fucking new room.
Well,
it's awesome.

1449
01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:55.950
<v 0>Big J in 2015 is way better than I was.
Right,
right,
right.</v>

1450
01:25:56.610 --> 01:26:00.830
<v 4>I saw some most dogs
and he did this whole thing where it's like you got,</v>

1451
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:04.250
cause it was just like,
you know those are big moments for a comedy.
Right.

1452
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.880
<v 3>And he's like,
you guys just got Louis Ck.
You did.
That's not fun.</v>

1453
01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.270
You can come in here thinking you were going to see him fucking 1145 at night.

1454
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.790
You saw that and was like,
yeah,

1455
01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:16.490
they're getting now he's pulled him into his own wave wavelength with like 40

1456
01:26:16.491 --> 01:26:20.680
seconds of that and any mouth fucks mall and that he mouth fucks all above his

1457
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:23.990
roars and how you're going to listen to my stories of childhood.

1458
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:28.880
I liked me and he fucking killed.
But it's that technique of being able to like,

1459
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:32.210
let me pull them in here.
Like being a legit comic.

1460
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.050
Steve Simone is easily in the top 100 and nicest people ever to end to show

1461
01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:39.140
business easily.
If ever.
People that have ever lived,

1462
01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.580
he's easily in the top 100 nicest.
Oh yeah guys.
So Nice.
So Nice.

1463
01:26:43.581 --> 01:26:46.910
He's such a friendly guy.
Like,
who the fuck doesn't like Steve Simone?

1464
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:50.110
Finally like Bruce?
Tell me you don't.
I'd never really experienced it.
I've never,

1465
01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:53.000
if you tell me you don't though,
then it's like something's wrong with you.

1466
01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:57.280
Come on my Carmichael,
draw a crime.
Say No to rods.

1467
01:26:57.281 --> 01:26:59.260
The second nicest guy you'll ever meet.
He's

1468
01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:05.540
just start a war between those two.
Really Nice guys.
It's a mode of her draw.

1469
01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:07.930
It's like a shit about you.
Let's bring in the pope.
Try it.

1470
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:10.970
They'll do up this new pope.
Umea you might think he's pretty cool,

1471
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.770
but here's what he said about Gerard Carmichael.

1472
01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:19.010
It's hugs or fake motherfucker that he's got enough strength behind them.

1473
01:27:19.011 --> 01:27:22.680
Sits in that regular chair and as soon as the camera's goes off,
bring me my 12

1474
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:28.190
he's my example.
Somewhat of like a nice way to be.

1475
01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:31.880
Go out of your way to lock your door when he gets out of your car.
Well,

1476
01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:34.380
it's just,
he's one of those guys that you see me always want to hug him.
Yeah,

1477
01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.220
he's just a genuine sweetheart.
Here's a podcast house.

1478
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:41.990
Good Times with Steve Simone and especial cds just came into the,

1479
01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:44.720
Ooh,
remember the

1480
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:51.230
funny guy and the guy also homegrown,
homegrown comedy store veteran.

1481
01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:54.110
That's,
yeah,
it was teach Simone started there.

1482
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.430
Started it might've done a few sets out to get out of that.

1483
01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.180
You would fill in and came,
but like only a few.
Yeah,
not much.

1484
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.500
He grew up in front of us.
You know,
he was the manager that he worked there.

1485
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:06.860
Bunch to work there.
Yeah,
I'll put up vomit.
Oh,
he's a good dude.

1486
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.990
Always a good dude.
No matter what was going on.
Even a waste.

1487
01:28:09.991 --> 01:28:13.550
Suicidally depressed.
It was just nice to everyone.
Well,

1488
01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:15.950
you know when things weren't going as well as they are right now,

1489
01:28:15.951 --> 01:28:19.820
now he's doing great.
Like Steve Simone is starting to build momentum.
You know,

1490
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:23.430
I hear a lot of people talking about him.
I hear tweets like when he was a,
um,

1491
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:26.720
releasing his album,
we all retweeted his album and he,

1492
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.950
people were talking about a funny is this is a very,
a very loved guy.
Now,

1493
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.950
you know,
it's hard to get that connection.
And he's like,

1494
01:28:33.951 --> 01:28:38.870
the stories he tells on stage are so good.
Like he's like one of those guys,

1495
01:28:38.890 --> 01:28:42.740
a storyteller,
grads are like the best around at it.
I'm like,
fuck,

1496
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:46.940
well he's just a lovable dude.
Charismatic level dude.
Yeah.

1497
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.540
He didn't go to that style out of that battle like battle field of the company

1498
01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:54.260
is doing where he's like,
I'm going to be my thing.

1499
01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:58.700
I'm going to tell stories of childhood and fun times and beautiful things and I

1500
01:28:58.710 --> 01:29:01.590
can go out to some guy who was talking about going down in a girl during her

1501
01:29:01.591 --> 01:29:05.790
period,
like AAA and just fucking,
you know,
battling,

1502
01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:07.980
get some heckler and then he's going to be like,
well,

1503
01:29:07.981 --> 01:29:12.420
now we're going to reset and have a great time.
And it's so funny.
Ab.
Yeah,

1504
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:17.040
but that's like also Sebastian Sebastian,
another one.
He's clean dice.
Yeah.

1505
01:29:17.041 --> 01:29:18.830
I mean it's bashing.
It's like,
but he's hilarious.

1506
01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:22.140
Drake killer and his own super clean way.
Yup.

1507
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.520
And just like tearing apart like God,
you know,
messy.
We just talked about that.

1508
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.850
He thought he was shitting on that.
It's like he's against that too.
What was it?

1509
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:34.110
What was the topic with the topic?
I forgot what it was.
Uber.
Uber

1510
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:41.220
with Yelp.
That's what he said.
When a teacher with your phone,

1511
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.990
it's on everything.
It's a best God.
He's good.
Yeah.
I think that's what he said.

1512
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.510
Is Hiv hiking with your phone.
Yeah.
He's funny dude.

1513
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.020
I was alone in a hotel room and you saw the Sebastian special.

1514
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:54.750
It's special on showtime.
I think I was Texas.

1515
01:29:54.751 --> 01:29:58.350
I think it was doing standup at Texas and just flipped on showtime and I watched

1516
01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:01.860
the whole thing and I was laughing.
I really,
really enjoyed it.

1517
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:06.390
Like it was really fun.
He's great.
He's one of the best in the business.
Yeah.

1518
01:30:06.391 --> 01:30:07.320
It was cool to see though.

1519
01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:11.550
You know like cause again like to get past like Simone.
Yeah.

1520
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.150
I saw a guy get that.

1521
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.470
We're going to become a paid like a hole in the shell and got better.

1522
01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:17.790
Then be like,
okay,
you can stand on its own.

1523
01:30:17.791 --> 01:30:19.020
They start getting better and totally,

1524
01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:23.280
it was one of the best comics in the country.
Yeah,
yeah,
true.
That already.

1525
01:30:23.281 --> 01:30:25.470
That's just amazing.
I don't know who did digital.

1526
01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.380
I've got my wispy hair too and it's long.
That's how it gets.

1527
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:32.970
I'll whispery like that.
Such a good photo with Bono.
Who drew it?
Oh,
who do that?

1528
01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.930
I remember that.

1529
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.850
I don't know if somebody just posted on the message board and my long hair.

1530
01:30:37.851 --> 01:30:40.470
Why don't you uh,
asked whoever posted where they got it.

1531
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.130
Let's see if we can give that person credit.
The whole thing.
That's amazing.

1532
01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:48.810
This looks like you fucked.
Danieli.
Bolelli.
Really?
He just fucked each other.

1533
01:30:48.811 --> 01:30:53.400
Other's my balls was my pillow right there at the hot bout half,
half Jew,

1534
01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:58.560
half Guinea kid.
That's pretty good that I'm tired from doing morning radio.

1535
01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:03.000
That's how my hair looks like that.
And there's your shower.
Let it air dry.

1536
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.080
The morning radio thing when you're on the road.
That shit does get tires.

1537
01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:09.580
I'm doing it.
It's just cause you don't have a chance to sleep a full four.
Yeah.

1538
01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.880
You know,
it's like,
it's like you go to sleep,
it's like go to sleep.

1539
01:31:12.881 --> 01:31:15.570
Like I'm not tired of 10.
I was going to sleep at three 30 in the morning,

1540
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.780
the last three straight weeks at 10:00 PM.

1541
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:23.640
The guy from the message board actually drew it.
His name is,
uh,
Tom.

1542
01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:26.740
Uh,
so verb by put aside,

1543
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:32.970
oh,
over by Thomas Thomas overbuy probably.
Oh,
there you go.

1544
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:37.710
Tomas,
Tomas,
Tomas over by.
Wow.
He,
that's his own art.
Yeah.
Wow.

1545
01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:39.270
He did that while we're on the podcast.

1546
01:31:39.271 --> 01:31:41.910
He said that he started at the beginning of this podcast and know,

1547
01:31:41.911 --> 01:31:45.630
finish that right then it's probably been drawing as a child,

1548
01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.450
probably was vicious to me.

1549
01:31:48.451 --> 01:31:52.770
And then when they dedicated wall that's covered and yellow spackling saw the

1550
01:31:52.771 --> 01:31:55.960
dried come of as a Jack Hewlett rogue and he saw,

1551
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:59.590
he was like drawing face.
He says,
he says,

1552
01:31:59.591 --> 01:32:01.990
I drew this last year from Ari,
seven minutes.

1553
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:06.910
Shit sketch after failing horribly at a really drawing on us.

1554
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.640
Yeah.
It comes from a 30 frame comic called Ra should fear Shit.
Anal Lube.

1555
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.390
You Shit yourself and he fucks you.
It's a longer piece.

1556
01:32:19.391 --> 01:32:23.440
That's really,
it tells a lot about the world we live in.
It's changes,

1557
01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:27.520
it's meaning along the way.
Many times you got to stay along for the ride.

1558
01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:32.110
They get the full to get the full or just really,
really an aluminum me up.

1559
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:37.330
Really just bathing me in it Kerry takes and that really shows how a mother and

1560
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:40.750
child can really love each other.
There must be a guy out there somewhere.

1561
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.900
I mean if you know you were talking about how you tore your penis because of a

1562
01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:48.970
lack of lubrication.
That's not a regular thing I've done by the way.
Okay.

1563
01:32:48.971 --> 01:32:51.880
It just happens.
It's not a big deal.
I understand.
I'm not judging you at all,

1564
01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:56.380
but would like someone with the diarrhea that would probably be way more

1565
01:32:56.381 --> 01:32:58.660
lubrication than normal and more lubrication.

1566
01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.600
Plus the whole area would be super relaxed and all blown out.

1567
01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.240
You just diet out,

1568
01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:12.900
empty out a fucking big gulp of splattery diarrhea at that little bottle.

1569
01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:19.190
It's like process like seeds go on the aside.

1570
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:25.260
The ends of hot dogs to see him three times in Chinatown in San Francisco and I

1571
01:33:26.381 --> 01:33:27.970
was shitting out full noodles,

1572
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:32.860
legit full Moodle's like everybody's like,
no,
we're not.

1573
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:36.670
Dot leaves leaves.
I get at peppers but full noodles,

1574
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:40.130
they were like the flake that my finger long one on my leave.

1575
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:45.360
Your body's like,
I'm not buying it,
man.
I'm not fucking buy.

1576
01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:48.750
And they would call this food.
We do not call this food.
Why did they get it?
Like,

1577
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.910
look,
I am running this through all my fucking natural computers.

1578
01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:56.800
It's coming up negative.
Did you,
is this gutter oil?

1579
01:33:57.130 --> 01:34:01.670
Good oil?
They have that and in China town,
I don't know.
Made its way.

1580
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:03.700
I want to hear you hear the sound of it.
Plopping it.

1581
01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:06.070
You don't want to hear it man.
That the plopping sound.

1582
01:34:06.071 --> 01:34:07.480
I was like almost got you to a bar.

1583
01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.300
I believe Jamie is the second biggest fuck up.

1584
01:34:10.301 --> 01:34:14.950
We're not continuing to play that blowing.
Yeah,
it's dark,

1585
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:18.940
dark world.
Yeah,
and that's happening right now.
Somewhere in the world.

1586
01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:23.140
Someone's digging into a sewer and pulling out a big shovel full of shit and

1587
01:34:23.141 --> 01:34:26.950
buying it at the store.
Just doing this.
It's cheaper than buying it at the store.

1588
01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:30.070
So we'd save money by doing this and look at the House that I bought.

1589
01:34:30.071 --> 01:34:32.470
If it wasn't for God a royal,
I couldn't have bought a house.

1590
01:34:32.630 --> 01:34:36.880
That lady built an empire on gun oil empire.
This lady's like,

1591
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:41.080
she owns her house steep into that and the Republic of China.
Is that right?

1592
01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:47.590
Somewhere she thought,
well who knows what the fuck she actually said,

1593
01:34:47.591 --> 01:34:50.410
we're just reading what somebody translated.
Oh,
that's a great point.

1594
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.970
Talking to English at all.
Yeah,
we translations are terrible.
Oh,

1595
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:56.200
maybe they didn't say any of that.

1596
01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.110
She might've said I was about to lose my house and my children would have died

1597
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:04.130
and everyone would starve to death and they had to take shit oil.
Oh,

1598
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.350
eating it though.
People like a lot of people,

1599
01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:14.770
people I eat street food.
I didn't need street noodles though,
but eighth street,

1600
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.160
new food,
but he's in an oil that they cook in.

1601
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:20.383
Ah,

1602
01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:33.070
AH,
probably

1603
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:38.420
eat street food.
The meat was great.
You would just point at a thing.

1604
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:39.680
It would cause one yen,

1605
01:35:39.681 --> 01:35:43.190
which is about 16 cents and it was three or four pieces of a meat.

1606
01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.620
And I don't know how to pronounce any meat or how to say any of them.

1607
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:48.950
So I'm like,
I guess that this one of those please two of these.

1608
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:50.210
And if you ate it,
you didn't like it.

1609
01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:54.110
You just throw the thing out because it was 15 16 cents and the Ethan asks me

1610
01:35:54.111 --> 01:35:57.560
like,
this one tastes good.
What do you think it was?
Lamb,

1611
01:35:57.561 --> 01:36:01.160
chicken dogs,
male maybe.
Probably dog.

1612
01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:04.820
Great dog is more of a Korean thing they said is it said you could find it in

1613
01:36:04.821 --> 01:36:07.310
China,
but it's not like a really around much what the fuck.

1614
01:36:07.311 --> 01:36:10.390
But you know what I what it was maybe not one dog even more than I might've

1615
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.030
wanted that before.

1616
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:13.730
Just for the experience is you know how venison they got a clean,

1617
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:15.440
well you probably know this has got to kill it clean.

1618
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:18.350
Cause if it dumps the adrenaline going to kind of ruins the meat.

1619
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.260
It doesn't hurt that.
Yeah,

1620
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.640
it's kind of heard that as a theory I've heard is a theory,

1621
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:24.620
but I don't think it's quick dog me.
This is the opposite.

1622
01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:25.580
They want the adrenaline.

1623
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:30.230
So they beat on it for about two hours and smashed the cage and stuff.

1624
01:36:30.231 --> 01:36:34.640
No,
really?
Yeah.
And then kill it or tastier meeting.
I'm like,
well,

1625
01:36:34.641 --> 01:36:38.470
I'm out then.
Then I'm out and there's no way I'm only going to eat.
People meet.

1626
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.650
I'm skipping over dog.
There's no fucking way.
Wow.
Can I only eat racists?

1627
01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:46.780
This was a pure bred racist.
This guy thought you're racist,

1628
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:50.690
but some of these people were not.
I want a homophobe t-bone.
Yeah.

1629
01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.050
Really revenge or worthy cut.

1630
01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:59.690
What the fuck man?
What dog would you eat if you had to choose one?

1631
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:04.100
I'd get retriever golden too.
Sweet.
Fluffy.
No.

1632
01:37:04.101 --> 01:37:07.680
Those fucking slobber dogs.
Get them out of the way.
Every restaurant,

1633
01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:11.410
another restaurant of fancy restaurant.
Someone brought in a fucking,
uh,

1634
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.860
fancy festival shuttle support.

1635
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.140
A big fucking Labrador retriever sat down next to them at a table while they're

1636
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:22.520
eating.
You've,
you gotta be kidding me?
No,
it was clean dog.
Everybody brings in,

1637

Where if I'm America,

1639

We are America.
America.
We don't bring our dogs.

1640
01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.110
Sit down next to a brunch.
Yeah,

1641
01:37:39.111 --> 01:37:43.890

Dude,
I want to eat shit.
Well,
I want to,

1643
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:49.670
I'll tell you something worse.
Whoa.
How's that possible?

1644
01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:55.800
I was on big Jay's podcasts.
Legion of skanks is kind of the

1645
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:59.640
<v 4>morning zoo type thing.
They have fun anyway.</v>

1646
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:03.010
They've been opened up fan mail because they're getting started as a podcast or

1647
01:38:03.011 --> 01:38:04.380
super excited,
but the fan mail they got,

1648
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:07.500
they open it up on the air and they read it and they get sent stuff.

1649
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:11.670
One of the things that got sent was cookies,
sugar,
cookies.

1650
01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:14.730
We had all gotten high and I was like,
fuck it,
I can make that show cookie.

1651
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.080
And then uh,
Jay was like,
oh,
maybe you shouldn't need,

1652
01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:21.930
I mean that was just from a fan.
I wouldn't necessarily eat.
I'm like,

1653
01:38:21.931 --> 01:38:24.840
what's it going to be fucking weed cookie,
all the better.
Let's do this.

1654
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:26.780
And he's like,
no,
all wheat.

1655
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:31.770
We do like long segments about like we've done long segments about like coming

1656
01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:32.604
on food.

1657
01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:37.140
Like we have like a whole fight about it a few weeks ago.

1658
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:41.190
Like how you can come on food and,
and then like make people eat it.

1659
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.000
And then as a podcast,
when were,
we're like,
oh yeah,
I definitely,
yeah,
for sure.

1660
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.500
For sure.
It's
just a calm cookie.

1661
01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.630
That's not nice.
No,
it's not.
It was terrible.
I was getting more nauseous at went,

1662
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:58.650
but I was like,
yeah,
whatever happened in there.
And the edit podcasts you do,

1663
01:38:58.651 --> 01:39:02.370
you have like contest once drunk around the back of bets.

1664
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:07.470
Recently Josh Martin lost and you guys all had to come on a towel and he had to

1665
01:39:07.471 --> 01:39:11.070
wash his face with this task.
The same guy.
You half,
half,

1666
01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:15.320
half monkey restaurant.
Joe Rogan Guy.

1667
01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.710
The same guy.
Yeah.
Tomas overbuy.
Yeah.
Overbay dude,

1668
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:24.220
he's amazing artist.
Yeah,
Dude.
Yeah.
The bag of Beth's was of Sam.

1669
01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:26.220
Shelby came in the last two or as a fantasy league.

1670
01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:29.310
And not only do you not come in the final two,
he won the fantasy league,

1671
01:39:29.311 --> 01:39:31.330
so the loser has to take,
uh,

1672
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:37.190
we all have to Tj's onto a rag and then they have to use that as their morning.

1673
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:40.230
They have to re applied some moisture to reactivate.

1674
01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:44.590
Oh my God,
mark and wipe their face with it.

1675
01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:48.810
So were you allowed to wipe it off after you wipe your face?
Well yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1676
01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:50.220
But you got to wipe,
you can wipe it off.

1677
01:39:50.221 --> 01:39:52.980
You got to do a little bit of wiping and then you could wipe it off afterwards.

1678
01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:55.800
Yeah.
And how many days?
What do you mean how many days?

1679
01:39:55.801 --> 01:39:57.210
How many days you have to do this?
Just once.

1680
01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.810
Just to do it once but reapplied the Wa it's as if you know at the airport,

1681
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:03.840
at the planes like fresh towel and you're like,
oh we'd love that.
I'd love that.

1682
01:40:03.841 --> 01:40:06.630
And then it really get it in there.
Yet the peoples come,

1683
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:10.350
three peoples come three people's kind of cocky on the rag bag of bets.

1684
01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:14.550
I'm more sad to three people can come on a rag that easy.
It's that easy.

1685
01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.940
What is your kind of separate it?
We're not going to stand around it.

1686
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:19.410
The third guy,

1687
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:24.270
the third guy to come has a real issue.

1688
01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:29.250
The fact that he gets still shoot a load on the dying loads of his two friends

1689
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.060
who are,
who are you and what's getting you off like,
Eh,
eh?
How?

1690
01:40:35.061 --> 01:40:37.070
How much does he knuckling his asshole

1691
01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:43.110
thumb deepened his ass?
I'm going to get their vigorously moving it.

1692
01:40:43.111 --> 01:40:47.970
Just shaking it as fast
as Josh already done this,

1693
01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:51.000
that we're doing the awards ceremony,
the comedy store patio.

1694
01:40:51.001 --> 01:40:53.980
He's got to do it there in front of everybody.
Oh,
we have all

1695
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.150
<v 0>these backup bets.
They're great.</v>

1696
01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:58.480
They watch porn while they jerked off onto this thing or did you just jerk off

1697
01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:00.880
from it?
Just jerk off.
We just,
wherever we want to do,
it's up to us.

1698
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:03.070
Here's the rack.
Now you go.

1699
01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:06.370
We had this bet where me and Tebow bed on a round of golf.

1700
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.760
He was positive he could beat me and we put in there at loser has to watch every

1701
01:41:09.761 --> 01:41:10.594
episode of Whitney

1702
01:41:16.190 --> 01:41:20.660
in a row.
Write a book,
report about it in a raw.
Yeah,
I have to do what?

1703
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.850
[inaudible] boy,
you have one day off in between seasons.
Oh,
Cuba.

1704
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:28.000
I didn't get it right.
Yeah.
To Whitney Cummings has is fine.

1705
01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.760
I don't want to tell you what the bid is about.
I want to give up any of it,

1706
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:32.580
but it was a murderous bit really.

1707
01:41:32.690 --> 01:41:36.130
She's got this bid that I've watched grow over like the last like three or four

1708
01:41:36.131 --> 01:41:40.900
weeks.
It's murderous,
dude.
She's been doing a lot of standup.

1709
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.400
It's really interesting to see someone just really like catch momentum really

1710
01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:48.760
just like you see a bit and if she keeps working there no reason why she can't

1711
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:51.820
pick him up.
Really,
really like great comic.
Yeah,
no doubt.

1712
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:52.720
I mean you get the opportunity.

1713
01:41:52.721 --> 01:41:54.910
All of these people that get the opportunity like we'll get you up.

1714
01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:57.940
They usually just stop doing comedy.
Yeah,
no,
she does a lot.

1715
01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:00.850
She's always on stair,
on stage at the store.

1716
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:03.790
I followed the store like three or four times in a row.

1717
01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:07.450
I've seen what the Improv all the time that check puts in work.

1718
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:09.280
I respect the shit out of her.

1719
01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.130
She is always doing standup and she's always like tweaking stuff and adding this

1720
01:42:14.131 --> 01:42:18.850
stuff and changing stuff.
She takes chances.
She writes a lot.
She moves forward.

1721
01:42:18.970 --> 01:42:23.380
It's the Whitney model.
I tell everybody about who forward you go do something.

1722
01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:26.890
Well this podcast might just do it anyway,
then it won't go anywhere to do it.

1723
01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.050
What do you do?
Lost nothing.
The time you are doing nothing.
Move forward.
Yeah,

1724
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:34.960
right a bit.
She's makes a short sketch.
Do something.
Just go,

1725
01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.860
she's a super likable person too,
like in real life and he talked to her.

1726
01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:42.730
She's really friendly,
you know,
so it's like you want her to,

1727
01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:47.460
you want her to be really good,
you know,
and that she's like,
she's,

1728
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:51.330
I'll tell you off the air what this bit is cause I don't want to give up what

1729
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:54.910
the topic of the bit.
It's God damn.
It's hilarious.
It's just funny man.

1730
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.410
This is a good time,
dude.

1731
01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.610
I've been seeing so many funny guys that I didn't even know were around at the

1732
01:43:00.611 --> 01:43:03.400
store recently.
I got to start remembering people's names.

1733
01:43:03.401 --> 01:43:08.290
Santina know Theo Vaughn is really funny,
but you know what's the pasta?

1734
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:11.840
This is the hidden Joran is the hidden gem of the game.

1735
01:43:11.841 --> 01:43:16.540
Man Wars gray going to bluff.
This is the history of the comedy store.

1736
01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:21.720
It's the late nights sets with either Brian Holtzman or Brody Stevens.

1737
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:25.600
I have seen them for the past couple weeks.

1738
01:43:25.630 --> 01:43:29.860
I've stuck around and the last guy on stage in the main room does it as long as

1739
01:43:29.861 --> 01:43:34.030
they want and a lot of times they go on stage somewhere before 1:00 AM and they

1740
01:43:34.031 --> 01:43:36.540
have an hour if they want to.
They can go all the way to 2:00 AM.

1741
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:40.930
It was anywhere between 60 and four people in the room,
so the show starts out,

1742
01:43:40.931 --> 01:43:42.990
there's 300 plus people,
places mobbed.

1743
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.500
Everybody goes up crystally it kills bump it up and then it gets to the end and

1744
01:43:47.501 --> 01:43:51.740
then Brody Stevens goes up and Brody Stevens made,
I was fucking,

1745
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:56.650
I was hyperventilating,
crying,
laughing,
and slapping the table,

1746
01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:03.260
watching you don't laugh.
I push,
I push.

1747
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:04.190
You know who I am.

1748
01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:10.970
I push to those late.
Where'd you go to school?
He'll tell you.

1749
01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:13.460
They'll tell you where he went to school,
anywhere in southern California,

1750
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:14.210
anywhere.

1751
01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:17.260
He will tell you a major league baseball player who went there and they go,

1752
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:21.680
I know him.
You're going to treat me like that.
I went to,

1753
01:44:21.681 --> 01:44:24.590
I'm friends with your bureau.
Highest honored person.

1754
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:28.670
Arizona state alumni.
Two and one.

1755
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:34.840
I always like shit on us up a little bit at the end.
Joe,

1756
01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:40.140
can you picture joked during the big game on lemme make golf.

1757
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:45.740
It fucks with my body temperature.
So lofting 40 for me.

1758
01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:46.970
I had to move on.

1759
01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:52.550
I'd like to get off the meds.
He's fucking awesome.

1760
01:44:52.551 --> 01:44:57.290
His late night show the other night,
it was not this past Friday night,

1761
01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:01.600
but the one before Mike.
God Man,
I was in awe.
He's well,

1762
01:45:01.601 --> 01:45:04.850
he's been doing so many warm ups,
you know,
he does warm up so much.

1763
01:45:04.851 --> 01:45:09.380
He's constantly used to just completely ad living in front of like this group of

1764
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:11.990
people that's waiting for a television show to be for.
So there's like,

1765
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.650
they'll fail my sag bad.
They'll,
they'll,
all right audience has to clap now.

1766
01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:19.730
And in between that,
what is setting things up a lot of shows.

1767
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.090
I got there early and watch him.
It was like,
I just want to see you bro.

1768
01:45:22.091 --> 01:45:25.500
You're fantastic at it.
But when when he's so fantastic at,

1769
01:45:25.501 --> 01:45:29.570
and one of the things he does is he has this incredible ability to make comedy

1770
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:34.430
out of it.
Nothing.
Anything that's going on like he's completely free.
Like he,

1771
01:45:34.431 --> 01:45:38.750
his,
his ability to ad Lib is like no ones like his ability to like move into the

1772
01:45:38.751 --> 01:45:42.920
crowd and just start bringing everybody together and polling like little,

1773
01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:45.200
little things that he said to this person,
to that person.

1774
01:45:45.201 --> 01:45:48.050
Like he's so used to being free when he's doing those,

1775
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.550
those warm up things like constantly on,
just for free flowing back and forth.

1776
01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:56.690
Stayed at gathering people.
We're working here,
we're pushing it.

1777
01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.590
I push,
I'm from the valley.
Okay,

1778
01:46:00.591 --> 01:46:02.750
eight one eight till I die,
you know?

1779
01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:06.860
But he can do that in that rhythm with that sort of,
he's good.

1780
01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.190
He's in Jujitsu.
Wrong guys are the Rah Rah Rah or they just can't do,

1781
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:14.570
can't do the warmup did.
He's a monster.
He was murdering the other night.

1782
01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.620
I mean fucking murder.

1783
01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:17.620
<v 7>This is something that Eddie found the other day.
Eddie,</v>

1784
01:46:17.630 --> 01:46:22.630
if this is what Brody used to send out to managers and comedy clubs and stuff

1785
01:46:22.991 --> 01:46:27.730
like that,
and it's a VHS tape,
the human 27 years of experience.
Trust me,

1786
01:46:27.731 --> 01:46:28.990
I understand comedy,

1787
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:38.090
<v 0>your friend,
the picture.
He's so awesome.
I'm such a huge Brody fan.
Yeah,</v>

1788
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.781
that's fun.

1789
01:46:38.781 --> 01:46:41.900
Especially when you're stoned and then you just like go in there and just laugh

1790
01:46:41.901 --> 01:46:44.700
and the crowds like half full,
so it's like,
oh,
this is great.
Yeah,

1791
01:46:44.850 --> 01:46:48.140
Holtzman almost how me Barf once I was laughing so hard,
I was almost like,

1792
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:52.420
it was like the only that Jack outs to where I was like,
ha ha,

1793
01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:56.010
just couldn't barely hold it.
Those two guys,

1794
01:46:56.011 --> 01:46:58.080
if you ever see them on the lineup at the comedy store,

1795
01:46:58.081 --> 01:47:02.070
please go for the late night aspect to that.
I mean go for the whole show,

1796
01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:05.430
but stick around to the end.
Here's where,
here's where the story gets cool.

1797
01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:08.640
It's actually when you're out,
you're done out,
you're finished,
you're drunk,

1798
01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:12.090
midnight.
Should we go home?
It's like no midnights too.

1799
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.910
It's just kind of raw jazzy environment.
The store.

1800
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:16.650
So just heading to the store and sober up there.

1801
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.560
The almost probably let you in for free.
Almost always,

1802
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.080
unless it's still packed on a weekend or something.

1803
01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:24.930
Last night there was $1 million car there.
Right?
Parked.
Yeah.

1804
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:29.850
Porsche fucking testers.
Porsche nine 18 they were testing it.

1805
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:31.500
It felt like a man for sure.

1806
01:47:31.501 --> 01:47:34.590
Guys with Porsche jackets and there was a car ahead of them.

1807
01:47:34.591 --> 01:47:38.060
Two of the Porsche has a nice Porsche.
Yeah.
Oh,
I wonder if they like work.

1808
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.790
I think it was a prototype.
Well No,
it's,
it's,
it's a cards available.

1809
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:46.440
It's called a nine 18 it's this incredible car,
that $875,000 sticker value.

1810
01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:49.590
Yeah.
And that's if you can get one they're all spoken for.

1811
01:47:49.591 --> 01:47:52.010
So you'd have to pay some sober.
A male.
Yeah.

1812
01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.300
It probably have to pay over a million dollars.
Wow.

1813
01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.900
And it'd be worth it to like parked at a meter on sunset.
That's incredible.

1814
01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:02.930
That's $1 million.
I touched it while people are texting with my shit,
right?
Yeah.

1815
01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.780
People are texting and barely paying attention.
All right now.

1816
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:11.460
And this car is parked on the side right there.
I was there that someone's like,

1817
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:15.600
Hey,
look at that car.
We're like,
oh yeah.
Well I saw a VA run once in Hollywood,

1818
01:48:15.601 --> 01:48:19.100
which is even more expensive.
A big Gotti.
We've got Eva Braun Real,

1819
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.350
I just want to be one of the fastest cars in the world is big giant spaceship

1820
01:48:22.351 --> 01:48:25.320
looking thing and that's more than a million.
Wow.

1821
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:27.690
It's like a million and a half or something crazy there.
It is.

1822
01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:32.620
He only thing is like when they opened the doors I was really expecting door

1823
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:35.190
thing that we like,
like go back and then up or something.

1824
01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.180
Babies just like this little regular door today.
What Porsche is like?

1825
01:48:39.230 --> 01:48:40.410
They're the best.

1826
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.450
They're the best designers in terms of like the right compromise between like

1827
01:48:45.630 --> 01:48:50.630
ridiculous speed and power and handling and also like efficiency.

1828
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.060
It's a hybrid car.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's also just the way they,

1829
01:48:56.061 --> 01:48:58.380
they don't make things that are too extravagant.

1830
01:48:58.381 --> 01:49:01.500
They don't make like from their Lamborghini coon Tashas,
you know,

1831
01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:05.610
they're like this big ridiculous fibery than cars.
Like they,
if they make a car,

1832
01:49:05.611 --> 01:49:08.490
like the width,
it all,
it's all about the engineering of the car.

1833
01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.590
It's like how fast can we get this car?

1834
01:49:10.591 --> 01:49:13.590
Like what is the best way to the road if they're making something like this.

1835
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:17.660
But it's interesting because they're stuck with this nine 11 and that's the,
the,

1836
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:19.560
the car that has the engine in the back.

1837
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:21.780
It's like really not the best way to do it.

1838
01:49:21.781 --> 01:49:24.290
Like you're not really supposed to have an engine in the back.
It's like it's,

1839
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.440
it becomes unbalanced.

1840
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:29.940
It swings back and forth to widely guys because they started out doing it that

1841
01:49:29.941 --> 01:49:32.250
way back when they didn't know any better than that 11 yeah.

1842
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:35.560
And then they've sort of stuck with it because it's kind of like a

1843
01:49:35.561 --> 01:49:37.410
characteristic of the nine 11

1844
01:49:39.190 --> 01:49:43.000
is this the kind of card that Paul Walker died in like this kind of like here's

1845
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:45.780
was no more horsepower,

1846
01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:50.380
but his was a Carrera and the issue with Paul Walker's car,
everybody's like,

1847
01:49:50.381 --> 01:49:54.160
well,
the car was like really dangerous.
Like no,
it was not that dangerous.

1848
01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.630
According to everybody that I've talked to.

1849
01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:58.840
That's a car expert and is not coming from me.
This is Chris Harris told me,

1850
01:49:58.841 --> 01:50:03.400
Matt Farah told me the real issue was that the car itself had been on the same

1851
01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:06.430
tires for a long time,
like seven,

1852
01:50:06.431 --> 01:50:08.500
eight years and then they go,

1853
01:50:08.501 --> 01:50:12.610
they get hard and they have no grip and you have an amazing horsepower and

1854
01:50:12.611 --> 01:50:16.630
you're treating the car is if it's like a car with like current tires,

1855
01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.800
car tires actually harden and dry up.

1856
01:50:21.210 --> 01:50:23.250
<v 3>Oh seniors in here.
When you're saying that though,</v>

1857
01:50:23.251 --> 01:50:27.510
you sound like the guys who were defending pitbulls and like the 80s it's not,

1858
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.353
but it's

1859
01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:32.750
<v 0>no like high horsepower cars.
Like it's a really high horsepower car.
Yeah,</v>

1860
01:50:32.890 --> 01:50:35.840
but it's not so high horsepower that it'd be dangerous.
Right.

1861
01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:38.350
You know like I drove a car,
it was dangerous.

1862
01:50:38.351 --> 01:50:40.430
I just heard it just was going on with you about and cracker and it's hard to

1863
01:50:40.431 --> 01:50:43.770
drive keep people who have crashed it.
What's a mid engine car?
It's,
it's,

1864
01:50:43.771 --> 01:50:48.110
it's got a really good balance but it's really powerful race car driver and so

1865
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:52.720
fast and it doesn't have the same sort of like traction based technology that

1866
01:50:52.721 --> 01:50:54.790
they have in in 2015.

1867
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:58.690
We have these weird like traction control like computers built in.

1868
01:50:58.691 --> 01:51:02.830
They know in one tire is like losing traction to compensate with the other side.

1869
01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:06.880
They break on one side to keep things moving at his old phone.
I know.

1870
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:09.780
It's amazing.
You don't even have Bluetooth in your car and I just signed up.

1871
01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:11.200
This has Bluetooth.
I don't have a car.

1872
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:15.130
Are you should fear for folks who don't know what we're talking about has gone

1873
01:51:15.131 --> 01:51:19.990
completely back to the flip phone.
I like it.
Pros and cons.
Okay.

1874
01:51:20.190 --> 01:51:21.460
The pros,
pros,

1875
01:51:21.930 --> 01:51:26.610
<v 3>they're few and far between.
Uh,</v>

1876
01:51:26.670 --> 01:51:30.060
one pro is I have to uh,
charge it every three and a half days.

1877
01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:34.650
Obviously.
The reason why is because you can't do anything worth trading it for,

1878
01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:37.860
but undeniable pro,
you don't have to charge it.
That's great

1879
01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:43.590
too.
You can do ignore without saying no on.

1880
01:51:43.591 --> 01:51:45.180
Somebody's remember that on no phones.

1881
01:51:45.181 --> 01:51:49.540
We could just stop the ringer without saying off the iPhone.
Never did.
Right.

1882
01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:52.030
They finally got that.
Oh yeah,
I've had it for awhile.

1883
01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:55.740
He just hit the volume button down or up and that'll just silence and then keep

1884
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:58.530
bringing up.
You can't set it stop ringing but not,
yeah,
you can get,

1885
01:51:58.531 --> 01:51:59.400
go back to what you're doing.

1886
01:51:59.401 --> 01:52:02.040
You have to like wait for it to finish ringing right before you can go back to

1887
01:52:02.041 --> 01:52:06.330
your texts and shit.
Ah,
yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
Like as far as declining it,

1888
01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:10.620
just way you want it and want to attend that.
You're not ignoring that call.

1889
01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:12.920
You just sit there,
stop pretending.

1890
01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:16.380
Stop pretending like I'm doing something I just said and I don't feel,

1891
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:19.710
I know I do not get upset when people send me to voicemail.
Really?
You're like,

1892
01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:22.380
oh you were doing so please send me to voicemail for a goof.

1893
01:52:22.530 --> 01:52:24.810
I can't wait to send you to voicemail now,

1894
01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:26.640
but if you let me tell you this right now,

1895
01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:28.590
for every time you send me to voicemail,

1896
01:52:28.710 --> 01:52:32.820
send me another time to voicemail and avoid sending Joey Diaz to voicemail cause

1897
01:52:32.821 --> 01:52:35.520
he will burn your soul.
I can't talk right now.
I'm getting married.

1898
01:52:35.521 --> 01:52:37.920
I'll talk to you later.
Okay.
Bye.
Yeah,
you can't do that.
You gotta answer.

1899
01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.230
You got to talk to him now the now the cons,

1900
01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:44.640
they cock sock off voicemail,
right?
What are you been all day?
I don't know man.

1901
01:52:44.641 --> 01:52:45.930
It's been 30 minutes.
Relax.

1902
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:49.520
<v 4>11:00 AM has that camera.
That camera has to be amazing.
It's great man.</v>

1903
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:53.270
It's over one Mexico megapixel 1.3 I don't even use the camera.

1904
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:55.820
And when I get text messages that have picture messages,

1905
01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.090
if it's any like look at this bed I made on a fight or something,

1906
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:03.260
I have to forward that to my email and look at it on a computer cause I'm just

1907
01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:05.060
not,
I just can't see it.
Oh Shit.

1908
01:53:05.061 --> 01:53:08.630
And then you have to do it forwarding on your computer too from your phone,

1909
01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:09.081
your computer.

1910
01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:14.081
You have to do that all by pressing like individual buttons to t I need to hit

1911
01:53:15.291 --> 01:53:16.700
an s or to hit the number seven.

1912
01:53:16.701 --> 01:53:19.130
You've got to go 10 times because you're going to overpass the first time.

1913
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.420
I forgot about that.

1914
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:24.080
I think it doesn't get messages also cause I think I've sent you step up before

1915
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:28.820
and you'd probably just never received.
Well you probably have that hair,

1916
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:32.450
Sam shovel.
It just sent me up.
Just send me a picture.
Let's do you enjoy that?

1917
01:53:33.130 --> 01:53:36.890
That's access for the people listening.
It's about 40 pixels.

1918
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:41.160
I don't even know what it is.
It's like a,
Oh my God.
No what it is.

1919
01:53:41.161 --> 01:53:45.950
That could be anything.
My God.
Is it like times square or is it a funeral?

1920
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.020
Was He made sure?
Hey,
I only answer if landed now.
Ari,

1921
01:53:51.021 --> 01:53:53.390
is it annoying though?
Like if you're driving or like,
shit,

1922
01:53:53.391 --> 01:53:56.090
I'm fucking net after Ohio state won the game,

1923
01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:59.300
Josh Barnett at Ohio state with a game.
Maybe.
I don't know what,

1924
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:03.740
but like if you're driving somewhere late at night,
you're lost.
God gone.
Okay.

1925
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:06.890
Also.
So,
yeah,
can't no GPS.
That's terrible.

1926
01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.520
But I already have found two new train routes that I didn't really know it would

1927
01:54:10.521 --> 01:54:12.770
work perfectly for the in the,

1928
01:54:12.771 --> 01:54:14.930
in the six days I was off at in New York I was like,

1929
01:54:14.931 --> 01:54:18.440
oh the six train goes between here and here.
I don't like to just take this.

1930
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:21.650
You know they have the APP that tells you that on Google tells you what it tells

1931
01:54:21.651 --> 01:54:23.990
you.
But it never tells me that the second drain and it's right there,

1932
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.273
it shows you.

1933
01:54:25.410 --> 01:54:28.940
It didn't tell me that I've been there for a while and it would never show me

1934
01:54:28.941 --> 01:54:31.390
that.
And I'm like,
oh I can take this.
I don't understand.
Oh this one can.

1935
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.070
I can like understand the map better cause you have to look and see what

1936
01:54:34.071 --> 01:54:36.020
connects to what.
So when you missed your train,

1937
01:54:36.021 --> 01:54:38.360
if you stop and tie your shoes and missed the one train and you can't get a

1938
01:54:38.361 --> 01:54:41.540
signal underground instead of being fucked like what's drink,
I took it like,

1939
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.760
oh well any of these are the end,
the queue.

1940
01:54:43.761 --> 01:54:46.490
These all go there and you can figure it out by learning the maps,

1941
01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.730
which you don't do when you have it on your phone at all times.

1942
01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:52.940
Sound recorder for you know,
existing.
Nope.
I have to open it up.

1943
01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.110
Keep it in my pocket open because we've closed it has done.

1944
01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.780
So you're going to go back to,
and you're gonna get an iPhone six tonight.

1945
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.960
Gold one.
No,
I'm not.
I'm,
I'm way more present.

1946
01:55:03.130 --> 01:55:07.910
I'm more social instantly.
I look at my surroundings more.

1947
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:13.430
That part is all carried on forward.
Carry forward as is and a,

1948
01:55:13.431 --> 01:55:16.190
trust me right now is the worst time for me to do this.
Why is that?

1949
01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.830
Because I've got a special,
I'm trying to promote coming up Friday,

1950
01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.720
Tom RingCentral at midnight.
I've got my storytellers,

1951
01:55:21.721 --> 01:55:24.500
when you call it coming out a week from Thursday,
that's starting.

1952
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:28.340
Why don't you make a statement out there to all the techno files and perhaps

1953
01:55:28.450 --> 01:55:31.450
tech note junkies,
shall we say?
Well,
I don't know.

1954
01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:32.540
People said they couldn't live without it,

1955
01:55:32.541 --> 01:55:36.410
but it's like this is what we lived at seven years ago.
You can't live without.

1956
01:55:36.411 --> 01:55:40.550
You can't possibly live without you,
but you'd live with seven years ago.

1957
01:55:40.551 --> 01:55:43.860
Like your life has been enriched by abandoning the smartphone.
Yeah,
a little bit.

1958
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.990
Really.
Here's the deal.
We haven't tested it yet.

1959
01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:47.670
We haven't tested what the etiquette is.

1960
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:49.950
The only reason people don't text while they drive anymore because they had to

1961
01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:53.100
make a law against it.
Otherwise people just would.

1962
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:55.980
So the idea that everyone will control it the right amount of time.

1963
01:55:55.981 --> 01:55:59.700
It's sort of ridiculous.
They won't,
they've proven not to.
The,

1964
01:55:59.701 --> 01:56:04.050
the battery on the iPhone three was minuscule compared to what the iPhone six is

1965
01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:07.290
and it lasts the same amount of time cause we're on the phone way more.

1966
01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.340
I was going to say that you,
you should have like a phone,

1967
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:14.970
like a regular phone and then an iPhone to do like social media type shit.
Yeah,

1968
01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:15.804
like an Ipod.

1969
01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:18.600
Then the problem is two hours in bed every morning before you get out of bed.

1970
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:22.320
That's your issue.
Right.
Sucked into the,
you get sucked in and people say,

1971
01:56:22.321 --> 01:56:26.940
well just don't use it.
Well since five years come back to us.
We have apps.

1972
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.570
I get it.
Yeah,
it's great.
It's,
they're great.
They're great.
I think too much.

1973
01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:33.130
I think for your [inaudible] you need it.
No,

1974
01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:35.340
you would just say you need I tweet from my phone.

1975
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:39.660
I can Instagram from my computer.
You say you need it,
but do you need me?

1976
01:56:39.661 --> 01:56:42.530
You can Instagram from your computer.
I didn't know you could do that.

1977
01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.750
Oh that's interesting.
I want to use the web browser.

1978
01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:50.160
Then you can like change shit on computers and stuff you can't through like on

1979
01:56:50.161 --> 01:56:52.980
your phone and then like update it right there.
Put memes and yourself

1980
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:59.480
Janky down.
Yeah.
No you would like that anyway,
but,
but like,
uh,

1981
01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:05.130
I just don't,
you just don't trust yourself.
And I was my seed on elevators.

1982
01:57:05.131 --> 01:57:07.140
The door's closed.
Everyone gets out like that and you don't,

1983
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:09.930
people don't get to look at each other.
I walked on the street in New York,

1984
01:57:09.931 --> 01:57:13.200
I go 10 blocks and one of the most exciting cities in the world and I haven't

1985
01:57:13.201 --> 01:57:17.550
looked at my surroundings at all.
I just haven't even had any new input.

1986
01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.580
And you get connected with everyone.
There is that,

1987
01:57:20.581 --> 01:57:24.060
but you're connected really with the circle.
You're already in friendship wise,

1988
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.600
so then you don't make new connections.
You're like,
yeah,

1989
01:57:27.601 --> 01:57:28.650
I can connect with this friend.

1990
01:57:28.651 --> 01:57:32.340
I'll tell him how he is on Facebook or on or whatever on text and then just no

1991
01:57:32.341 --> 01:57:35.700
reason.
Their body doesn't make you like say,
Oh hey,
you written that book.

1992
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:39.270
I read that.
It's a good book.
Everyone just shuts in.
They just go to their phone,

1993
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:42.410
kept bother somebody on the phone.
Similar.

1994
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:46.920
Dana White's just going like right out Dana White,
this mean I knew a tail,

1995
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:49.050
she was a flip phone and I was like,
well that makes sense.

1996
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:52.620
But then Louie was like,
yeah,
I went to one or two.
I was like,
no way.
Really.

1997
01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:54.120
I mean,
you've got a lot of shit going on.

1998
01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.640
And then when I found out Dana white flip phone,

1999
01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:59.030
I found out Dana White did it too.
And I'm like,
God damn,

2000
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:02.560
you know why has never moved from a flip phone?
Dana white is so good,

2001
01:58:02.561 --> 01:58:05.100
but his flip phone,
he could send you a message while looking right in your eyes.

2002
01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:09.030
He knows exactly what buttons to press.
He said all sorts of people are doing it.

2003
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:12.600
I asked him about,
he said all sorts of people are doing it.
Wow.

2004
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:16.020
That he's like more and more like,
like people that are like winning in life,

2005
01:58:16.021 --> 01:58:20.130
like doing shit.
This is how easily influenced I am.
I'm ready to switch.
I mean,

2006
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.950
here's the deal.
This is growing pains,
those growing pains.

2007
01:58:22.951 --> 01:58:24.090
The first day you're like,
ah,
I need it,

2008
01:58:24.091 --> 01:58:26.700
but that's what happens when you quit caffeine.
You're fucking,
you got headaches.

2009
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:30.360
Fascinating.
I think if you have an iPad mini,
it's totally do that.

2010
01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.090
The reason it seems like,
I think if you have a 42 inch screen,
it's on a wheel or

2011
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:40.800
handlebars.
Why think nowadays great snapchat,
half of them is just to get laid.

2012
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:44.460
Half those things are just like instruments of sex,
GPS,
the area.

2013
01:58:46.670 --> 01:58:49.070
It's true.
I mean the reason I have a Facebook fan page at all,

2014
01:58:49.071 --> 01:58:52.330
it's because some woman wrote me that once my on their Watson pretty much laid

2015
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:54.850
it out there.
She wanted to hook up and I was like,
damn it,
and I missed it.

2016
01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.430
It's already gone from the city.
Then I check it every two days.

2017
01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:02.080
We won't go without checking it again because of that one time.
All right.

2018
01:59:02.081 --> 01:59:06.050
It's going to be okay anyway.
It's been pretty cool.
I'm okay with it.

2019
01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.420
She just sits wrong.
Weird.
Uber's tough.
You can only Uber away.
Can't over back.

2020
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:13.860
So in a city like this where I don't have a car,
what I'll make them.

2021
01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.430
You can only take the bus for the first time.

2022
01:59:15.431 --> 01:59:18.920
Does that mean we're from my computer?
Oh.
And then getting back home,

2023
01:59:18.921 --> 01:59:21.280
it was difficult and you can't get back up to what?
From the,

2024
01:59:21.281 --> 01:59:24.010
where took the bus from the,
from the,
um,
from the doctor's office.

2025
01:59:24.011 --> 01:59:27.580
What the fuck are you saying to me?
You took all his clothes here.
I just looked,

2026
01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:30.580
I was like,
oh,
that goes right by the prevalence or regular bus in Los Angeles,

2027
01:59:30.581 --> 01:59:34.540
California.
I take it twice.
First of all,
the first time there was like domestic.

2028
01:59:34.541 --> 01:59:37.930
It's first time there was two black people.
There was a fucking,

2029
01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:42.910
a couple from Australia to white people and maybe like six or seven Mexicans.

2030
01:59:42.911 --> 01:59:45.490
But most of other people too,
and then the second time I took it,

2031
01:59:45.491 --> 01:59:48.130
they were full on homeless people on that.
It was pretty disgusting.

2032
01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:53.050
Tinder's probably impossible.
Tinder is being asked,
but it's hinder.

2033
01:59:53.051 --> 01:59:54.940
I'd delete it from my phone nine times anyway,

2034
01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:59.450
I've already taken I too much with world of Warcraft.
I'm like,
I can't anymore.

2035
01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:00.490
We're not getting nothing out of it.

2036
02:00:00.490 --> 02:00:03.880
I'll delete it and then like a month later I'm like,
Oh,
you just did the Tinder.

2037
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:08.120
Don't do,
they don't have any apps that really limit your app use and don't do.

2038
02:00:08.121 --> 02:00:08.980
They don't know.

2039
02:00:08.981 --> 02:00:12.700
They have apps that tell you you're at your two hours and you're like,
ignore.

2040
02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:15.400
Keep going.
Well,
you can always shut it off.
All right.

2041
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:18.180
[inaudible] your settings and say,
fuck you.

2042
02:00:18.181 --> 02:00:21.040
You could only double tap on that bottom button.
Delete those bitches,

2043
02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:24.220
but then you just read,
get them immediately maybe.
What do you mean?

2044
02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:28.450
That's so easy to do when you learn how to have a little discipline in your
life.

2045
02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:31.120
Absolutely are not.
Stop blaming it on an iPhone.

2046
02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:35.210
I got rid of cable for the same reason 10 years ago.
Again,

2047
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:39.370
I'm not wrong.
Cable boy was no,
it's better for cable.

2048
02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:43.120
It's better to have cabled and did not have cable.
Okay?

2049
02:00:43.121 --> 02:00:45.340
You don't have to watch cable.
If you have cable.

2050
02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.390
I do have to constantly be glued to the fucking television.
God.
It's a sickness.

2051
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:54.100
It's always on.
You can get away from Brian.
Come on.
Can't do that.

2052
02:00:54.101 --> 02:00:56.440
That's ruining Tinder.
Now girls don't see it as a real match.

2053
02:00:56.441 --> 02:00:58.540
We actually do math because you're a fucking idiot.
You're just like,

2054
02:00:58.541 --> 02:01:01.120
like liking all day.
It should be something special.

2055
02:01:01.121 --> 02:01:02.950
Then once you do like each other,
now they're like,
wow,

2056
02:01:02.951 --> 02:01:04.030
this guy's interested in me.
Now.

2057
02:01:04.031 --> 02:01:07.660
They don't even know that because your view guys that are always liking

2058
02:01:07.661 --> 02:01:10.120
everything,
you and Pete Davidson and all of these guys

2059
02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:15.790
like like like like a little class with it.
Nope,

2060
02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:18.310
it's a fuck site.
Just have a little bit of class if we can.

2061
02:01:18.311 --> 02:01:22.510
I'll have a nice fuck site.
You're ruining it with your fucking lack of patients.

2062
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:26.170
Is he ruling it?
Talking about it right now.
Now it's a great site,

2063
02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:28.450
but is it part of the ground that's ruining and talking about it?

2064
02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.610
Is it ruining it and talking about it did way more damage than I did because he

2065
02:01:32.611 --> 02:01:36.940
just wiping night people that that benefit just excepting everybody is,

2066
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:38.260
it's more a better odds.

2067
02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.530
What do you do when you're sticking it right in front of our face?

2068
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.850
What are you talking about?
You were interrupting the conversation.

2069
02:01:43.851 --> 02:01:47.240
It's showing this all this.
Blame it on me.
I wouldn't even brought,
yeah,

2070
02:01:47.241 --> 02:01:51.830
I would dare you.
How dare you?
I love what you're going to hear.
A laugh.

2071
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:55.160
And when someone knows they've been like,
oh yeah,
good point.
I kind of laugh.

2072
02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.820
It's like,
but my point was just trying to show you that you can't do Tinder.

2073
02:01:58.821 --> 02:02:02.120
Like how,
I mean there's,
there has to be so many things that you are action.

2074
02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.570
I'm so addicted to Tinder is one of the best examples of why I should not have a

2075
02:02:05.571 --> 02:02:10.400
phone.
It's garbage.
It's awful.
It takes all your time.
All right.

2076
02:02:10.401 --> 02:02:14.630
What if something crazy happens?
Like,
you know,
like terrorists.
Let's see,

2077
02:02:14.631 --> 02:02:17.240
let's talk about it.
And you are like,

2078
02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:21.170
you know walking in a park and you hear all these explosions,
people screaming,

2079
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:25.430
you go to your phone and your what?
Your text based.

2080
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:27.470
I don't know if was going to go to their phone.
Someone's going to be like,

2081
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:31.280
it's the fucking terrorists.
They separate that way.
Okay,

2082
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:35.660
you probably checked your phone rubbed that way you say,
fine,

2083
02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:38.690
I'm not going to wait and fucking it turns your mind so I fucking search engine

2084
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:41.360
will.
You will be so easy.
Everybody does.
When they show brought their apps,

2085
02:02:41.361 --> 02:02:42.830
if I was like,
no,
let me do it on my app.

2086
02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:47.660
Let me get the Google search so easy to deceive.
I'll go down fast.

2087
02:02:47.661 --> 02:02:50.300
That's going to get the pull up the wrong website that just stick sticking in

2088
02:02:50.301 --> 02:02:54.500
your face.
It's going to be one of those like onion type website Snopes.
It

2089
02:02:56.110 --> 02:03:00.980
are running.
You're running.
There's no dragons.

2090
02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:03.630
Your bread.
He said this,
I'm going to pick us up in here.

2091
02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:06.350
They use your footage for the documentary of suckers.

2092
02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:11.000
Bridgend x files just on these are dummies without Google.

2093
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:14.770
Watch what happens to them.
Keep Google in your life.
Okay.

2094
02:03:14.771 --> 02:03:18.050
If you're on the run a road trip,
you're on the road doing,

2095
02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:21.170
doing a Gig and you ran out.
Give me a better example.
Can be a better example.

2096
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:23.190
And you rent a car with a gps in it.

2097
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:28.310
Say it didn't have GPS and getting off.
I rent the car,
you get lost.

2098
02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:31.280
It's four in the morning.
You get completely lost your your car.

2099
02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:34.280
I'll do what I did in high school and I'll find my way home and it'd be such a

2100
02:03:34.281 --> 02:03:39.080
fun adventure.
That'd be such a fun adventure.
Trying to find your way home.
Oh,

2101
02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:42.530
we used to do it all the time.
I would just let myself get lost on purpose.

2102
02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:45.800
Oh God.
It was fun.
You're learning surroundings that way.

2103
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:49.640
You really see a city that seems like a terrible suggestion.
Get lost on purpose.

2104
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:53.450
When I was in Shanghai and I had the fucking gps telling me exactly which public

2105
02:03:53.451 --> 02:03:55.940
transportation directions to get there.
That's amazing.
That's awesome.

2106
02:03:55.941 --> 02:03:58.220
And I'll miss that.
I might get a gps.

2107
02:03:58.790 --> 02:04:03.050
How about you just have a little discipline here?
Fucking iPhone.

2108
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:08.810
Texting sucks.
Your voice quality sucks.
But I'll tell you,
that's a shackle son.

2109
02:04:08.930 --> 02:04:12.260
That's technological shackle.
I'll tell you what I've found really interesting.

2110
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:15.870
And also by the way,
you can watch my special on your iPhone.
So yeah,

2111
02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:18.590
you can watch on a flip phone.
No,
you cannot watch it off my phone.

2112
02:04:18.591 --> 02:04:21.590
Please watch it on my flip phone.
Um,

2113
02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.490
the reaction people give me,
to me it's like,

2114
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:29.270
I'm just doing this for a while is really similar to the reaction of smokers

2115
02:04:29.271 --> 02:04:32.720
give when you say I'm quitting smoking a pill.
Poppers give,

2116
02:04:32.721 --> 02:04:36.020
when you say I'm done with pills or alcohol,
it's real similar.

2117
02:04:36.021 --> 02:04:38.010
People react sort of viscerally.
They

2118
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:43.010
<v 3>get angry at you here on that right now you are here like [inaudible] get mad.</v>

2119
02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:47.220
[inaudible] you were all talking but like,
like what are you doing?
Stop that.

2120
02:04:47.710 --> 02:04:50.390
It's like,
why do you care so much?
People that have addictions,

2121
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:53.190
like if you're a coffee drinker and you go to have coffee with your friends

2122
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:57.510
every morning,
but if you did,
no,
I don't do that,

2123
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:58.620
then they go.
No,

2124
02:04:58.621 --> 02:05:03.030
but I'm saying what I'm saying is if a guy just quit on you stop drinking coffee

2125
02:05:03.031 --> 02:05:05.580
and you meet every day,
like you're not going to have coffee.
No,
I don't want to.

2126
02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:08.380
I'm going to have a water.
Oh,
well you're too good for coffee.
Yeah,
exactly.

2127
02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:11.130
Come on.
Have a fucking coffee.
What are we doing?
And have a coffee,

2128
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:14.100
but it was like,
come on,
you get rid of your iPhone,
dude.
We have iPhones.

2129
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:18.060
We have iPhone doing cut.
Don't fuck this up.

2130
02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:21.090
I want to be able to Google.
I want to be just like you.
I love it.

2131
02:05:21.210 --> 02:05:26.100
I love Google and Uber back and forth,
back and forth.
It's like pros and cons.

2132
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:27.780
It's really outweigh each other.
I don't,

2133
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:31.550
I'm going to try it this way for a little bit.
Why don't you just trust just,

2134
02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:35.550
this is just,
why don't you just,
this is just,
why don't you try this?

2135
02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:39.610
Why don't you try going back to iPhone like a fucking human.
Yeah,

2136
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:44.250
and then this is the move.
This is the move.
Just write a rule,

2137
02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:48.720
a rule where you can't look at your phone.
I had one more.
I was like,

2138
02:05:48.721 --> 02:05:51.450
I won't even,
I won't check it until it go.
Just let me go to a coffee shop,

2139
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:53.400
which is like a block away from me in New York.

2140
02:05:53.490 --> 02:05:55.860
How about we just go outside and then that can check it off from there.

2141
02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:58.980
You and I was like,
well let me check once before I go out.
Give yourself,

2142
02:05:59.070 --> 02:06:03.570
give yourself three points in the day where you're allowed to text message.

2143
02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:06.330
Are you going to check text messages?
Can I translate that for you?

2144
02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.140
Are you going to tell him that about cigarettes?
Um,

2145
02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:11.110
I'm not telling him about you.
Only you only get three cigarettes then.

2146
02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:13.800
That's a good way to do it.
You know a dog's ear right out of the litter box.

2147
02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:14.551
He's one of those.

2148
02:06:14.551 --> 02:06:17.390
And he yelled at him a couple of times and he keeps stopping fucking

2149
02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:22.080
torso deep into a litter box.
She went on cat shit.

2150
02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:25.140
Those dogs are always going to eat.
Catch it.
You know,
why didn't they like it?

2151
02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.680
You got to leave them alone.
Alright.
Alright.

2152
02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:31.200
But a smoker you're going to tell them to like you smoke three a day,

2153
02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:34.280
but I can't tell him that.
No,
not that I can tell you that you're right,

2154
02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.730
but you wouldn't tell me to smoke three a day.

2155
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:39.750
I would not tell you to stop any so stop cause that's going to give you cancer

2156
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:41.400
but I don't think the cell phone is going to give you cancer.

2157
02:06:41.401 --> 02:06:42.410
Have you checked your test message?

2158
02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:46.650
Check your text messages three times a day but it won't just be that you're

2159
02:06:46.651 --> 02:06:48.630
right there.
If you only give yourself three strikes,

2160
02:06:48.631 --> 02:06:51.030
carry around a pack of cigarettes in your pocket and say don't smoke any.

2161
02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.880
Give yourself three strikes.
Always.

2162
02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:55.800
Did they have these programs that you can say it lights up so you've gone over

2163
02:06:55.801 --> 02:06:59.370
your hour.
I'm a man or that use.
I'm a man.
I don't even know fucking program.

2164
02:06:59.550 --> 02:07:02.700
You just tell yourself I don't.
I don't really think I need any of those things.

2165
02:07:02.710 --> 02:07:05.640
Besides text and email,
texting,
email,
text and phone.

2166
02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:08.520
Do you still have a copy serve email address?
My agents.
I tell them like,

2167
02:07:08.521 --> 02:07:09.151
if you need me something,

2168
02:07:09.151 --> 02:07:11.520
follow up with the only right away you're going to have to just call me or text

2169
02:07:11.521 --> 02:07:14.640
me and say,
Hey,
I sent you an email and check that.
Cause they business wise,

2170
02:07:14.641 --> 02:07:16.860
they always feel like that anyway.
Like how can even check the email?
Like,

2171
02:07:16.861 --> 02:07:18.810
I don't know.
It's been four hours.
Right.

2172
02:07:18.811 --> 02:07:21.270
They want you to be checking your email all day long.
You're in an office.

2173
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:22.600
I'm not.
Yeah,
immediately.

2174
02:07:22.670 --> 02:07:25.450
And it's weird that they don't want to talk to you on phone.
Just call.
Yeah.
It's,

2175
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:29.010
hey.
All right.
Listen,
you gotta listen to this.
He said new offer coming in.

2176
02:07:29.130 --> 02:07:32.760
They want you to shave your beard porn.
I get it,
man.
Yeah.
Porn.

2177
02:07:32.761 --> 02:07:35.840
I've got to drag my whole fucking laptop over my bed like a God damn fucking

2178
02:07:35.841 --> 02:07:36.674
bitch.

2179
02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:40.990
<v 4>Oh,
can I asshole?
Why don't you do it that we had done?
You can't just fucking,
ah,</v>

2180
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:44.140
oh God.
It's awful.
He runs out of battery runs out

2181
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:50.560
or Ari,
it's not like,
aw
damn.

2182
02:07:50.561 --> 02:07:52.750
It feels good to be a gangster.
Yeah.
Ari.

2183
02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:57.630
She fear given as little foxes possible slinging some 1996 technology out of

2184
02:07:57.650 --> 02:07:59.850
EBS.
I was like,
did you have a special at a show coming out?

2185
02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.490
Why do you have a flip phone?
It seems like that's not even the best one.

2186
02:08:03.491 --> 02:08:07.040
You can go.
I researched it.
It's pretty good.
Damn.
It feels good.

2187
02:08:07.150 --> 02:08:11.610
This one's one of the better ones.
300 contacts.
Yeah.

2188
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:14.800
I didn't realize that would be an issue until it was like no fucking way.

2189
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:17.890
Some of these are a hundred contacts.
Wow.
Yeah.

2190
02:08:18.370 --> 02:08:21.820
You're going to decide this one has 300 so that's good.
300 plus I think.

2191
02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:24.280
You know,
you've got to look at 300 dude.

2192
02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:27.520
It's like for phone calls for calling people pretty fucking dope.
Yeah.

2193
02:08:27.521 --> 02:08:30.760
You get you right up to your ear.
Yeah.
Does it doesn't have,

2194
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:34.780
does it have Bluetooth?
It does sync up with a car.
Have you done that yet?
No,

2195
02:08:34.781 --> 02:08:38.290
but I could but I don't drive my Bluetooth it from the other phone.

2196
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:40.050
Where do they fit it?

2197
02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:45.100
Between the battery and all the phone shit.
But when you think about it,
man,

2198
02:08:45.101 --> 02:08:49.170
like there's something satisfying about like going well,
looking at open know.

2199
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:52.660
Oh yeah,
hang up.
Just like that.
We'll take that part.
Feels good.
That's a pro.

2200
02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:53.980
All right.
Take care of pro.

2201
02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:56.470
That's pretty darn sure you get a case that would do that.

2202
02:08:56.471 --> 02:08:57.620
They should have that for iPhone cases.

2203
02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:02.440
It's a slap shot and there's no like pocket calls or nobody's stupid shit.

2204
02:09:02.650 --> 02:09:06.700
There's no pocket texting or you open up and you're all fucking,
your phone's on.

2205
02:09:06.701 --> 02:09:09.610
Spotify has a lot of unexpected thing.
Oh yeah,
exactly.
It is that,

2206
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:10.473
how did it do that?

2207
02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:13.870
People skyping me all of a sudden genx trying to make the call.

2208
02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:19.630
Thanks.
Yeah,
this is pretty dope,
dude.
I would have to have a phone too,

2209
02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:22.960
but I went and started doing way more sets in New York 23 or four night.
I would,

2210
02:09:22.961 --> 02:09:24.940
uh,
my body reacted weird after a while.
I was like,
oh,

2211
02:09:24.941 --> 02:09:26.050
I think there's too many spots.

2212
02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:28.630
Because I was like not really getting the most out of them.

2213
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:32.290
And then I just overcame that like learning curve and I was like,
oh,

2214
02:09:32.291 --> 02:09:34.540
actually okay if I just gear up for it,
this is fine.

2215
02:09:34.570 --> 02:09:36.860
But it just felt too many because it was twice or three times as many I was

2216
02:09:36.861 --> 02:09:38.530
getting before,
you know?

2217
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:41.440
But then it was like had to get used to it and now it's like,
cool,
I like that.

2218
02:09:41.441 --> 02:09:44.230
And now I've had one spot at night in New York.
It's like,
oh,
come on,

2219
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.410
that's wasting it.
Oh,
that's interesting.
Yeah.

2220
02:09:47.650 --> 02:09:50.560
So a lot of these low with his phone where it's like,
oh,
I got to have that.

2221
02:09:50.561 --> 02:09:51.490
It's like easy.

2222
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:54.850
You'll get over it just like cigarette or just where it's like if you wait 10

2223
02:09:54.851 --> 02:09:57.340
minutes for smoking,
that's a good way to quit smoking.

2224
02:09:57.341 --> 02:09:59.020
If you wait 10 minutes every time you have an urge.

2225
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:02.450
And then if you still have the urge to go for it,
get back to me is,

2226
02:10:02.451 --> 02:10:04.420
it's like promoting shows.
I even like,
Oh,

2227
02:10:04.421 --> 02:10:06.520
I need pretty much judge while I'm on the road,
you know?
I'm like,

2228
02:10:06.521 --> 02:10:08.240
I'm like going and get something to eat.
I'm like,

2229
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:10.270
we gotta be better about doing that from my computer.

2230
02:10:10.271 --> 02:10:14.710
But you can time tweets out from hoot suite.
Really easy.
It's sometimes,
yeah,

2231
02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:16.210
sometimes.
Sure.
And then there's,

2232
02:10:16.211 --> 02:10:19.360
sometimes you write a whole bit because you're meeting someone and you're not in

2233
02:10:19.361 --> 02:10:23.200
your phone checking your fucking Instagram and you have a of all that meeting.

2234
02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:26.201
I mean,
you've said it,

2235
02:10:26.201 --> 02:10:28.510
you've seen all the people on stage doing jokes about apps.

2236
02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.090
It's nonstop because everybody's life.
I just,

2237
02:10:31.091 --> 02:10:33.890
I guess I use my phone for way more than just Twitter.

2238
02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:36.170
You also use it for way more than just work.

2239
02:10:36.690 --> 02:10:39.390
<v 7>Yeah,
but I mean I'm using it as my voice recorder on stage.</v>

2240
02:10:39.391 --> 02:10:43.200
I'm using for my g my ways on the way home here to just see which way I should

2241
02:10:43.201 --> 02:10:47.090
drive home some nights wasting an extra hour in traffic.
Right,
right,
right.

2242
02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:52.350
You know,
there's just so many like little things that like,
I mean,

2243
02:10:52.650 --> 02:10:55.890
do you eat 24 so when I get home there's going to be food waiting for me.

2244
02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:00.770
I can't,
you know,
there's so many little things that,
you know,
it's,

2245
02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:03.660
<v 4>yeah,
but you don't have a problem with being addicted to your phone.</v>

2246
02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:07.290
It doesn't freak you out.
I think what Ari's doing is

2247
02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:13.110
you're trying to optimize the way you think and you're trying to optimize where

2248
02:11:13.111 --> 02:11:16.050
you focus your attention on and you felt like you were spending too much time

2249
02:11:16.051 --> 02:11:20.460
just staring at a little device and it was taking away from the way you think,

2250
02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.200
taken away from the way you interact with people.

2251
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:26.070
Just totally taken away from that way and interact with people.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2252
02:11:26.250 --> 02:11:28.740
Yeah.
Well just saying that,
you saying that and you know,

2253
02:11:28.741 --> 02:11:33.120
taking into consideration,
it made me reconsider it.
This is this etiquette.

2254
02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:36.300
It's evolving with it now where people are on it during dinner a lot,
you know?

2255
02:11:36.301 --> 02:11:36.811
And it's like,
well,

2256
02:11:36.811 --> 02:11:40.200
we don't know we were supposed to or not because it's such a fast changing thing

2257
02:11:40.201 --> 02:11:44.070
that we haven't built a fucking a way of a,
or a system around it.

2258
02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:46.890
So we're developing it now.
You know,

2259
02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.830
it's becoming more and more like put your phone away.
It's dinner time.
Right.

2260
02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:52.590
You know?
Right,
right.
But it's like we're going to develop,
we don't know.

2261
02:11:52.591 --> 02:11:55.040
It's just getting busier and busier and all the time and yeah,

2262
02:11:55.041 --> 02:11:57.740
it takes you away from who we were around because isn't that what it hipster

2263
02:11:57.741 --> 02:12:01.680
stays and that with the whole thing,
that hipster is what it's like against the,

2264
02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.910
you know,
that's not hipster yet is
hipster.
Right.

2265
02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:10.340
That's exactly the term of him against the norm.
When you think about,

2266
02:12:10.410 --> 02:12:14.970
goths also went about like all those groups are against like the norm.
Yeah.
Hips.

2267
02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:19.470
You're just one of those groups that's upstairs was just Uber fashionable.

2268
02:12:19.950 --> 02:12:24.690
Well they're just fighting against what they think is like a staid and boring

2269
02:12:25.110 --> 02:12:27.660
standard.
Yeah.
You know?
But yeah,

2270
02:12:27.661 --> 02:12:32.340
fighting against the currently accepted dress codes and all that shit.

2271
02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:34.380
Wear cardigans.
There's something to like,

2272
02:12:34.381 --> 02:12:36.600
you know how when you're on stage and you can't think of a joke and you're just

2273
02:12:36.601 --> 02:12:37.434
like doing it anyway,

2274
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:40.350
but you need an ending and you just put the panic in your mind will force you to

2275
02:12:40.351 --> 02:12:41.940
create an ending.
Right.
Then at times,
yeah.

2276
02:12:42.190 --> 02:12:45.900
If you don't have your phone to go to when you're in an uncomfortable social

2277
02:12:45.901 --> 02:12:48.260
situation,
you'll feel that uncomfort,
um,

2278
02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:50.640
comfort level for awhile and then your body will like,

2279
02:12:50.641 --> 02:12:53.190
I don't like feeling this way,
so instead of going to my phone,

2280
02:12:53.191 --> 02:12:57.060
that was a way out.
Now it's like,
Oh hey,
you're a Raiders fan too.
Yeah,

2281
02:12:57.061 --> 02:13:00.570
I fucking man,
whatever.
They had some good years there,
whatever it is.

2282
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:03.660
Just something to get out of this uncomfortable thing.

2283
02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:08.520
Can't just met somebody at home now with them trying to make a new friend and

2284
02:13:08.521 --> 02:13:13.521
they're on Uber all day and you're on Uber or Ram or storage place following all

2285
02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.280
these cars tweeting up a storm and Facebook and up the joint.

2286
02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:24.420
I could see he spoke offers nothing new your life anymore,
but it does.

2287
02:13:24.450 --> 02:13:25.710
If you like Facebook,

2288
02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:31.260
it's for some people Facebook is this like their community of Friends of friends

2289
02:13:31.261 --> 02:13:32.130
that you're like,
I don't even

2290
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:35.940
<v 0>know most of these people.
Most people don't know most of their Facebook friends.</v>

2291
02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.140
Right.
I have no memory.

2292
02:13:37.141 --> 02:13:41.160
They have to really think hard and they're just an online community.
I Dunno.

2293
02:13:41.190 --> 02:13:43.770
It's okay.
When you go,
that part's cool.
But then you're missing other parts.

2294
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:47.370
What do you think about the potential for virtual reality's online?

2295
02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:50.710
Have you ever talked to Duncan about this?
You know what I mean?

2296
02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:54.210
He showed me this oculus game.
Have you seen the new version of the old version?

2297
02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:57.120
I saw one from like a few months ago.
Yeah,
that's the,

2298
02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:58.680
I haven't seen the new one either,

2299
02:13:58.681 --> 02:14:03.120
but he called me at the Improv one night with fevered pitch in his voice.

2300
02:14:03.121 --> 02:14:04.380
Man,
it's out.

2301
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:09.050
<v 8>Game Changer,
man.
Dude,
this is fucking bigger than yet.
Annette,</v>

2302
02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:12.300
this is bigger than space travel.
This is bigger than anything.

2303
02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:15.160
Told me about this a oculus rift where it,

2304
02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:20.150
<v 0>it's this guy goes into this room and it's all in like four k HD and he said,</v>

2305
02:14:20.151 --> 02:14:23.600
you really feel like you're in this room and you walk up to a piano when you

2306
02:14:23.601 --> 02:14:28.100
interact with this guy that's at the piano.
He's like,
it is a mind fuck.
He said,

2307
02:14:28.101 --> 02:14:32.900
it's so stunning and so realistic that you know,
it just makes you realize like,

2308
02:14:32.901 --> 02:14:36.020
oh my God,
this is like if,
if technology,

2309
02:14:36.050 --> 02:14:38.930
inevitably we all agree is going to continue to get better.

2310
02:14:39.170 --> 02:14:42.260
I mean we've all experienced nothing but that in our life and there's been some

2311
02:14:42.261 --> 02:14:43.460
bottlenecks along the way,

2312
02:14:43.461 --> 02:14:47.180
but people always figure out some new power source or some new battery supply or

2313
02:14:47.181 --> 02:14:50.960
soup.
People figure out how to get people unlike any of us in this room,
right.

2314
02:14:50.961 --> 02:14:52.280
They figured out how to get through that shit.

2315
02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:55.160
We assume that they're going to keep doing that and if they keep doing it,

2316
02:14:55.161 --> 02:14:59.180
if they're at that now in 2015 is insanely fucking rich,

2317
02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:03.070
high definition oculus rift where you're looking around,

2318
02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:06.260
it almost feels like you're in the room.
They apparently,
the way they filmed it,

2319
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:08.000
they put cameras all over the guy.

2320
02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:12.020
So like everywhere you look like they have like an image for that.

2321
02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.990
Well you can look down,
you can look up,
you can look at the sky,

2322
02:15:14.991 --> 02:15:17.670
you could walk through the room and look behind you.
Like you,
you,

2323
02:15:17.671 --> 02:15:20.810
you're walking into it like it's a three dimensional environment and they're

2324
02:15:20.811 --> 02:15:22.640
going to be able to do that with these,

2325
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:26.420
they have these like circular treadmills there.
3D treadmills.

2326
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:29.930
So it's like the hollow hollow suite from a star wars.
Yes.

2327
02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:31.820
You just running around in these things.

2328
02:15:31.821 --> 02:15:35.270
You put the head gear on and you sort of like run around on this

2329
02:15:35.271 --> 02:15:37.070
multi-directional treadmill.

2330
02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:41.300
The treadmill goes left and right and back and forth and as you're moving around

2331
02:15:41.301 --> 02:15:45.560
on it,
like eventually you sort of get a groove with what you're seeing and your

2332
02:15:45.561 --> 02:15:49.160
headset and what you're feeling when you're running around and you're running

2333
02:15:49.161 --> 02:15:54.110
through this artificial world.
Wow,
this is going to get really intense man.
Yeah.

2334
02:15:54.111 --> 02:15:57.050
Then what are the longterm effects of that?
Like I'm short term.
It's like,

2335
02:15:57.051 --> 02:15:59.270
oh I dunno,
but like longterm it's something different too.

2336
02:15:59.271 --> 02:16:02.360
Like how does it feel once you would like the kids today?
Like your kids.

2337
02:16:02.590 --> 02:16:05.220
A lot of people get sick from it though.
That's it.
Oh yeah,
I was nauseous.

2338
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:08.420
That's what they kept selling and stuff.
[inaudible] it's like,
yeah,
some,

2339
02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:11.900
some people have a really hard time with like cars.
Even with it,

2340
02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:14.570
you don't know which way it's going or you've looked down and it looks a little

2341
02:16:14.571 --> 02:16:16.070
bit less down than you're looking.
Yeah,

2342
02:16:16.071 --> 02:16:19.070
I have one and it kind of makes me after like a good three minutes,
I'm like,

2343
02:16:19.071 --> 02:16:22.100
all right,
I got it taken off the infringer eyeballs.
So if you look down,

2344
02:16:22.170 --> 02:16:24.710
then you're looking at there,
but then you look further down with your eyeballs,

2345
02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:27.080
you know,
but it just reads it.
Your head is going down.

2346
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:31.270
Maybe because when I'm in the front seat on Laurel Canyon and not driving,

2347
02:16:31.271 --> 02:16:33.040
I don't know when it's going to turn right or left.

2348
02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:36.310
That's when I get the most nauseous.
What they're going to do eventually,

2349
02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:40.270
they're going to be able to three d map your body and you're going to be able to

2350
02:16:40.271 --> 02:16:41.104
just show up,

2351
02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:46.260
like kicking the door of an orgy and chicks are just going to hop onto your Dick

2352
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:47.980
and you're going to feel it.

2353
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:51.420
You're gonna feel them touching your body field and touch it.
You know,

2354
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:55.240
go into this thing with electrodes placed various spots in your head.

2355
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:57.880
I mean if you make it bond basically real,
perfectly real,
where did you,

2356
02:16:57.970 --> 02:17:01.180
your body can't tell the difference then QMAP and you're not really going to

2357
02:17:01.181 --> 02:17:01.871
have a reason to leave.

2358
02:17:01.871 --> 02:17:05.320
The only reason I leave and see the outside world because you can't replace for

2359
02:17:05.321 --> 02:17:07.900
Gout,
but if it's Kevin replace reality,
then it's like really?

2360
02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:09.190
There's no difference.
They there.

2361
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:12.760
You would want to live in somewhere that we want to look ducks like Montana in

2362
02:17:12.761 --> 02:17:17.100
the winter just for like a day where it's really brutal.
You want to just to,

2363
02:17:17.101 --> 02:17:22.101
just to appreciate the reality difference between what this artificial world is

2364
02:17:22.271 --> 02:17:25.510
that you have in your little computer set up and what the real world is outside.

2365
02:17:25.511 --> 02:17:27.790
What if you get,
it's getting sun in the artificial world.

2366
02:17:27.850 --> 02:17:32.020
I'll bet you can I it fill your vitamin D sun while you're getting blown on the

2367
02:17:32.021 --> 02:17:36.670
beach.
One son,
you know you're at the mass of a boat or kings real draining on.

2368
02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:39.100
If you got it wrapped around your wrist several times,

2369
02:17:39.101 --> 02:17:42.310
you're holding onto the mass to being pulled across the ocean.

2370
02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:46.600
You can hurt all those things like that.
Well checks or blown.
Yeah.

2371
02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:52.030
Wow.
Come on.
That'd be great.
That's [inaudible].
That'd be great.

2372
02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:54.580
Keep magnification.

2373
02:17:54.610 --> 02:17:58.750
If we really do come up with some sort of technology that it replicates that,

2374
02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:02.890
that'd be what,
what incentive to people have to engage regularly going to,

2375
02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:05.440
so let's just assume they're going to stop cause I don't see a reason why they

2376
02:18:05.441 --> 02:18:09.580
would.
That's carry as fuck to think that you could create an artificial world.

2377
02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:13.420
There'll be so intoxicating that people wouldn't want to participate in the

2378
02:18:13.421 --> 02:18:15.280
regular world were on that direction.
Now,

2379
02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:18.720
who as soon as this podcast ends you both,
all three of you and I would have to,

2380
02:18:18.721 --> 02:18:20.920
I'm going to bury yourself in your phone for the next 30 minutes.

2381
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:26.050
Catch up in correct.
My willpower is outstanding.

2382
02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:29.260
You feel a nagging at you at all times to write.
I certainly do.

2383
02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:32.140
That's like a pull,
like,
Oh God,
I gotta stop.
I gotta check this.

2384
02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:34.230
I'm getting way better at it.
Getting way better,

2385
02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:35.860
like putting it down and just leaving it somewhere.

2386
02:18:35.861 --> 02:18:39.370
I'm developing a manner system about it,
but people get upset.

2387
02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:42.600
That's the other thing.
If you,
if someone texts you and they're like,
you know,

2388
02:18:42.601 --> 02:18:46.030
and they'll text you like three hours later or not like,
sorry,

2389
02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:48.220
I just got back to my phone.
Like I put it down for a while.

2390
02:18:48.221 --> 02:18:52.330
I don't want to be always available at all times and go see a movie.

2391
02:18:52.331 --> 02:18:53.480
People like don't even give you a raw.

2392
02:18:54.250 --> 02:18:57.700
I lock it in and just drop it on and I forget I even have it on.

2393
02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:58.690
You got to do that.

2394
02:18:58.691 --> 02:19:02.620
I think you've got to disconnect and I know you promote shows and you promote

2395
02:19:02.621 --> 02:19:06.790
shows and I promote shows and you know,
like you,
you can use that as an excuse,

2396
02:19:06.791 --> 02:19:09.460
but I think there's something very admirable about what you're doing.

2397
02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.860
I think there's a,
there's some wisdom in what you're doing too.

2398
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:15.670
Well that's all I wanted.
Some goddamn respect.
I'm respecting it.

2399
02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:19.360
I think it's the move.
I think the two have both is the move.

2400
02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:24.340
But to give that to your closest friends,
I think that's the move.
So when you,
uh,

2401
02:19:24.341 --> 02:19:28.430
you have to do some horse shit,
you know,
you got to do some fucking tax problems.

2402
02:19:28.431 --> 02:19:29.151
You got to call on it too.

2403
02:19:29.151 --> 02:19:32.500
He had that guy sign this and specs that Monday locker on the phone,

2404
02:19:32.550 --> 02:19:36.140
all that shit on the phone.
Do that on the iPhone.
But all your friends,

2405
02:19:36.141 --> 02:19:37.820
your actual real social interactions,

2406
02:19:37.821 --> 02:19:40.460
if you put someone in your regular flip phone,
you really care about them.

2407
02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:44.920
You just keep this in your car just in case if you need to drive or go to see

2408
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:48.020
what a good way that's just keep it in my car so I couldn't even use it,
my bed.

2409
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:50.690
And you can keep that on you.
So just to make,

2410
02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:52.700
if you have to plug the battery into the,

2411
02:19:52.701 --> 02:19:57.470
into the thing and it's super glue that literally cannot unplug it from the car

2412
02:19:57.471 --> 02:20:00.830
charger ever again.
Yeah.
Why?
It's not going to have my car leave it in my car.

2413
02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:03.290
That's actually a good move.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2414
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:07.520
I mean you could always break it loose and go some fucking asshole.

2415
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:12.410
Super glued my charger to my phone.
Can you fix this?
They just get her a new one.

2416
02:20:12.411 --> 02:20:15.740
I guess that'd be too hard to get on right there and go on Twitter.
Apple Care,

2417
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:19.520
they probably have a Kensington lock or a case that's a Kensington lock,

2418
02:20:19.521 --> 02:20:20.430
which is trying to lock.

2419
02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:24.590
It's just a case for an iPhone that you can just connect it to like a wire,

2420
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:27.310
kind of what they use as displays at Alvarez.

2421
02:20:27.850 --> 02:20:29.820
Can't steal it or something like that.

2422
02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:34.660
Glues to it or something outside of it.
Yeah.
I guess if you,

2423
02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:35.840
they have them at best buy,

2424
02:20:35.841 --> 02:20:38.150
they would have to be able to sell them to regular people.

2425
02:20:38.151 --> 02:20:42.230
It's not like it's government secrets or some shit.
Yeah,
it was by one of those.

2426
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:45.500
Yeah.
You probably could.
You just keep that shit in your phone,
your car,

2427
02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:47.510
or maybe in your house.
Great.

2428
02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:50.200
Let's go to an apple store after here and we'll get you an iPhone.

2429
02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:56.980
I need to get into this in the game.
I'm off the train you a little bit harder.

2430
02:20:57.010 --> 02:21:00.710
One Junkie,
just off the train.
Hard to track you at that phone.

2431
02:21:01.250 --> 02:21:03.540
And where are you at?
That's it.
Catch you on

2432
02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:09.670
like a track at my friends at all times.
That was one of the,
uh,
this,
this,

2433
02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:14.350
there's several things stand out as being a ridiculous to call racist.
Uh,

2434
02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:18.620
one of them was Margaret show at the Golden Globes,
you know,
and with this thing,

2435
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:21.110
Margaret showed the Golden Globes,
uh,
played,

2436
02:21:21.111 --> 02:21:26.111
came Giang loons publicist from North Korea or really put like white face on

2437
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:31.680
like put on like,
like Pale makeup and like played the dictator,

2438
02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:34.300
a dictator or someone who works for the dictator.
Right.

2439
02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:38.210
And people were saying that it's racist.
I'm like,
dude,
she's fucking,

2440
02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:42.500
that's the race she is.
She said it's not racist.
It's racist.

2441
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:49.010
I don't give a fuck.
She's great.
Well,
she's fucking Korean.

2442
02:21:49.011 --> 02:21:54.000
Not only that,
she's a mixed North Korean and South Korean.
Okay.
So fuck off man.

2443
02:21:54.030 --> 02:21:57.140
She can say whatever she wants.
Like it's just people are just waiting.

2444
02:21:57.290 --> 02:22:01.760
They are just sweaty.
Trigger finger say racist.
Here's the problem.

2445
02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:08.280
This is not just saying a racist thing is not racist acts or racist murdering

2446
02:22:08.841 --> 02:22:12.830
people because they're black.
That's racist.
Just saying,
I hate black people.

2447
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.170
You haven't done anything to the world so fine.

2448
02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:16.380
So it's right as you haven't done anything,

2449
02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:19.980
go off to people who are actually doing something.
Yeah,
I guess,
but I mean that,

2450
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.930
oh,
this guy has that opinion.
Okay,
so let him have that opinion.
Just ignore him.

2451
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:25.980
That's him being as racist.
Sell

2452
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.640
<v 3>fine,</v>

2453
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:29.640
but you can't not hire black people at your company or we're going to run you

2454
02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:33.090
out of here.
That's the line doing something.
Yeah,

2455
02:22:33.091 --> 02:22:34.980
but you don't want a hostile work environment.

2456
02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.410
You don't want somebody going out to people and say,
fuck you chink.

2457
02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:38.321
You don't want that.

2458
02:22:38.321 --> 02:22:42.430
And obviously I chose Cenk because the other one's going to be too divisive than

2459
02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:45.680
other words.
The N one.
Are you going to say that?
Thinking about it,

2460
02:22:45.690 --> 02:22:48.870
I switched last minute and Kevin with check scare.
You don't want that.

2461
02:22:48.871 --> 02:22:51.510
But if somebody wants to think that then fucking fine.
Yeah,

2462
02:22:51.511 --> 02:22:54.630
but don't do anything about it.
Fine.
Right.
You don't want them around you.
Right.

2463
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:58.010
But that's not up to you.
I don't want fucking about,

2464
02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:01.440
but your spreads around me either if you love it to me.
Okay.
All righty.

2465
02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:05.220
If you start a factory producing the Irish fear tee shirts and you're in that

2466
02:23:05.221 --> 02:23:06.210
office all day long,

2467
02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:08.850
you choose to answer the phone cause you want to take care of this business.

2468
02:23:08.850 --> 02:23:09.510
Correct.

2469
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:12.500
And you're hired two guys and one of them turns out to be racist and every day

2470
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:15.930
he says a bunch of stupid racist shit and he poisoned by making the environment

2471
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:17.760
that it's different.
Well they all are.

2472
02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:21.750
Anybody that's racist or sexist and they say something at home and find out.

2473
02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:25.110
They say something later at outside of office hours at home,
then no,

2474
02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:27.570
that's not a problem for my office.
Not Outside of.
Okay,

2475
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:29.430
so it's legally to join the Klan.

2476
02:23:29.610 --> 02:23:34.610
How dare it's legal to do this very outspokenly racist thing that's legal.

2477
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:37.680
You know the clan is trying to invite Puerto Rican Zinn.
Really?

2478
02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:41.310
Why they're invest short,
failing all these other people and showing up,

2479
02:23:41.311 --> 02:23:45.690
trying to expand their horizons.
I'm talking Mr. Yes,
they are.
Oh my God.

2480
02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:50.460
That's amazing.
I pull up the story.
The KKK is trying to expand their horizons.

2481
02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:54.690
It doesn't seem like a good idea,
but inviting minorities.

2482
02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:58.230
I just Puerto Rican,
so why bother?
Well,

2483
02:23:58.231 --> 02:24:01.320
I think they're trying to solve what does to vilify people that say racist

2484
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:06.030
things is make it so that no one can speak.
The KKK is accepting black members.

2485
02:24:06.390 --> 02:24:10.620
Here is what is actually happening.
This is hilarious.
Yeah.

2486
02:24:10.621 --> 02:24:12.390
Just come into the clubhouse guys.

2487
02:24:12.391 --> 02:24:15.650
I just go through this door was sectional Jewish people.
Yes.
You're ready,
Randy,

2488
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:17.790
to accept African Americans,
man,

2489
02:24:17.791 --> 02:24:21.720
you would really have to hate other black people to join the KKK as a black guy.

2490
02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:26.440
Click on it instead of just,
yeah.
We're having a bit of an issue here.

2491
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:29.580
Hm.
Well,
in this time,

2492
02:24:29.581 --> 02:24:31.890
I guess I should tell you guys to starting a week from Thursday,

2493
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:35.130
my storytellers show this is not happening is on every night after at midnight.

2494
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:39.450
Oh,
good Lord.
That's amazing.
People who do it include from this podcast,

2495
02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:44.480
Joe Rogan and made incredible Chrysler's on Diaz is on a bunch of people deal

2496

Oh my goodness.
Segura powerful.

2497
02:24:50.970 --> 02:24:53.820
Toxocara fuck a bunch of people.
Miss Pat.

2498
02:24:55.370 --> 02:24:58.500
I'm forgetting a lot.
But Anyway,
eight weeks.
Oh,
there it is.
There it is.

2499
02:24:58.710 --> 02:25:01.500
I think you'll see a full episode right now if you go to the comedy central App

2500
02:25:01.530 --> 02:25:03.300
or comedy central standup.
But I gotta tell Ya,

2501
02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:05.920
I like the classic jacket you're wearing there.
Something like that.

2502
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.090
I got that in Hong Kong and look good.
It looks like I'm very good.

2503
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:12.240
They told me I had to,
uh,
I had to break out one that'll fit the whole time.

2504
02:25:12.241 --> 02:25:15.720
And I was like,
you know what?
That was the right time for this suit.
Yeah.

2505
02:25:15.721 --> 02:25:19.280
How many shoots you have to now I've got to both made in Hong Kong.
Damn.

2506
02:25:19.350 --> 02:25:21.840
I had a third.
But that was like,
move out to la.
Find a real job.

2507
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:23.980
Did you decide like the style,
did you

2508
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:28.260
<v 0>just help me?
Just the,
I was handmade.
It looks nice.
I mean a,</v>

2509
02:25:28.261 --> 02:25:30.850
a style piece.
The wall that they have a style choose from.

2510
02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:34.690
There's like a few different cuts you can,
you can choose rocky.
He's the best.

2511
02:25:35.050 --> 02:25:38.410
That's amazing.
Dude,
you weren't tailored suits.
That's dope as fuck.

2512
02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:40.540
If we had your bucks,
son,
Europe baller,

2513
02:25:40.690 --> 02:25:45.690
you're an international baller international look at you should fear and it's

2514
02:25:45.701 --> 02:25:46.600
not herpes.

2515
02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:49.110
I remember when you were a doorman at the comedy store and now you're an

2516
02:25:49.111 --> 02:25:53.330
international mother.
Fucking baller.
A true American success story.

2517
02:25:54.430 --> 02:25:59.320
True American.
Holla at your boy.
Alright.
Shall fear next.
Yeah.

2518
02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:03.540
Yeah.
You excited to have your special play?
I'm excited.
I gotta be honest,
man.
Uh,

2519
02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:06.490
the people who listen to this podcast,
so the reason I was able to do that,

2520
02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:07.960
you know,
it was at the comedy central,

2521
02:26:07.961 --> 02:26:11.050
would even like come up to a guy like me because of the force behind this thing.

2522
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:14.890
There's no way I can try to be as,
as good as I want,
but if I'm an outsider,

2523
02:26:14.891 --> 02:26:17.830
which I was,
that's it.
They didn't come and call on that way.
Yeah.
You know,

2524
02:26:17.831 --> 02:26:20.950
there's no outsiders anymore.
Yeah.
This is the real life.

2525
02:26:21.010 --> 02:26:24.880
Like these kind of shows,
Internet shows where there's no network behind it.

2526
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:29.770
That's the last bridge.
Yeah.
It was the last bridge between people.

2527
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:33.250
Yeah.
So people find me.
That's great.
And they put the money behind it.

2528
02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:36.520
Do a cool special at the comedy store,
make it look all cool.
Yeah,

2529
02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:41.260
don't play any of it Jim.
It looks great.
Looks Great.

2530
02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:46.120
I like the way that came out.
It looks awesome.
I mean it's so obviously the or,

2531
02:26:46.121 --> 02:26:48.910
but yet would like a little twist to it with those lights behind you.

2532
02:26:49.150 --> 02:26:53.930
Pretty cool.
Just like ever so slightly.
I took it down so much.
Yeah.
No,

2533
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:58.630
no,
no,
no.
Why this light bulb?
Get it out.
Get it out.
Get it out.

2534
02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:03.670
Yeah.
That fucking room is magical.
Great.
That room doesn't leave any,

2535
02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:07.590
there's,
there's no space for horse shit and there's no space for more shit.
Yeah,

2536
02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:11.980
it's weird.
It's weird like a riff and it's like,
good luck.
Well you can't cat.

2537
02:27:11.981 --> 02:27:13.030
And that's how it was bad example.

2538
02:27:13.031 --> 02:27:14.800
I mean like if it's not all there and you're like,
ah,

2539
02:27:14.801 --> 02:27:17.560
that we should have worked like,
no,
he wasn't good.
You've made a bad riff.

2540
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:20.110
It's okay.
They're not going to just laugh anyway.
Well,

2541
02:27:20.111 --> 02:27:23.470
it just forces you into that position where you really got to try hard to find

2542
02:27:23.471 --> 02:27:27.370
the right words and like that's one of the things that was talking about earlier

2543
02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:28.780
about this time that we're in right now.

2544
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:32.050
One of the cool things about it is if there's so many other really funny guys

2545
02:27:32.051 --> 02:27:36.520
around that we were all feeding off each other and you get inspired by each

2546
02:27:36.521 --> 02:27:39.340
other.
So you like everything is sort of ramped up in your,

2547
02:27:39.341 --> 02:27:42.640
even in your mind like,
oh your,
your connections to comedy,

2548
02:27:42.641 --> 02:27:46.150
your ideas are sort of ramped up because there's all these really good guys

2549
02:27:46.151 --> 02:27:50.650
around you all the time.
You know?
I think that's,
that's huge for any sort of,

2550
02:27:50.690 --> 02:27:53.920
oh yeah,
absolutely.
The Bar,
you see the bartender Meyer.
Yeah.

2551
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:55.790
It's once you see the bar set all high,
they're just like,

2552
02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:58.030
well that's what I should be aiming for.
Fall short of that,

2553
02:27:58.031 --> 02:27:59.780
which you will the beginning anyway.

2554
02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:01.960
Then it's like you're falling short at a 50th percentile,

2555
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:06.130
but if the bar is set at 40 yeah,
if you fall barely short,
you're still 39.

2556
02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:10.990
Well I think also one of the things that we sort of exhibited,
um,
after,
uh,

2557
02:28:11.530 --> 02:28:15.070
after I left the comedy store and when we started doing a lot of shit on the

2558
02:28:15.071 --> 02:28:20.071
Internet and start doing this podcast is that we're all sorta like banding

2559
02:28:20.201 --> 02:28:24.140
together as like,
like a group.
Like there's a,

2560
02:28:24.141 --> 02:28:29.141
a group of comedians that are all banding together and the more everybody else

2561
02:28:29.211 --> 02:28:31.970
does good,
the more everybody else does feel like more comedy.
Yeah.

2562
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.090
But if people see filter on like I saw my filter on this great man.
Yeah.

2563
02:28:35.091 --> 02:28:36.190
You should know about him.
Yeah.

2564
02:28:36.191 --> 02:28:38.150
In your town you should go with the guys like that.
It's like,
oh,

2565
02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:41.660
everybody's feeding off everybody and it's getting to this like really

2566
02:28:41.661 --> 02:28:46.240
interesting like pitch.
And if you look at like great communities,

2567
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:50.120
great communities of musicians,
great communities of comics,
like the,

2568
02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:53.600
the old Boston days that everybody always talks about like this.

2569
02:28:53.601 --> 02:28:57.110
I think this this day,
right now,
hey,
day is the hay day.
They're like,

2570
02:28:57.111 --> 02:29:00.260
we're in the heyday right now.
When I look around era.
Absolutely.

2571
02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:03.080
I agree with you without any of us in this room.
When I look,

2572
02:29:03.090 --> 02:29:05.810
I just extract us from the equation.
Just look at all the,

2573
02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:09.470
if you are just a comedy fan that was an insurance salesman or whatever,

2574
02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:12.120
like this is maybe the best time ever.
Yeah.

2575
02:29:12.290 --> 02:29:14.240
There's so many guys I want to say right now,

2576
02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:18.800
so one of those guys has a special permit,
the 16th at midnight,

2577
02:29:18.801 --> 02:29:22.760
1159 and it storytellers show probiotic January 22nd at,

2578
02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:27.240
but you should just be extra footage.
I Area Ari shift for the grade,

2579
02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:30.470
but some people just don't open up the walls that way.
If you're not a buyer,

2580
02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:32.020
then you're no buyer.
Still Watch it.
Yeah,

2581
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:34.370
but you could it just for the Jew and a,
I think it was under his is.

2582
02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:38.780
How do you feel about people pirating that Una?
Is that ultra insulting?
No.

2583
02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:41.140
What do you mean?
Why would it be insulting if someone said,
hey,

2584
02:29:41.410 --> 02:29:44.270
I got this awesome thing.
No,
I'm looking at this thing.

2585
02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:47.450
They're pirating your and a do you not understand what I'm saying?

2586
02:29:47.810 --> 02:29:51.410
You're going to look back and see how cheap joke.
Oh,
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.

2587
02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:53.630
I got it.
Sorry.
My fault.
Well,

2588
02:29:53.631 --> 02:29:57.410
you are a non Jewish supporter of pirating.

2589
02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.760
Like you never give a fuck.

2590
02:29:58.761 --> 02:30:02.620
Like you don't have this attitude like trying to maximize your income.

2591
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:04.140
It's like some people get ya.
Yay.

2592
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:08.920
<v 4>Of course.
The June is only available for the download,</v>

2593
02:30:08.921 --> 02:30:10.560
so if you don't get by the download,

2594
02:30:10.561 --> 02:30:13.170
how else are you going to see other than somebody fucking doing something with

2595
02:30:13.171 --> 02:30:17.190
it,
somebody saying,
hey,
you should come see this.
That's the way people,
you know,

2596
02:30:17.191 --> 02:30:19.290
they'll wrestling tapes were like that.
Let me show you.
Oh,

2597
02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:22.140
this wrestling match you didn't know about.
That's how you fucking,

2598
02:30:22.290 --> 02:30:25.260
that's why I just did a rough thing with wrestling.
Wrestling.
Yeah.

2599
02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:28.350
Well he used to trade tapes because it would look the regional ones around like

2600
02:30:28.351 --> 02:30:31.350
local TV.
Oh,
so people would have old tapes.
I'm like,
Oh look at,

2601
02:30:31.351 --> 02:30:33.960
this guy's moved and they would that.
It wasn't that.
It wasn't pirating.

2602
02:30:33.961 --> 02:30:37.860
It was like sharing information.
That's all this shit is.

2603
02:30:38.890 --> 02:30:42.640
I put up my own Intelsat for fucking cause Viacom.
I kept taking it down really,

2604
02:30:42.670 --> 02:30:45.210
but I had to call comedy central.
I'm like,
can you please put up my Intel set?

2605
02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:48.690
And they're like,
yeah,
okay.
Wow.
But it's like Ha,
just kidding.
Let me,

2606
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:51.710
it disbursed my information.
Yeah.

2607
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.320
If I think people are under the impression that if something's online,

2608
02:30:55.321 --> 02:30:59.640
they won't watch the television as much.
Separate markets,
separate markets.

2609
02:30:59.641 --> 02:31:03.960
You don't,
Bo Burnham released a special on Netflix and youtube.
Yeah.

2610
02:31:04.290 --> 02:31:06.150
Well he's a youtube celebrity.
I know,

2611
02:31:06.151 --> 02:31:09.130
but the people who watch it like that on youtube or not the kind of people want,

2612
02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:11.310
it's just like a sort of separate,
there's a little overlap,

2613
02:31:11.311 --> 02:31:13.660
but they're sort of separate.
There's an,

2614
02:31:13.661 --> 02:31:17.640
I watch concerts online and also overall for ticket sale.
That's great.

2615
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.660
Well those are also enough that spend that seven bucks a month every month on

2616
02:31:21.661 --> 02:31:24.810
Netflix and it's just as easy to get it through Netflix.
Like you're,

2617
02:31:24.811 --> 02:31:28.500
there's so many options of things that you can watch if you watch something like

2618
02:31:28.501 --> 02:31:33.200
Netflix.
Yeah.
And so and no commercials,
no commercial,
seven bucks,
no current.

2619
02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:34.320
Who has commercials,
right?

2620
02:31:34.350 --> 02:31:38.000
It's who half those commercials here and knowing what the same ones.
Yeah.

2621
02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:40.860
Like why are you showing the same commercial three times in an episode?

2622
02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:43.170
It is pretty fast though.
They're trying to steal your soul.

2623
02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:47.040
The cranky extra loud too.
They don't have those rules on them.
Come on,
man.

2624
02:31:47.041 --> 02:31:48.660
I mean,
neighbors were building,
listening.
Yeah.

2625
02:31:49.050 --> 02:31:51.000
Like if you're watching the walking dead or something like that,

2626
02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:55.230
that's really spooky being quiet guy.
Go look at them.

2627
02:31:55.240 --> 02:31:59.850
Those are packed.
You know,
it's funny.

2628
02:31:59.851 --> 02:32:01.710
All these networks have this very specific,
like,

2629
02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:04.020
this is what we want our network to be to be about.

2630
02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:08.220
And then I take these fucking ads that is so offensive to anyone sense of

2631
02:32:08.221 --> 02:32:09.054
creativity,

2632
02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:13.200
Taco bell ads that just fucking garbage based on shitty jokes you've seen a

2633
02:32:13.201 --> 02:32:14.460
thousand times and you're like,

2634
02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:17.790
this is what you're putting on in between your fucking awesome shows.

2635
02:32:18.450 --> 02:32:21.180
Nothing make a fucking better standard for your commercials.

2636
02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:25.080
Like what was flowing it's bought is very straight pitch.
You know,

2637
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:28.800
use this bank will get you a better Apr.
Mm or not corny.

2638
02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:34.990
It's the time of the intrusive commercial gone intrusive,
isn't she?

2639
02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:38.710
Rusike that seems ridiculous.
Now you're getting those awesome entertainment.

2640
02:32:38.711 --> 02:32:41.700
That's why nobody plays commercials on podcasts and if you want a model of it

2641
02:32:41.701 --> 02:32:43.970
and go a real commercial,
a lot of we still do.

2642
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:47.250
But if you want to watch like a television show at White Castle,

2643
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:50.600
that's why you're a hold of your,
sorry.

2644
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:54.630
If you want to watch a television show on a and e that's also available on

2645
02:32:54.631 --> 02:32:57.890
iTunes and you're going to have to watch with commercial.
What are you talking?

2646
02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:02.820
It's crazy.
Isn't it crazy?
It's crazy.
I haven't watched TV like that and so long.

2647
02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:06.960
It just seems like so crazy what that will be in the future.

2648
02:33:06.961 --> 02:33:09.120
What we think of is blockbuster video right now.

2649
02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:13.020
Like the idea of going to blockbuster and getting a video is so alien right now.

2650
02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:16.920
Like unless you're like in Hawaii,
you know you're staying in a room.

2651
02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:20.610
It has a DVD player.
When the fuck are you renting DVDs.

2652
02:33:20.970 --> 02:33:25.560
You're not never that shit's reluctant.
Redbox,
but that's like Middle America,

2653
02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:31.200
those people,
those fucking miners and shit.
It's like older people,

2654
02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:34.470
they go to the grocery store,
they can pick these sets of standards too.

2655
02:33:34.490 --> 02:33:35.270
Like what are you somebody,

2656
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:37.320
some interviewer asked me like what I think about the standards.
I'm like,

2657
02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:40.290
they're not for the people who would like me.
The standards.

2658
02:33:41.010 --> 02:33:43.230
You're not going to say these words or something like that.
You know?

2659
02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:44.970
I'm like look,
FCC rules.
But like,

2660
02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:49.050
and anyone who would become a fan of mine wouldn't care about those rules.
Yeah.

2661
02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:51.870
So for me to say fuck,
or for me to say something gross,

2662
02:33:51.871 --> 02:33:54.210
it's like none of my fans will care.
Yeah.

2663
02:33:54.211 --> 02:33:58.380
The idea that you're going to like gets a housewives,
what are you doing?

2664
02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:01.740
That's not me and my family get out.
They won't watch anyway.

2665
02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:04.530
There's plenty of dummies out there that don't want to hear your swearing or

2666
02:34:04.531 --> 02:34:07.560
that there would be offended by certain subject matter.

2667
02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:10.440
There's nothing you going to do about that,
but just don't watch.

2668
02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:13.250
But there's so many people.
That's the thing that people are considering that,

2669
02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:16.290
that people never considered when they were giving advice to comics back in the

2670
02:34:16.290 --> 02:34:18.250
day when they're telling them to be clean.
So many people,

2671
02:34:18.251 --> 02:34:21.100
if you get a piece of the Pie Pie's many people,

2672
02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:24.580
you can fill up on a piece of the Pie.
That's the big one,

2673
02:34:24.581 --> 02:34:25.830
1000000th of a percentage.

2674
02:34:25.831 --> 02:34:30.820
The Pi has 300 million possible just to here in this country and look at

2675
02:34:30.821 --> 02:34:33.250
Starbucks.
There are companies like,
oh,
this is great.
We expand,

2676
02:34:33.251 --> 02:34:35.770
expand and not just in Seattle and then I all over the country.
It's like,
great.

2677
02:34:35.771 --> 02:34:40.120
It's like,
oh,
guess what?
The Pie is fucking 18 times that big.
Yeah,

2678
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:41.800
go to the whole world and they're like,
what?

2679
02:34:41.801 --> 02:34:43.450
And then you make so much more money.

2680
02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:48.160
Exactly how I should feel and it's all about the money.
Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

2681
02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:51.820
The five or $10 to get my special pen paid regular.

2682
02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:55.300
That's out right now@alreadyshipper.com it's five or 10 you can get tend to get

2683
02:34:55.301 --> 02:34:59.980
the audio to,
oh you get like a top iTunes on on a on Tuesday.
Oh that's cool.

2684
02:34:59.981 --> 02:35:02.890
So you get like a package deal.
Yeah.
You got a fee.
Yeah.

2685
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:07.360
Damn son moving forward and I'm trying to arrange with comedy central too.

2686
02:35:07.361 --> 02:35:10.120
So we're trying to get this like algorithm or just based on like,

2687
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:12.310
cause they're like starting new system and they're pretty cool.

2688
02:35:12.311 --> 02:35:14.950
They were like all right you've done this online before to us.

2689
02:35:15.010 --> 02:35:16.210
Like what do you got?
Any thoughts?

2690
02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:20.020
And I was like yeah when someone buys a Joe Rogan special after that said you

2691
02:35:20.021 --> 02:35:22.180
might also like,
and then you got to tell,

2692
02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:25.710
find some names of guys like Saguaros half hour of my hour.

2693
02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:26.620
Like yeah that should come up.

2694
02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:29.830
And then if you're like me then after you watch that it's like here's some other

2695
02:35:29.831 --> 02:35:33.550
people you might like,
not just random dudes.
Don't put a Bob Saget after me.

2696
02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:37.110
People you actually do like,
like have it like this is a similar,
don't say oh,

2697
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:41.480
not answering or like have it,
don't say it three times.
It'll show up.
Uh,

2698
02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:45.320
mid Seventies.
Dad,

2699
02:35:46.850 --> 02:35:51.400
dad family kicked the door at some fucking yeah.
Just have shit like that.

2700
02:35:51.401 --> 02:35:53.140
So they try to build something like that for their website,

2701
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.840
for the CC direct stuff.
And it's like,
yeah,
keep building.
Yeah,

2702
02:35:55.841 --> 02:36:00.790
that's a good idea.
Good idea.
All due respect to Dat Pham,
I voted for him.

2703
02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:04.800
Did you first seek first year he was voted,
you actually called it a photo.
It's,

2704
02:36:04.930 --> 02:36:06.790
no,
I was one of the,
I was one of the judges.

2705
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:14.640
I've voted on the show that got him in home opening his phone.

2706
02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:18.040
I'm not going to contribute my part of the solution.

2707
02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:22.540
That was when him and Ralphie may head to head for one and two,
right?
Oh yeah.

2708
02:36:22.541 --> 02:36:26.370
Ralphie may was there.
Who was three that year?
Um,
I don't remember.
Yeah,

2709
02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:30.130
I was just in the beginning like when they were trying out beyond the show.
Oh,

2710
02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:33.430
right.
That was one of the judges on that.
They'd have comics go up and do sets.

2711
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:36.310
You just,
just try it out for the new season.
Really.

2712
02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.410
Cause it was the best trial process ever seen.
Wow.

2713
02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:40.870
They don't reject you or set you right there.
They just,
you go up,

2714
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.960
there's a full crowd at the Improv.
Go Up to three minutes,
get off,
leave.

2715
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:48.020
Who's the host now?
I don't know.
Maybe Wanda Sykes.
Oh,
that's a good move now.

2716
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:51.250
They had her already.
She's built elemis did it for a while,
right?
Yeah,

2717
02:36:51.251 --> 02:36:54.280
he was never here.
How dare you.
He was,

2718
02:36:55.540 --> 02:36:56.590
I'm a fan.

2719
02:36:59.350 --> 02:37:03.520
Bill Bellamy Til I die too.
I thought I forgot.
That was,
that was,
uh,
that was,
um,

2720
02:37:03.610 --> 02:37:07.540
who was Ingram's black character.
What's English black character?

2721
02:37:08.470 --> 02:37:12.790
Darnell.
Darnell.
Darnell.
His favorite topic was the bill Bellamy.
Oh,

2722
02:37:12.791 --> 02:37:15.230
you remember that one bit.
We're here like with the Rolodex.

2723
02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:21.380
<v 3>It's called bitches
sir.</v>

2724
02:37:21.381 --> 02:37:26.060
Now,
or maybe during that was his cousin.
Darnell was his cousin.
What the fuck?

2725
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:28.460
I can't remember his name.
Oh yeah.
Marijuana.

2726
02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:35.060
No character.
His cousin told you.
Hear about Jeremiah.
What happened?

2727
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:38.840
Watkins,
what guide?
Uh,
like a skin cancer.

2728
02:37:38.841 --> 02:37:42.190
And he had got a big chunk taken out of his back.
Whoa.
Yeah.

2729
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:47.020
I'm doing this show tonight and I told you three clubs.
Sure,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2730
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:51.380
He's got a brace on guys.
Why do you have an Arbor?
You answer maybe.

2731
02:37:51.381 --> 02:37:54.800
What if we found out that seat and fucked up my ass and shot his demon load

2732
02:37:55.660 --> 02:37:57.260
wouldn't make cancer through his skin.

2733
02:37:57.460 --> 02:37:59.690
I would make cancer if we found out that he had,

2734
02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:02.800
Jeremiah was just tired of being on the periphery.
It's a funny comics,

2735
02:38:02.820 --> 02:38:05.690
got a lot of talent and just needs to do a lot of these other guys who've done

2736
02:38:05.930 --> 02:38:07.830
this deal with the devil saints.

2737
02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:12.810
We're just going to put the tip in the tip.
People session trust,
you know,

2738
02:38:12.811 --> 02:38:15.030
seem to do much cause you're very talented already.

2739
02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:19.750
I really think have to put the tip.
It's just the tip.
Oh what's that?

2740
02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:25.030
It's hard to relax when you're talking to me like that.

2741
02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:31.370
That was like,
I got a six mile.

2742
02:38:31.390 --> 02:38:36.080
Did you hear the fluttering of his wings?
He shoots his hot load on your back.

2743
02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.530
Hot Olive oil

2744
02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:45.080
as your skin fucking rides in agony.

2745
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:50.300
Whereas load eight through.
That's it.
Folks.

2746
02:38:50.301 --> 02:38:55.220
Can I stay in this podcast?
That's Friday,

2747
02:38:55.370 --> 02:39:00.020
January 16th on where?
1159 on comedy central.

2748
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:02.640
1159 pbrs right now.
Why even right.

2749
02:39:02.641 --> 02:39:07.040
Even risk it will if it's 1159 that means that it's uncensored,
correct?
Yeah.
Yes.

2750
02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:10.070
Beautiful,
glorious uncensored on television.

2751
02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:14.180
He can say Cunty I said contains bleeps over the cuss words.
That's right.
Oh,

2752
02:39:14.181 --> 02:39:18.920
that's good.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Watch that then.
Oh,
that's good.

2753
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:22.430
Oh fuck yeah.
Leaps are annoying.
They do whatever they want.
Yeah,

2754
02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:25.850
and then the following week,
January 22nd Thursday and every Thursday after that,

2755
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.040
this is not happening.
Premiers the first ones with me,

2756
02:39:28.041 --> 02:39:32.180
but I believe Keegan Michael Key crushes on the second one and the intro to the

2757
02:39:32.181 --> 02:39:33.360
second one is amazing jump.

2758
02:39:33.370 --> 02:39:36.050
Tom's like that guy who did the intros to eight different intros for eight

2759
02:39:36.051 --> 02:39:40.880
episodes.
He's out of his mind.
Awesome.
Google lead.
Mooglie,

2760
02:39:40.881 --> 02:39:41.750
ladies and gentlemen,

2761
02:39:41.751 --> 02:39:46.100
could googly mogul Joe Rogan's on week five or six I think for him.

2762
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:48.050
That was fun,
man.
Yeah.
Awesome.

2763
02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:51.080
I love the fact that you're doing in that weird little strip joint place too,

2764
02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:53.930
but he chose place.
Weird environment.
That's such a great vibe.

2765
02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:56.660
A little unpretentious vibe.

2766
02:39:56.661 --> 02:40:00.410
Like I think the vibe of that place like helps those shows because it's not a

2767
02:40:00.411 --> 02:40:03.320
comedy club where you demand like a strip club,
relax.

2768
02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:07.000
What are you upset about it?
So the base themselves here and you,

2769
02:40:07.001 --> 02:40:10.900
you having a lot of people to come on that aren't even comics sheer.
Yeah,

2770
02:40:11.210 --> 02:40:13.560
it's great.
Yeah,
it's good.
Great idea man.
So you get full

2771
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:16.340
<v 0>beautiful.
The see it on comment.</v>

2772
02:40:16.350 --> 02:40:20.960

2773
02:40:20.970 --> 02:40:24.150
We have got this smart,

January 30th I'm at the Mirage in lost wages.

2778
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:47.610
It's Ronnie's fighting again after you told them like you may as well get in

2779
02:40:47.611 --> 02:40:50.850
there and asked to fight again.
Yeah,
he got right back in three weeks later.

2780
02:40:51.270 --> 02:40:55.290
I've never seen twice in a month.
Damn.
It feels good to be a gangster.
God.
Yeah.

2781
02:40:55.291 --> 02:40:59.490
I wish it were coming with him.
Yeah,
that would be cool.
I got all this shit.
Ah,

2782
02:40:59.491 --> 02:41:02.280

Yeah,
I'm good.
I'm going to Boston with the end.

2783
02:41:02.370 --> 02:41:05.330
Was that to Joel Lozan fight?
Was he supposed to told what was supposed to five?

2784
02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:08.850
I think he get hurt.
I don't know if he was supposed to fight Benson body though,

2785
02:41:08.851 --> 02:41:13.290
right?
Yeah.
Yes,

Um,

2786
02:41:13.530 --> 02:41:17.880
Yeah.
Well thanks Joe Rogan.
You Ari.
Shaffir you're fucking awesome.

2787
02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.540
Only reason I come up to the valley,
to the Joe Rogan experience,

2788
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:22.710
but shit on the valley.

2789
02:41:22.770 --> 02:41:27.420
I was born here till I die.
All right.
Uh,
